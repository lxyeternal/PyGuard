  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard setup script for the 'dcor' package.\n- The code reads the version from a local file ('dcor/VERSION') and uses setuptools to find packages and configure setup parameters.\n- No external inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify any issues or vulnerabilities in the code.\n- **Malicious activity:** The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation is observed; all code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk assessment:** Since the code performs only package setup, the security risk is negligible.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is appropriate; there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is correct.\n- The **risk score** is 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical considerations:\n- The only potential concern might be if the 'dcor/VERSION' file is malicious or compromised. However, since the code simply reads from a local file and performs no further processing, this is a minimal risk.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard setup, with no suspicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The provided scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is safe, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
