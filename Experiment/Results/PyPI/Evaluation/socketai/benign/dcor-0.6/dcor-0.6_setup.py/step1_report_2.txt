  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'dcor' Python package, including reading version info and package discovery.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version number from a VERSION file located within the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup configuration is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Reads version from file -> passes data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations using setuptools. It reads the version number from a file within the package directory, which is a common practice. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. There are no external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution. The imports are standard for Python packaging. The code appears to be purely configuration with file reading, which is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
