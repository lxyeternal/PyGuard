{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads version info from a local file and configures package metadata using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'dcor/VERSION' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs processed; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script importing os, pathlib, and setuptools. It reads the package version from a local file, then calls setup() with package discovery and data inclusion. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The version file reading is standard practice; unless the file is maliciously replaced, it does not pose a risk. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package setup code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
