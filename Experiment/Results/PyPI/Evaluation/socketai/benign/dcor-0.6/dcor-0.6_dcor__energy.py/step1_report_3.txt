{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions to compute energy distance metrics for statistical analysis of data vectors, including support for different estimation statistics and customizable averaging methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters `x`, `y`, and `exponent`, which are data arrays; optional `average` function; `estimation_stat` parameter, which can be a string or enum; internal functions `_transform_to_2d`, `pairwise_distances`.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is processed without validation, but the code does not write or transmit data externally. No sinks like network connections, file writes, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data is read from `x`, `y`, `exponent`, and `average`, processed through distance calculations, transformations, and statistical computations, returning a numerical energy distance value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution, are detected. Usage of warnings.warn is standard for input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical distance calculations with well-defined input parameters and internal helper functions. It includes validation of input parameters and uses external libraries for distance computations. No signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The functions are primarily mathematical and statistical, with no suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of energy distance calculations with no malicious intent or security threats detected. It safely processes data inputs for statistical analysis without any harmful behavior.",
