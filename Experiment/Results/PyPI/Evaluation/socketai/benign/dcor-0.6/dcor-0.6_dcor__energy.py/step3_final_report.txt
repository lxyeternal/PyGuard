  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute energy distances between statistical vectors, including handling different estimation statistics and distance exponents.",
  "sources": "Reads input arrays 'x' and 'y', and internal modules 'distances' and '_utils' for distance calculations and array transformations.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file I/O, or network activity; computations are internal.",
  "flows": "Transforms input arrays, computes pairwise distances, and calculates energy distance based on estimation statistics and averaging functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Use of warnings for validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate statistical calculations for energy distances, with proper input validation and clear structure. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are evident. External modules are used for distance computations, which appear standard. The logic correctly handles different estimation statistics and distance exponents.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of energy distance functions with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external modules and input validation warnings, which are standard practices.",
