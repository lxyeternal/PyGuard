  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute distance covariance and correlation statistics for multivariate data, supporting various algorithms and estimators.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'x' and 'y' representing datasets; internal functions accessing numpy and internal modules for calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through internal computational functions, returning numpy arrays with statistical measures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical functions for distance covariance and correlation, utilizing numpy and internal optimized modules. No dynamic code execution, external data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The structure is clear, and the purpose is purely computational. External modules are used for efficiency but in a straightforward manner. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured statistical library component. It poses no security risks or malicious threats. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
