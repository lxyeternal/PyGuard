  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code computes distance covariance/correlation, with data read from arrays `x` and `y`. Results are returned as numpy arrays; no external data transmission or storage is involved.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation. Usage of external modules appears standard. No suspicious code constructs.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard implementation for statistical analysis. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, consistent with the nature of statistical functions).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is typical for statistical libraries; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on distance covariance/correlation functions, with data flowing through internal functions and numpy operations.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. Usage of internal modules is standard.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, performing statistical calculations with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Again, functions process input arrays to compute statistical measures, with internal transformations like `_af_inv_scaled` and `get_namespace`. No external untrusted data sinks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external communication.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard statistical implementation, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Functions compute various distance covariance/correlation metrics, selecting algorithms based on data properties. No external data sinks.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage. Usage of internal modules is typical for performance.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is legitimate and secure.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code computes statistical measures, with data flow confined to internal calculations. No external data leaks or network activity.\n\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. Use of internal modules is standard.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be a proper statistical module with no security risks.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the analysis; no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern, which is reasonable for a statistical library.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, as the code is purely computational with no external dependencies or data leaks.\n\n**In conclusion, the reports' assessments are accurate and justified. The code is a standard, secure implementation of distance covariance and correlation functions with no supply chain security risks.**",
