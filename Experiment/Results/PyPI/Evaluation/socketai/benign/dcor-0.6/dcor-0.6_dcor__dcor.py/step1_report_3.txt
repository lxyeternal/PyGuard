{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to compute various statistics related to distance covariance and correlation, including biased, unbiased, and affinely invariant versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters such as x and y, which are expected to be arrays. It also imports functions from internal modules and numpy.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that perform computations on data, especially those involving get_namespace, _af_inv_scaled, and _dcov_from_terms, which could potentially process or transform data, but do not send data externally or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters x and y into various statistical functions, possibly through internal transformations (_af_inv_scaled), then into distance covariance/correlation functions, and finally produces statistical outputs. No external network or file operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code segments. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement statistical calculations for distance covariance and correlation, utilizing numpy and internal specialized functions. It checks for numerical stability, handles different algorithm choices, and provides both biased and unbiased estimators. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or code that could harm or spy on the system. The use of get_namespace and _af_inv_scaled is consistent with data transformations typical in statistical packages. No malicious payloads or sabotage indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of distance covariance and correlation statistics. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. The code is clean, well-structured, and does not perform any suspicious operations outside its described statistical computations.",
