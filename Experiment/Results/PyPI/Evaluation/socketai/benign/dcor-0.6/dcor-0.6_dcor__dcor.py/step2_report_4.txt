  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides functions for distance covariance and correlation, with standard statistical implementations, no obfuscation, no external data manipulation, and no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low, primarily due to the nature of statistical code, but a small concern for misuse if misapplied)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no suspicious code or behavior is evident. The code is standard for statistical analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard, transparent statistical computations, no suspicious operations, no external or malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; no malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard statistical functions, data flows are internal, no signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; no security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is well-structured, uses internal modules, performs statistical calculations without external data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Very high confidence in benign nature; no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on statistical computations, no external communication, no sabotage or malicious activity detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Assessment:** Clear and consistent; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content & Logic:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured implementation of distance covariance and correlation functions, with no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious patterns.\n- **External Behavior:** No network activity, no file writes, no data exfiltration, or other suspicious side effects.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor concern is misuse of statistical functions, but that is inherent to the purpose of the code, not a security flaw.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of **0**, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- Obfuscation scores are **0**, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n### Risk Scores:\n\n- The reports assign low risk scores (0.1–0.2), which seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n*Justification:* No malicious code, no external communication, no suspicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n*Justification:* Code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python features.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.1**  \n*Justification:* The code is purely statistical; potential misuse is a concern but not a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of distance covariance and correlation functions, with no security or malicious concerns. The existing assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type          | Final Estimate |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| Malware             | 0              |\n| Obfuscated          | 0              |\n| Risk                | 0.1            |\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed review or specific security analysis is required.",
