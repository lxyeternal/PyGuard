  "purpose": "This module computes various statistics related to distance covariance and correlation, including biased and unbiased estimators, as well as affine-invariant measures, for pairs of multi-dimensional datasets.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_dcor_internals, _fast_dcov_avl, _fast_dcov_mergesort, _utils) and data input via function arguments (x, y).",
  "sinks": "Calculation functions that process input arrays to produce statistical metrics; no evident untrusted data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input arrays (x, y) are processed through internal computation functions (_dcov_terms_naive, _distance_covariance_sqr_terms_avl, etc.) to produce covariance and correlation metrics; no external untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code performs statistical computations in a straightforward manner. No dynamic code execution, encryption, or other suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various functions to compute distance covariance and correlation statistics, choosing algorithms based on data type and size. It includes mechanisms for unbiased and affine-invariant measures, utilizing internal optimized algorithms and ensuring numerical stability with abs and sqrt functions. The import statements are from known internal modules, and no external network or file operations are evident. The code appears to be a standard implementation of statistical measures with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of distance covariance and correlation statistics. No malicious or sabotage-related behaviors are detected. The code strictly performs statistical calculations without any suspicious side effects or hidden functionalities.",
