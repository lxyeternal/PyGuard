{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for computing distance covariance and correlation statistics, including biased and unbiased estimators, as well as affine-invariant versions, primarily for statistical analysis of dependencies between random variables or vectors.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (__x, __y), data shape information, and optional parameters such as exponent, method, compile_mode.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations on input data to produce numerical results; does not appear to send untrusted data over network or write to files; no apparent data leaks or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are processed to compute various distance covariance and correlation metrics; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved; calculations are confined to numerical operations within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code utilizes advanced statistical methods with some conditional fast algorithm selection; no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable names. Use of external internals (_dcor_internals) may hide complexity but is standard for performance.",
  "analysis": "The module is focused on distance correlation/statistics calculations, utilizing multiple algorithms and internal functions for efficiency. No indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, file modification, or hidden data exfiltration are present. The code appears to be well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and relies on standard libraries like numpy and internal utilities. No evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious code injection was detected. Usage of external internals is typical for performance optimization and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured statistical analysis module for distance correlation metrics. There are no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. The code does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification activities. Overall, it poses no supply chain security threat.",
