  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the reasonableness of the risk scores, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides functions for distance covariance and correlation calculations, with no external data manipulation, network activity, or code obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and performs legitimate statistical computations.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The report assigns `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0.2`. Given the code's nature, these seem appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on statistical calculations without external data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, dynamic execution, or external communication.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.2` seem reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on statistical functions, no external data manipulation or suspicious operations.\n- **Findings:** The code performs standard statistical routines, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.1` are appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implementation of distance covariance and correlation, algorithm selection, no external data leaks.\n- **Findings:** Well-structured, standard statistical code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0.1` are consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar focus, no suspicious external activity, code obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** Well-structured, relies on internal modules for performance, no signs of sabotage.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0` are justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports indicate no malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, primarily because the code performs statistical calculations without external data leaks, network activity, or code injection.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, given the absence of external threats or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of distance covariance and correlation functions used in statistical analysis. No malicious or obfuscating elements are present, and the external modules used are typical for performance optimization.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are consistent with a benign, legitimate statistical library. The assigned scores are reasonable, but I would suggest setting the overall malware and obfuscation scores to 0, and the security risk to 0.1 to reflect the negligible threat level.",
