{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to compute distance covariance and correlation statistics, including biased and unbiased estimators, and affinely invariant measures, used in statistical analysis of random vectors.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input arrays `x` and `y`, which are user-provided data structures representing random vectors.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; functions mainly perform statistical calculations and return numerical results. No network, file, or system command operations are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays `x` and `y` to various statistical functions (`distance_covariance_sqr`, `distance_stats_sqr`, etc.), which compute statistics and return numerical arrays; no external or untrusted data is introduced or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution (e.g., `exec`, `eval`) are present. The code mainly performs mathematical computations and method dispatch. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured and utilizes standard Python features, including type annotations, dataclasses, and enum classes. It defines protocols for callback functions and methods for selecting algorithms. Functions for computing distance covariance and correlation metrics are implemented using standard numerical operations and conditional logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration. The functions strictly perform statistical calculations based on input arrays, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The presence of detailed comments and the use of established libraries (numpy) suggest the code is intended for statistical analysis rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of distance covariance and correlation statistics for data analysis. There are no indications of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The code's design focuses on computational routines, with no suspicious operations or hidden functionality.",
