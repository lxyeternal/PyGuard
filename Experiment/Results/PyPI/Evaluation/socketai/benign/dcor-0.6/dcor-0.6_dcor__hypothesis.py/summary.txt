  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of permutation hypothesis testing with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the get_namespace utility, which should be verified in the broader context to ensure it does not execute untrusted code. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for scientific analysis."
