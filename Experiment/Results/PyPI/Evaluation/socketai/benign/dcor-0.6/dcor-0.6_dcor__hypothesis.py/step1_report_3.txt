{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a permutation-based hypothesis test on symmetric matrices, likely for statistical analysis or testing significance.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the matrix parameter in _permuted_statistic and _permutation_test_with_sym_matrix, and random_state for permutation generation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that could leak data or perform malicious actions, such as network communication or file writing.",
  "flows": "Input data (matrix and random state) flows through permutation functions to generate permuted matrices, then computes test statistics and p-values, but no untrusted data is used to influence external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. Usage of parallel processing and get_namespace suggests flexibility rather than malicious intent. Warnings are for deprecation, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of permutation tests for matrices, utilizing numpy, joblib, and custom utilities for array handling. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is present. It relies on standard statistical procedures and parallel processing for efficiency. No indications of malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code appears to be well-structured for scientific computing without any hidden or harmful functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical scientific computing utility for permutation hypothesis testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The use of parallel processing and numpy-based data handling is standard. Overall, the code is safe with low malware and security risk scores.",
