  "purpose": "The code implements functions for performing permutation hypothesis testing on symmetric matrices, including calculating statistics and p-values, using parallel processing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Code reads input matrices (matrix parameter), random seed/state (random_state), and permutation indices generated via random_state.permutation.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that lead to data leaks or unauthorized actions; no external data outputs or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input matrix and random seed generate permutations; permutation functions and statistics are computed; results are used to calculate p-values and returned as HypothesisTest objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external network calls, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of warnings for deprecated attributes appears standard. No unusual data handling or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and functions for permutation hypothesis testing, including support for parallel execution via joblib. It securely uses numpy and user-defined utility functions for array handling. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. Usage of warnings for deprecated properties is standard practice. All data flows and input sources appear to be legitimate for statistical computations. No anomalies in code structure, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors were found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of permutation hypothesis testing functions with parallel processing. There are no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
