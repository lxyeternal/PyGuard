  "purpose": "This code performs permutation-based hypothesis testing on symmetric matrices, calculating p-values for statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input matrices, random state generators, and permutation functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs p-values and test statistics; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external systems are evident.",
  "flows": "Input matrices -> permutation generation -> permutation application -> statistic calculation -> p-value computation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are present. Usage of warnings for deprecations is standard. The code relies on external modules, but nothing suspicious is evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard scientific libraries and performs permutation tests for hypothesis testing. It uses a custom namespace getter and random state initialization, which are common in scientific code. The permutation logic is straightforward, employing parallel computation with joblib. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears to be a typical implementation of permutation testing, with proper deprecation warnings and type hints. No indications of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The only minor note is the use of warnings for deprecation, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of permutation-based hypothesis testing with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears safe and does not exhibit malware characteristics.",
