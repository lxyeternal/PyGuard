  "purpose": "Perform permutation-based hypothesis testing on symmetric matrices to evaluate statistical significance.",
  "sources": "Input matrix data, random permutation generator",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data outputs; internal computations only",
  "flows": "Input matrix -> permutation via get_namespace -> permutation applied -> statistic computed -> bootstrap distribution -> p-value calculation",
  "anomalies": "Use of get_namespace could be a vector if it executes untrusted code, but appears to be a utility for handling array types",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard permutation test for symmetric matrices, utilizing numpy and joblib for parallel processing. It includes deprecation warnings and utility functions for array handling. No network, file I/O, or external system interactions are present. The get_namespace function is a potential concern if it executes untrusted code, but in typical usage, it likely handles array types safely. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common statistical testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of permutation hypothesis testing with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the get_namespace utility, which should be verified in the broader context to ensure it does not execute untrusted code. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for scientific analysis.",
