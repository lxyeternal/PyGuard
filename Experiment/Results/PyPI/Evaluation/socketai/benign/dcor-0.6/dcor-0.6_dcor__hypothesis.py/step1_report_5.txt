{
  "purpose": "The code implements statistical hypothesis testing functions, specifically permutation tests on matrices, with parallel processing for efficiency.",
  "sources": "Input data includes matrices passed as arguments to functions, and random state provided via 'random_state'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external output; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input matrices and random states are processed, permuted, and statistical functions are applied within the permutation test functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code relies on external libraries but does not contain malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python and scientific libraries to perform statistical permutation tests, including parallel processing with joblib. It accesses and permutes matrices, computes statistics, and calculates p-values. No suspicious behaviors, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. Usage of warnings and deprecated attribute handling appear benign. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a straightforward implementation of permutation tests with parallel processing, without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe based on the visible content.",
