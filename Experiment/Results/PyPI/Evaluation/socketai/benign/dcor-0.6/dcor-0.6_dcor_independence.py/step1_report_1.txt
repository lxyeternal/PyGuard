{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for testing independence between random vectors using various statistical methods, such as distance covariance and distance correlation tests.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays `x`, `y`, and optionally `z` for partial tests; uses internal functions and standard libraries for mathematical computations.",
  "sinks": "Performs statistical calculations and permutation tests; no evident data leaks or external communications; no data is sent over networks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through internal matrix transformations to statistical test functions; no external or untrusted sources are involved; results are returned as hypothesis test objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Uses standard scientific libraries. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of functions implementing statistical independence tests with permutation-based p-value calculations. It transforms input data into distance matrices, applies mathematical operations, and computes test statistics. All functions rely on trusted libraries (numpy, scipy) and internal utilities for matrix transformations and projections. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling are present. The code structure is consistent with typical statistical testing modules, with clear input and output, and no unusual control flow or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of statistical independence tests with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, external communications, or data leaks. The overall security risk is very low.",
