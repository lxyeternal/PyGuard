  "purpose": "Provides functions for testing independence between random vectors using distance covariance, partial distance covariance, and related statistical measures, primarily via permutation tests and t-distribution approximations.",
  "sources": "Input arrays x, y, z (for partial tests), which are transformed into 2D matrices; internal functions compute distance matrices, projections, and statistical measures.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network communication, or data exfiltration; all operations are internal matrix computations and statistical tests.",
  "flows": "Input data -> matrix transformations and projections -> permutation or distribution-based hypothesis testing -> output hypothesis test results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard statistical tests for independence using well-established methods and internal utilities. It relies on numpy, scipy, and internal modules for matrix operations, projections, and permutation testing. No external communication, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The functions perform matrix transformations, projections, and permutation-based p-value calculations typical for statistical hypothesis testing. The code is modular, clear, and uses standard practices. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of statistical independence tests with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
