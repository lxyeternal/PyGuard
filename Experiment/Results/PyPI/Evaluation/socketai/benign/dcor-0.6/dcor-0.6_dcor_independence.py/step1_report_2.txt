  "purpose": "Provides functions for statistical testing of independence between distributions using distance-based metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (x, y, z) for the statistical tests; uses imported modules for internal calculations and random state initialization.",
  "sinks": "Returns HypothesisTest objects with p-values and statistics; no direct untrusted data sinks evident. No data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are transformed and used in internal calculations for test statistics; permutation tests generate permutations based on internal random state; results are returned as hypothesis objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. Usage of standard statistical methods and internal functions appears normal. No suspicious network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements statistical hypothesis tests for independence using distance covariance and correlation metrics. It employs internal utility functions for matrix transformations, projection calculations, and permutation testing. All operations appear to be standard statistical procedures. No indications of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. No external data transmission, system modification, or suspicious behavior detected. The random state is initialized properly, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of statistical independence tests using distance metrics. It relies on internal and third-party libraries for calculations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
