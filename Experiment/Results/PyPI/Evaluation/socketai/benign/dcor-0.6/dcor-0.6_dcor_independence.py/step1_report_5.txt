{
  "purpose": "Provide statistical tests for assessing independence between random vectors using distance covariance and related metrics.",
  "sources": "Imports of numpy, scipy.stats, and internal modules; functions receiving data arrays (x, y, z); functions generating and manipulating distance matrices; permutation testing functions.",
  "sinks": "Permutation testing functions that might execute untrusted input data; no explicit data sinks like network or file operations; calculations on data arrays are safe assuming proper data validation.",
  "flows": "Data arrays (x, y, z) are processed to compute distance matrices and projections; these matrices are then used in permutation tests to produce p-values and statistics; no external data or untrusted sources directly influence the core calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code uses standard statistical and matrix operations. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements statistical independence tests using distance covariance and related metrics. It carefully transforms input data into 2D arrays, checks for consistent array lengths, and uses permutation-based methods to compute p-values. The functions rely on internal modules for core matrix operations, which appear standard. No signs of malicious behavior such as network access, system manipulation, or data exfiltration. The use of random states and parallel execution is typical for such statistical testing. The overall structure and logic align with common statistical methods, with no anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of independence testing methods based on distance covariance. There are no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage. It is a standard statistical module with no malicious code or security risks evident.",
