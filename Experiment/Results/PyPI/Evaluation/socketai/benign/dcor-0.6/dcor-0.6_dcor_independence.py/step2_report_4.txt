  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and assess the security implications step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations Across All Reports:\n- **Code Purpose & Functionality:** All reports describe code implementing statistical independence tests (distance covariance, distance correlation, partial tests, t-tests) using standard mathematical and statistical techniques.\n- **Data Handling & Flows:** Data flows from input arrays through matrix transformations, projections, and permutation tests, with no external communication, file I/O, or network activity.\n- **Use of Libraries:** Reliance on numpy, scipy, and internal modules for matrix operations, projections, and hypothesis testing.\n- **Security Concerns:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear, standard statistical testing functions.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No anomalies; data flows internally, no external communication.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate implementation with no malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified given the nature of statistical code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard hypothesis testing.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious external data handling or code patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, trustworthy implementation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — justified, consistent with the previous assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous reports.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, standard statistical testing.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Trustworthy implementation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same, standard statistical methods.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No external or malicious activities.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious signs.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Assessment:\n- All reports consistently identify the code as standard, open-source-like statistical testing functions.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious network/system activities.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified across all reports.\n- The security risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting the minimal inherent risk in statistical testing code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (very low, typical for statistical code libraries)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of statistical independence tests with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and trustworthy based on the provided reports.",
