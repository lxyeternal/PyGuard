{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for statistical independence testing between random vectors, including distance covariance and correlation tests, using permutation and t-distribution-based methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameters x, y, z (arrays for testing); internal functions that generate distance matrices, projections, and permutation tests.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to external systems, network, or files. No evident data leaks or insecure outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into distance matrix computations, projections, and permutation tests; results are returned as HypothesisTest objects with p-values and statistics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Usage of standard statistical methods and helper functions. No hidden network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements standard statistical tests for independence based on distance correlation, with permutation resampling and Student's t-distribution approaches. It uses well-known scientific libraries (numpy, scipy) and internal modules for matrix operations and hypothesis testing. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system damage routines. Functions operate on input arrays, compute matrices, and perform permutation or statistical calculations without involving system commands or external system interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of independence testing methods with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses common scientific computation patterns and provides statistical hypothesis testing tools. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are present.",
