{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical functions for testing independence between multiple random vectors using distance covariance and correlation methods.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input arrays (x, y, z), including shape and data values. Uses internal functions for matrix transformations and projections.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present; no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into matrix computations, transformations, and permutation-based hypothesis tests; results are returned as hypothesis test objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code uses standard statistical and matrix operations; no unusual or obfuscated code patterns. Permutation tests and matrix projections are typical statistical procedures.",
  "analysis": "The module implements standard statistical tests based on distance covariance and correlation. It transforms input data into distance matrices, performs matrix centering, projection, and permutation tests. All functions appear to follow standard practices for statistical hypothesis testing. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or system modification code is present. The code's structure and functions are consistent with open-source statistical testing libraries. No anomalies or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of independence testing functions based on distance correlation and covariance. It uses typical statistical techniques and internal helper functions for matrix transformations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
