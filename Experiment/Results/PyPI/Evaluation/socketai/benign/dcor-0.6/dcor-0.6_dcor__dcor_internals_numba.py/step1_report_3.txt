  "purpose": "Define functions for calculating squared distance covariance using Numba-accelerated computations, with options for compiled and uncompiled terms.",
  "sources": "Imports (numba, numpy, typing, internal module), _dcov_from_terms, function parameters (terms_compiled, terms_uncompiled), input arrays x and y.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input arrays x and y flow into the inner function, which then selects between compiled/uncompiled terms and calls the corresponding function, ultimately calling _dcov_from_terms with derived variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of Numba JIT compilation appears standard for performance optimization. No malicious data handling or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases for Numba arrays, imports necessary modules, and compiles a function _dcov_from_terms with Numba. It provides a factory function that creates an inner function to compute squared distance covariance, choosing between compiled and uncompiled terms based on a boolean flag. The inner function takes input arrays and an unbiased flag, extracts several terms from either compiled or uncompiled functions, then calls _dcov_from_terms with these variables. The structure is typical for performance-critical numerical computations and employs safe patterns without evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a distance covariance calculation optimized with Numba. No malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are evident. The use of compiled functions for performance is standard practice.",
