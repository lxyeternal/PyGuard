{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions and type aliases for calculating distance covariance using Numba for JIT compilation, likely part of a statistical or data analysis library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, numba, numpy), and internal module '_dcor_internals'. No external or user input sources are directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Function calls within the code primarily involve mathematical computations and internal functions; no apparent data sinks or output streams are used to send untrusted data or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "The code flow is from input numpy arrays 'x' and 'y' through functions that compute terms for the distance covariance, culminating in a call to an internal function '_dcov_from_terms'. There are no external data outputs or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. Usage of Numba's JIT compilation and internal functions appears standard for performance optimization.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases and internal compiled functions for numerical computations. It conditionally uses compiled or uncompiled terms for distance covariance calculations. There are no external data reads, no network operations, or system modifications present. The functions rely on numerical input data and perform mathematical computations only. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation for distance covariance computation with performance optimization via Numba. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code insertion.",
