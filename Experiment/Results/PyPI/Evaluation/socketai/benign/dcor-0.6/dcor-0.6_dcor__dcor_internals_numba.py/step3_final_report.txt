  "purpose": "Implementation of distance covariance calculation using Numba for performance optimization in statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "Input arrays 'x' and 'y' data, internal functions '_dcov_from_terms', 'terms_compiled', and 'terms_uncompiled' for term calculations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no external data leaks, network activity, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'terms_compiled' or 'terms_uncompiled' functions, then into '_dcov_from_terms', and finally the result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs numerical statistical computations with performance optimization via Numba. It reads input arrays, processes terms through internal functions, and outputs the distance covariance squared. No external system interactions, data leaks, or malicious constructs are present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. The use of internal functions and performance libraries is standard for scientific computing. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, purely computational nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a statistical measure with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The supply chain security risk is negligible. The scores are appropriate, though the security risk could be conservatively lowered to 0.1 given the benign nature.",
