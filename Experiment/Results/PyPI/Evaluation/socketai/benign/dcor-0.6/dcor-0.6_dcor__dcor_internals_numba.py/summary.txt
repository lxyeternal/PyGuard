  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a statistical measure with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The supply chain security risk is negligible. The scores are appropriate, though the security risk could be conservatively lowered to 0.1 given the benign nature."
