{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python package implementation for distance correlation and related statistical measures such as energy distance and hypothesis testing, aimed at statistical analysis and data science tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the file system for the version number via pathlib and os modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; no network, system modification, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns. The import statements and file reading are standard for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules and functions related to statistical computations from internal package modules. It attempts to read the package version from a local 'VERSION' file, handling FileNotFoundError gracefully. All code appears typical for a scientific package, with no dynamic code execution, network access, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The use of standard libraries (os, pathlib) for version management is common and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific Python package source code with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It reads version information from a local file, which is common practice. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code components present.",
