  "purpose": "Provide a Python package for distance correlation and related e-statistics computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules and reading version info from a file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Code reads package version from a file; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads version info from a file; no suspicious or unusual code segments, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of module imports and a version file read operation. It imports various statistical functions and classes from internal modules, which is typical for a scientific library. The version is read from a file named 'VERSION' located in the package directory; a try-except block handles potential FileNotFoundError gracefully. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. No external network calls, no use of untrusted input, and no hardcoded credentials are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computing package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It simply imports functions and classes and reads a version file. No security issues or malware indications are present.",
