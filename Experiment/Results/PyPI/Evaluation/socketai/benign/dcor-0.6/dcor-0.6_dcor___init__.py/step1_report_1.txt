{
  "purpose": "Provide implementations of distance correlation, e-statistics, and related functions for statistical analysis in Python.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from a file; importing modules and submodules; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that send untrusted data; no network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration points observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; imports are static, and version reading is from a local file at package load time.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of imports and package metadata handling. It attempts to read a version string from a 'VERSION' file, which is standard for Python packages. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. All imported modules appear to be part of the package or standard libraries. No anomalies or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script for a Python library related to statistical measures. It does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. The code is benign, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
