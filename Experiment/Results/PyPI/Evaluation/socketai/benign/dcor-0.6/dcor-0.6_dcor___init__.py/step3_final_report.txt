  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python package related to distance correlation and energy statistics, importing modules and functions, and reading version info from a local file.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file; static imports from internal modules",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or untrusted input/output",
  "flows": "Reading version from local file; importing modules and functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization script, importing internal modules and reading a version string from a local file with exception handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The structure and content are typical for a scientific Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
