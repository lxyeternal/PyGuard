{
  "purpose": "This package provides Python implementations for distance correlation and related statistical measures, such as energy distance, for data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads the package directory for the VERSION file; imports various modules and functions from local package files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output are present.",
  "flows": "Reads package version from filesystem; imports functions and classes without data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads a local VERSION file dynamically, which is normal. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no network activity, and no data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports internal modules and functions, and attempts to read a version number from a local file. This is standard for Python packages. The imports and file reading are done safely without any suspicious patterns. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration attempts are present. The logic is straightforward and adheres to common package structure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a Python package that handles statistical calculations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident.",
