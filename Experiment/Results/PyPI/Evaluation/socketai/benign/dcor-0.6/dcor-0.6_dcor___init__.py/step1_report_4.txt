{
  "purpose": "Provide Python implementations of distance correlation, energy distance, and related statistical methods for analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading the package's own modules, internal functions, and the VERSION file for version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could leak data or execute malicious code are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads the __version__ from a local file; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly imports functions and classes from its own modules, which are standard for a Python package. It reads a local VERSION file to determine version info, which is typical. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is detected. The code appears to be a straightforward package initialization and import script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer for a Python statistical library. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks are evident.",
