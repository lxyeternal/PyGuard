  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute partial distance covariance and correlation for statistical analysis of relationships between variables.",
  "sources": "Reads input data arrays (x, y, z), distance matrices (_u_distance_matrix), and internal projection functions (u_complementary_projection, u_product).",
  "sinks": "Outputs computed covariance and correlation values; no untrusted data outputs or external data transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Input arrays -> distance matrix functions -> projection operations -> calculation of partial covariance/correlation values -> return results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of internal utility functions appears standard. No obfuscated code features present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two statistical functions for measuring partial dependence metrics between variables, utilizing distance matrices and projections. It imports necessary utility functions and performs straightforward matrix operations. No data leakage, external communication, or malicious logic such as system commands, network connections, or data exfiltration appears present. The code is clean, well-structured, and focused solely on statistical computations. The initial imports, internal functions, and mathematical operations are typical for such calculations and do not show signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of partial distance covariance and correlation measures for statistical analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. The code performs intended mathematical operations without external side effects or suspicious behavior.",
