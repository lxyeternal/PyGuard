{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for calculating partial distance covariance and correlation, which are statistical measures used to assess dependencies between multivariate data vectors, potentially conditioned on a third variable.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are expected to be arrays of data points, as well as internal functions like `_u_distance_matrix`, `u_complementary_projection`, `u_product`, and `_sqrt` which process these inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data sinks are the internal function calls that compute distance matrices and matrix operations, but these are standard numerical computations. No external network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (`x`, `y`, `z`) into `_u_distance_matrix` functions to produce distance matrices, which then flow into linear algebra functions like `u_product` and into the return statements. No external output or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. All functions appear to perform standard statistical calculations. The module's warning about the limitations of partial distance covariance and correlation demonstrates awareness of statistical nuances but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules and internal utility functions, then defines functions to compute statistical measures related to dependence. All operations are mathematical and data-driven, with no signs of malicious code such as network connections, file manipulations, or code injections. The warnings about the statistical properties are typical disclaimers. There are no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. The functions rely on provided data and internal numerical computations, consistent with legitimate statistical analysis routines.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a standard implementation of statistical dependence measures with no malicious behavior. It performs mathematical calculations for partial distance covariance and correlation using provided data arrays, with appropriate warnings about the statistical limitations. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
