  "purpose": "Functions for computing partial distance covariance and correlation, used for statistical dependency analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays x, y, z; internal utility functions for distance matrix computation and projections.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, file access, or network communication; computations are internal.",
  "flows": "Input arrays processed through internal functions to produce dependency metrics; no external or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external communication detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical calculations for partial distance covariance and correlation using internal utility functions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The internal functions are assumed benign as they perform typical matrix operations. The code is transparent, well-structured, and consistent with standard statistical implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of dependency measures with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is best set at 0, reflecting its purely computational nature.",
