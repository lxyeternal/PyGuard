{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute partial distance covariance and correlation between vectors, used in statistical analysis and dependence testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: x, y, z; and internally calls functions like _u_distance_matrix and other utils.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that send data externally; no network or file operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The functions process input arrays to compute matrices, then perform mathematical operations (projections, products, normalization) on these matrices to produce results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected. Usage of internally imported functions appears standard and relevant to statistical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, defining functions for statistical calculations with proper documentation. It imports internal utilities for distance matrix calculation, projections, and products. No external network or system modification occurs. All data flows are confined to input parameters and internal computations. No suspicious or malicious patterns (e.g., code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications) are present. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of statistical measures, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of partial distance covariance and correlation metrics. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is consistent with standard statistical computation code. No evidence suggests sabotage, malware, or security threats.",
