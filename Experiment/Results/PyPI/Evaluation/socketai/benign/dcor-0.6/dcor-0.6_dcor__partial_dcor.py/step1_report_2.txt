{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to compute partial distance covariance and correlation between multivariate data vectors, with considerations for statistical analysis and dependency measures.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters x, y, z, which are numpy arrays representing random vectors or instances of data, and from imported internal utility functions (_u_distance_matrix, u_complementary_projection, u_product, _sqrt).",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly send data to external sources or networks. It computes and returns numerical values based on the input data. No data leakage, network communication, or external file writing occurs within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters x, y, z into internal functions to compute distance matrices, then through mathematical operations (projections, products) to produce final covariance and correlation estimates.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears standard for statistical computations with clear, documented functions and usage.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on external internal utility functions (_u_distance_matrix, u_complementary_projection, u_product, _sqrt) which are imported, but their implementation details are unknown. The functions compute statistical dependency metrics without side effects. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. The code is well-structured, uses standard numpy operations, and the logic aligns with statistical methods for dependence measurement. No obfuscation, unusual code constructs, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code implements statistical measures for dependency analysis without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-documented implementation of partial distance covariance and correlation. No malicious behavior, malware, or security threats are identified.",
