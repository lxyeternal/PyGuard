{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package 'types-jsonschema' including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the string variables defining package metadata and the setup() function call with its arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the setup() function which performs package installation/configuration, and the 'install_requires' dependency list.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are used as arguments to setup(), which then executes the installation process, installing dependencies and including package data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The dependencies and package data appear standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and configuration for 'types-jsonschema' and calls setup() from setuptools. All elements follow typical structure for a Python package. The 'install_requires' specifies a dependency on 'referencing'. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or malicious instructions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily configures package metadata, dependencies, and package data in a standard manner.",
