  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python stub package providing type annotations for jsonschema.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; variables and string literals defining package metadata; function call to setup() with parameters.",
  "sinks": "setup() function parameters such as name, version, description, long_description, url, project_urls, install_requires, packages, package_data, license, python_requires, classifiers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variable definitions and string literals into the setup() function parameters, which are then used to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. External dependencies are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and data files in a clear, conventional manner. No external input handling, no runtime code execution beyond static setup configuration. All strings and variables are used as part of package configuration without any signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python stub package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present.",
