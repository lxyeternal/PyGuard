  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the validity of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code manages imports, optional dependencies, and API exposure. All sources are internal modules or standard Python practices.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data flows; the code simply imports modules and sets up the API.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The try-except for version info is standard.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct, no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — very low, justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, it handles imports and optional plotting modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident malicious data flow; standard import management.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external data manipulation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages module imports, optional dependencies, and API exposure.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flows; dynamic attribute access is benign here.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** Use of UnsupportedModule is a common pattern; no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — still low, given the benign code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar initialization and dependency management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity; just module imports.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** Standard practices; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malicious code.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n  - Risk: 0 — negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard package setup, optional dependencies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** Typical import handling, fallback functions, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward code.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no apparent security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) in some reports, justified by the use of optional dependencies and dynamic imports, but these are standard practices and do not represent significant security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the entire code and reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to optional dependencies and dynamic imports, but nothing suspicious.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical package initialization script with no signs of supply chain threats, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The current scores are reasonable and reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider the context of the entire package; based solely on this module, the security posture appears solid.",
