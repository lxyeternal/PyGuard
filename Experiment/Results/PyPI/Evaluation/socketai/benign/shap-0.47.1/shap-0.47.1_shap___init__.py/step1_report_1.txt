{
  "purpose": "This module initializes and manages imports, conditional features, and public API definitions for a Python package related to explainability, plotting, and utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules, optional external dependencies (matplotlib), and dataset/utilities/action modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic import failures, optional plotting functions, and attribute accessors, but none directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing core components, attempting optional matplotlib import (which controls subsequent plot-related imports), and defining public API exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code employs standard patterns for optional dependencies and API exposure. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional importing based on the availability of matplotlib, defining fallback functions that raise informative errors if unavailable. It organizes API exports clearly, with no signs of malicious code or anomalous behavior. All import paths and operations are typical for a Python package setup. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The module is a standard initialization script for a Python package with optional dependencies and API management. It does not contain any malicious behavior or supply chain security risks.",
