  "purpose": "Manage imports, optional dependencies, and API exposure for a Python package related to explainability and visualization.",
  "sources": "Internal modules, optional dependencies (matplotlib), environment variables, fallback functions",
  "sinks": "No external data flow, network activity, or data leaks detected",
  "flows": "Import statements and attribute access, primarily internal module loading",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattribute__ in UnsupportedModule to raise errors; standard pattern for optional features",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initialization script that manages optional dependencies, versioning, and API exposure. It uses standard try-except blocks for optional imports, defines fallback functions that raise informative errors, and conditionally loads plotting modules based on the presence of matplotlib. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of dynamic attribute access in UnsupportedModule is benign and common for optional features. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores accurately reflect its benign nature. I recommend maintaining the malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and setting the risk score to 0, indicating minimal security concern.",
