{
  "purpose": "This module sets up imports and configurations for a Python package related to explanations, plots, and utilities in machine learning interpretability.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_explanation, explainers, datasets, links, utils, etc.), conditional import of matplotlib, dynamic assignment of plot functions based on matplotlib availability, and version handling.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or external network connections are directly used within this code.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and assigns functions; no data flow from external sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports and conditional assignment for plotting functions; no suspicious code behavior or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard import operations, handles optional dependencies (matplotlib), and sets up the package's public API. It includes exception handling for version import and fallback implementations if matplotlib is missing. No code injections, network communications, or malicious logic are present. The pattern of conditional imports and dynamic function assignment is typical for managing optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup script for a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It manages optional plotting capabilities gracefully. The overall security risk is negligible.",
