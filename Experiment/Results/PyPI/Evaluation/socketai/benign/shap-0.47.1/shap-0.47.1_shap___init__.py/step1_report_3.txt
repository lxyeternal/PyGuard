{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package's module imports, handles optional dependencies, and defines the public API for a machine learning explainability library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, try-except blocks, attribute access, conditional imports based on availability of 'matplotlib', and module definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic attribute access (__getattribute__), import of various submodules, and function definitions that could potentially be misused if malicious code is present elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Imports and conditional loading flow from the package's internal modules to the public API, with no evident untrusted data input flow. The dynamic attribute access could be exploited if malicious code modifies object attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a generic UnsupportedModule class that raises ImportError on attribute access; conditional imports based on optional dependency 'matplotlib'. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module imports, optional dependencies, and API exposure. It uses try-except to handle missing dependencies gracefully and defines fallback behaviors, which is standard. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The dynamic attribute handling in UnsupportedModule is benign as it only raises errors. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic was detected. Overall, the code is a typical package setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured module setup for a Python package. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected based on the provided code. It manages dependencies and public API exposure securely.",
