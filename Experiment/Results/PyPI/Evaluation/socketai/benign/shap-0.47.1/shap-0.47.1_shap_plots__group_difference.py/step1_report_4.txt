{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python function to plot differences in SHAP values between two groups, aiding in interpretability and fairness analysis of machine learning models.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters: shap_values (model output or SHAP values), group_mask (boolean group identifiers), feature_names (list of feature labels), and optional plotting parameters (xlabel, xmin, xmax, max_display, show, ax).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; it primarily produces a visualization output using matplotlib.",
  "flows": "Input data (shap_values, group_mask) is used to compute statistical differences, which are then visualized on a plot. The data flows from parameters into calculations and finally into rendering functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code performs standard statistical sampling and plotting routines without obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard plotting and numerical libraries, performs group-wise calculations and bootstrap confidence interval estimation, and creates a horizontal bar plot. It includes standard plotting procedures, input validation, and optional parameters for visualization. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization utility for analyzing SHAP values between groups. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and appears to serve a legitimate purpose in model interpretability. There is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
