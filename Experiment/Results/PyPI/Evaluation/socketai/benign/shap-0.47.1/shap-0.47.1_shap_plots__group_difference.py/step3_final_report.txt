  "purpose": "Visualize the difference in mean SHAP values between two groups, including confidence bounds, for interpretability and fairness analysis.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays (shap_values, group_mask), optional feature_names, plotting parameters, and external colors module.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions that generate visual output; no data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Calculates group differences -> bootstrap confidence bounds -> sorts features -> plots horizontal bar chart with confidence intervals.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. External 'colors' module assumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard statistical bootstrap sampling to estimate confidence intervals, handles both vector and matrix inputs gracefully, and produces a clear visualization of feature importance differences. It uses common libraries (numpy, matplotlib) and typical plotting routines without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No external network calls, data leaks, or obfuscation techniques are present. The code's purpose aligns with interpretability tasks, and all operations are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent visualization utility for analyzing group differences in SHAP values. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor security risk score of 0.1 assigned in one report appears to be an overestimate; given the benign nature, it should be adjusted to 0.0.",
