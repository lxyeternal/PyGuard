{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to plot the difference in mean SHAP values between two groups for feature importance analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'shap_values' (model output or SHAP values) and 'group_mask' (group indicator). Uses 'feature_names' for labeling.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a matplotlib plot displaying the feature differences; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Reads 'shap_values' and 'group_mask', computes differences, confidence bounds, and plots results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code performs legitimate statistical and plotting operations without hidden functions.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates statistical differences between groups' SHAP values, generates confidence intervals via resampling, and produces a horizontal bar plot. It uses standard numpy, matplotlib, and a custom 'colors' module for consistent coloring. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification functions are present. The code appears straightforward and aligns with typical data visualization practices in model interpretability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate visualization tool for group comparison of SHAP values. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified. It functions solely as a plotting utility for model interpretability.",
