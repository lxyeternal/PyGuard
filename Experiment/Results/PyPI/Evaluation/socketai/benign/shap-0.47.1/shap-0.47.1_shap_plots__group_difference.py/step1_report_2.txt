{
  "purpose": "The code generates a plot visualizing the difference in mean SHAP values between two groups for model interpretability, particularly for fairness analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the shap_values and group_mask arrays, and feature_names if provided.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a matplotlib plot; no data leaks or insecure data handling are evident.",
  "flows": "Reads input data (shap_values, group_mask, feature_names) -> computes group differences -> generates plot -> displays plot if show is True.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard usage of numpy, matplotlib, and external colors module. No suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary libraries and defines a function to plot group differences in SHAP values. It performs bootstrap sampling to compute confidence intervals, sorts features by importance, and generates a horizontal bar chart. The plotting logic uses standard matplotlib calls, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or suspicious behavior. External 'colors' module usage is benign, assuming it defines color constants. The function's parameters and internal logic are consistent with data visualization purposes. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data visualization function for analyzing SHAP values across groups. It performs legitimate statistical calculations and generates a plot without any malicious or suspicious behaviors.",
