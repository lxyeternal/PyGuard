{
  "purpose": "This code generates a plot visualizing the difference in mean SHAP values between two groups, useful for interpretability and fairness analysis in machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Reads numpy arrays (shap_values, group_mask), optional feature_names, plotting parameters (xlabel, xmin, xmax, max_display, sort, show, ax).",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib for plotting; no untrusted data output or external network connections observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs (shap_values, group_mask, feature_names) are used to compute differences and confidence bounds; these are visualized via matplotlib plotting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be straightforward data processing and plotting.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates confidence bounds for group differences using bootstrap sampling, handles both vector and matrix forms of SHAP values, manages feature naming, sorts features by importance if requested, and plots horizontal bar charts with confidence intervals. No external calls besides standard plotting and numpy operations, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard visualization utility for SHAP value differences with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on input data for interpretability purposes.",
