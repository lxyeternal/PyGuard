  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent visualization utility for analyzing group differences in SHAP values. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minor security risk score of 0.1 assigned in one report appears to be an overestimate; given the benign nature, it should be adjusted to 0.0."
