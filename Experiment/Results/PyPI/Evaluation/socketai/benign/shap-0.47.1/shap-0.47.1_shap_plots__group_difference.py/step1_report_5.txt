{
  "purpose": "The code generates a plot visualizing the difference in mean SHAP values between two groups, primarily for model interpretability and fairness analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads numpy arrays (`shap_values`, `group_mask`), optional feature names (`feature_names`), and plotting inputs (`ax`, `xlabel`, `xmin`, `xmax`, `max_display`, `show`).",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib to produce and display a plot; no data outputs or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Input numpy arrays are processed to compute group differences, confidence bounds are generated via bootstrap sampling, and results are visualized through bar plots. The plotting functions directly display the visualization if `show` is True.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code features. The logic is straightforward and consistent with standard plotting procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard plotting and numerical libraries, defines a function to visualize group differences in SHAP values with confidence bounds using bootstrap sampling. It performs statistical calculations, sorts features based on importance, and generates a horizontal bar plot with confidence intervals. No external data exfiltration, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not include any network communication, system commands, or suspicious behavior. It relies solely on numpy and matplotlib, which are common in data analysis scripts. There are no indications of code injection, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. The code appears to be a benign visualization utility intended for interpretability tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate plotting function for model interpretability metrics. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It performs statistical computations and visualization in a standard manner without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
