      "conclusion": "The source code is a standard serialization framework that, due to its reliance on pickle and cloudpickle without safeguards, is highly vulnerable to malicious payloads during deserialization. It contains no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The main risk stems from unsafe deserialization practices, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if untrusted data is processed. Therefore, the code should be used with strict input validation, sandboxing, or alternative safer serialization methods to mitigate these risks."

It only uses standard libraries for plotting and data handling, with comprehensive input validation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or external data leaks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified."
