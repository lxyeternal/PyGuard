  "purpose": "Define and assign inverse functions for identity and logit link functions using Numba for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to identity, _identity_inverse, logit, and _logit_inverse functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; the functions perform mathematical transformations only.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the functions to produce transformed output, with inverse functions assigned as attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code solely implements mathematical functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mathematical functions (identity, logit) and their inverses, compiled with Numba for speed. Inverse functions are assigned as attributes to the original functions. There are no sources that read untrusted input or sinks that output untrusted data. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. It appears to be a utility module for statistical or machine learning computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of mathematical link functions and their inverses with performance optimization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
