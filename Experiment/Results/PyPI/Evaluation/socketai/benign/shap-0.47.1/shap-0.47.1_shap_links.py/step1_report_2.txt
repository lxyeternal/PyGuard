  "purpose": "Define and assign inverse functions for identity and logit link functions, optimized with Numba for performance.",
  "sources": "Functions receive input parameters, mainly numeric values or arrays, from caller functions.",
  "targets": "Mathematical operations (log, exp, division) that process the input data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the functions and is processed by mathematical operations; results are returned, possibly used downstream.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and mathematically oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic mathematical link functions (identity and logit) with their inverses, utilizing Numba for performance. No external data sources, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. The functions are standard in statistical modeling, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are evident. The code does not perform any file I/O, network communication, or system modifications. The purpose appears to be mathematical utility functions with performance optimization.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines mathematical link functions and their inverses with performance enhancements, without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no security risks or malware indications. The code is safe and typical for numerical computations.",
