  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Implements identity and logit functions and their inverses.\n- Uses Numba's njit decorator for performance optimization.\n- Attaches inverse functions as attributes.\n- Performs straightforward mathematical operations: logarithm, exponential, division.\n- No external data sources, network activity, file I/O, or obfuscation.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the descriptions: simple mathematical functions with inverse attachments.\n- No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n- The functions are standard in statistical modeling.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **No input validation:** While not necessarily a flaw, adding input validation (e.g., ensuring `x` in (0,1) for `logit`) could improve robustness, but its absence doesn't indicate malicious intent.\n- **No security vulnerabilities:** The code performs purely mathematical operations with no external dependencies that could introduce security issues.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the code.\n- Risk scores are 0 or very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or above), justified given the straightforwardness.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- No data leakage or backdoors.\n- The code's purpose is clear: utility functions for statistical modeling.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code could be improved with input validation, but this does not impact security.\n- The functions are standard and do not pose risks even if misused.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a typical implementation of mathematical link functions with inverse functions, optimized with Numba.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The logic is sound, and the functions are safe for use in statistical or machine learning contexts.\n\n**Final note:** I agree with the assessments in the reports, and I would maintain the scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
