{
  "purpose": "Define and assign inverse functions for identity and logit link functions using Numba for JIT compilation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the input parameters 'x' for the functions 'identity', '_identity_inverse', 'logit', and '_logit_inverse'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that send data externally or perform any harmful operations; all functions return computed values without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' is processed through the functions and their inverses, but there are no external data flows or malicious data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. Functions are straightforward mathematical operations. Assigning inverse functions as attributes is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple mathematical link functions ('identity' and 'logit') and their inverses, compiled with Numba for efficiency. The functions perform standard mathematical calculations (identity and log-odds transformations). The inverse functions are assigned as attributes to the original functions, a common pattern for linked functions. No external data access, network activity, or malicious code behavior is observed. The code does not include obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic. Overall, the code appears to serve a mathematical or statistical purpose without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of link functions and their inverses, compiled with Numba for performance. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, utility-like module for mathematical transformations.",
