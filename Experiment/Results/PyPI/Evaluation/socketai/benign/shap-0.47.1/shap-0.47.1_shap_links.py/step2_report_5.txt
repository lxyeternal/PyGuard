  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Defines identity and logit functions with their inverses, using Numba for performance. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns with the straightforward mathematical utility code presented.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the purpose and safe implementation of link functions with performance optimization.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the same purpose, no anomalies, straightforward mathematical functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard mathematical functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard implementation, no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious behavior. The code is purely mathematical, with no network, file I/O, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Clear, straightforward code; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (simple mathematical functions with inverse assignments), the risk score should remain very low, close to 0.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard implementation of link functions used in statistical modeling, with performance optimization via Numba.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The functions are deterministic, mathematical, and do not handle untrusted data sources in a suspicious manner.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the code is benign. No changes needed to the scores or analysis.",
