  "purpose": "Define and attach inverse functions for identity and logit link functions, optimized with Numba for performance.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (x).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output or data leakage points; functions return transformed data.",
  "flows": "Input x → function computations → return results; no external data flow or untrusted source handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; usage of Numba for performance is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines mathematical functions (identity and logit) with their inverses, optimized with Numba's JIT compilation. The functions perform standard mathematical operations (logarithm, exponential, division) for common link functions used in statistical models. The inverse functions are attached as attributes, which is a typical design pattern. No input validation, environment variable access, or data leakage mechanisms are present. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of link functions and their inverses using Numba, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be intended for use in statistical or machine learning models, with no malicious behavior detected.",
