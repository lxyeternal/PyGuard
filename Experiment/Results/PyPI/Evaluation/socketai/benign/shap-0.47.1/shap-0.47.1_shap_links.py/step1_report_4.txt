{
  "purpose": "Define and assign inverse functions for various link functions (identity and logit) using numba for JIT compilation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters `x` in `identity`, `_identity_inverse`, `logit`, `_logit_inverse`",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data being sent to external systems or used insecurely",
  "flows": "Input `x` flows into the functions and returns computed values; no external data or output flows observed",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward mathematical function definitions",
  "analysis": "The code imports numba and numpy, then defines several functions with numba's njit decorator for performance. These functions implement identity and logit transformations and assign inverse functions as attributes. The code appears to be standard mathematical functions used in statistical modeling, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated logic. No external data, network access, or harmful operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of link functions with inverses, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as mathematical utility functions, typical in statistical or machine learning applications.",
