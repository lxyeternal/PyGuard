  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines four functions: `identity`, `_identity_inverse`, `logit`, `_logit_inverse`.\n   - The inverse functions are attached as attributes (`identity.inverse`, `logit.inverse`).\n   - The functions perform standard mathematical operations: identity (no-op), logit (log-odds), and their inverses.\n   - The code uses Numba's `njit` decorator for performance optimization.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code appears correct and straightforward.\n   - No input validation or error handling is present, but given the context (mathematical functions), this is typical.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security concerns are evident.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as standard mathematical functions with no malicious intent.\n   - They highlight the use of Numba for performance, proper function definitions, and attribute assignment for inverses.\n   - No report raises concerns about security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is suggested.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0 or very low, which aligns with the analysis. The code is a utility module with no security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**:\n   - No discrepancies are apparent. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the scores are reasonable.\n\n6. **Overall Justification**:\n   - The code is a standard implementation of link functions used in statistical modeling.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - The high confidence scores reflect this assessment.\n\n7. **Final Estimation**:\n   - **Malware**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated**: 0\n   - **Risk**: 0\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, well-understood, and typical for its purpose. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and carries no security risks or malware concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
