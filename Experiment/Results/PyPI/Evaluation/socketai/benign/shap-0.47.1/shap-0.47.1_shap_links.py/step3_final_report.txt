{
  "purpose": "Provides mathematical link functions (identity and logit) and their inverses, optimized with Numba for performance.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'x' in each function, potentially from external data or user input.",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform pure calculations without side effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' flows through the functions to produce transformed outputs; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard mathematical functions with inverse attribute attachments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines identity and logit functions with their inverses, using Numba's njit for optimization. Functions perform standard mathematical operations: identity returns input, logit computes log-odds, and their inverses perform exponential and logistic transformations. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present. The functions are typical in statistical modeling contexts. No external data access, network activity, or data leakage is evident. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of anomalies or security issues. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of link functions used in statistical modeling, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and should be maintained.",
