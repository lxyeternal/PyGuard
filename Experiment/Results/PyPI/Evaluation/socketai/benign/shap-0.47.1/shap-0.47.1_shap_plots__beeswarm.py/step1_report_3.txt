{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for visualizing SHAP values through various plots such as beeswarm, summary, and violin plots, primarily for interpretability of machine learning models.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from shap_values, features, feature_names, and potentially environment variables or external libraries (matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scipy).",
  "sinks": "Uses matplotlib for plotting; does not write to files or network. No direct data leakage or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Processes shap_values and features; visualizes data via matplotlib scatter, bar, and fill_between functions; no untrusted data flow leading to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscation, code injection, or dynamic code execution detected. No suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is predominantly standard visualization routines utilizing well-known libraries (matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pandas). It performs data validation, plotting, and feature handling in a conventional manner. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network connections, system modifications, or hidden behaviors are found. The use of random shuffling is controlled and consistent with plot noise addition. No handling of sensitive data or environment variables that would suggest malicious intent. The code appears to be an open-source visualization utility for SHAP explanations with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate visualization module for SHAP data with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is safe for use in open-source or production environments, with no indication of security risks beyond standard plotting functions.",
