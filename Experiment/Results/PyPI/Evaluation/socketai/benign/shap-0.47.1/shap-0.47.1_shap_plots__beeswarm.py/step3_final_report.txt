{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for SHAP explanations, including beeswarm and summary plots, to interpret model outputs.",
  "sources": "Reads SHAP values, feature data, feature names, clustering info, and plotting parameters; no external system or network I/O.",
  "sinks": "Outputs visual plots via matplotlib; no data exfiltration, network activity, or file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data (SHAP values, features) flows into plotting routines, resulting in visualizations displayed or returned for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard scientific libraries for data validation, clustering, and plotting. It performs input validation, feature handling, clustering, and visualization with no signs of malicious behavior. Use of np.random for shuffling is typical for visualization noise and not malicious. No network or file I/O is present. The code is transparent, well-structured, and adheres to common practices for interpretability tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent visualization utility for SHAP explanations with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is negligible (0 or very close to 0).",
