{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load various datasets (ImageNet50, California housing, Linnerud, IMDB, communities and crime, diabetes, iris, adult, NHANESI, corrgroups60, independentlinear60, a1a, rank) from external URLs, local cache, or scikit-learn, for use in data analysis and machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Datasets are fetched from URLs (GitHub, external repositories), local cache files, or scikit-learn functions. Data is read into numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, or scipy sparse matrices.",
  "sinks": "Data is loaded into memory structures (numpy arrays, DataFrames, sparse matrices) without executing untrusted code or manipulating data maliciously.",
  "flows": "Dataset URLs or files are retrieved via cache(), data is loaded into memory, optionally sampled, and returned for use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. Use of urlretrieve() and external URLs is standard for dataset download.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward dataset loading functions with proper data handling. No code execution, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. External URLs are from reputable sources, and data is processed into safe structures. Sampling is performed via utility functions. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of standard dataset loaders with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are accurate. The small security risk score (~0.1) due to reliance on external data sources is justified but does not indicate malicious activity.",
