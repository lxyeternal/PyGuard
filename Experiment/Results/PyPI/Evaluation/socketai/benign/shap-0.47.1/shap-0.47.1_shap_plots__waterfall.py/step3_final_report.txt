{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization functions for SHAP explanations, specifically waterfall plots, to illustrate feature contributions to model predictions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from Explanation objects, pandas Series, numpy arrays, and function parameters such as shap_values, features, and expected_value.",
  "sinks": "Produces matplotlib plots; no external data transmission, network activity, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (shap_values, features, expected_value) flow into plotting routines, generating visual elements without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected. Input validation is thorough, and no external system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles visualization of explanation data using standard libraries (matplotlib, numpy, pandas). It performs input validation, handles pandas Series, numpy arrays, and Explanation objects, and generates detailed plots with multiple axes and annotations. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The routines are straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The validation and plotting logic are consistent with benign visualization utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured visualization utility for SHAP explanations with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It only uses standard libraries for plotting and data handling, with comprehensive input validation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or external data leaks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
