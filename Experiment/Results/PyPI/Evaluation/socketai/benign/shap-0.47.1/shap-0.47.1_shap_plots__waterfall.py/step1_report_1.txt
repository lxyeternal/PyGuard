{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate waterfall plots for explaining machine learning model predictions using SHAP values.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (matplotlib, numpy, pandas) and local modules (.., ._labels, ._style). No external data sources or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only generates plots based on provided explanation objects and data. No untrusted data output or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Input Explanation objects and data (features, shap_values, etc.) flow through the functions to produce plots; no external data or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden operations. The code strictly handles visualization logic and data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements plotting routines for SHAP explanation data, utilizing standard libraries and local styling functions. It performs validation on input types and shapes, and handles pandas Series, numpy arrays, and explanation objects. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or external data leaks are present. The functions do not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. The code's purpose aligns with transparent visualization of model explanations, with no suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured plotting utility for model explanation visualization. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
