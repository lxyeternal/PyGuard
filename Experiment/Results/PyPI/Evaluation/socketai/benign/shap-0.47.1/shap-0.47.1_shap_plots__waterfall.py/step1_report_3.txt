{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate waterfall plots for explaining machine learning model predictions using SHAP values.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the shap_values object, including feature data, SHAP values, feature names, and optional bounds; it also reads plot styling and configuration from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visual plots via matplotlib; it does not send or store data externally, nor does it include network or file writing operations.",
  "flows": "Inputs (shap_values, features, feature_names) are used to generate and customize plots; no data is sent elsewhere or leaked externally. The plotting functions manipulate visual elements but do not process untrusted data in a way that causes security vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code adheres to typical plotting routines and does not perform any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines functions for plotting explanations of model predictions using SHAP values. It includes standard input validation, handling of data objects (like pandas Series), and plotting routines with styling. No network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. All data manipulations are confined to visual representation. No malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms are observed. The code appears focused on visualization, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate visualization utility for SHAP explanations. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It reads input data, processes it for visualization, and displays plots. There are no external data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads present.",
