{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate waterfall plots for explaining individual predictions of machine learning models using SHAP values.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments (shap_values, features, expected_value, etc.), as well as from imported modules and external data such as pandas Series and numpy arrays.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs visualizations via matplotlib, which may involve rendering graphics but do not involve data leaks or external system effects. No network or file system operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Input data (shap_values, features, expected_value) are processed to determine feature impacts and are visualized via matplotlib functions, with no external data or untrusted sources influencing the logic beyond passed parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code strictly generates plots based on provided data without hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines two plotting functions for visual explanation of model predictions. It includes input validation, data processing, and detailed plotting routines with no external system interactions, network calls, or code execution beyond standard matplotlib usage. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present. The functions do perform potentially sensitive operations like handling explanation data but do so transparently for visualization purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured visualization utility for SHAP explanations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not handle untrusted external sources or perform harmful actions. The design is standard for plotting functions, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
