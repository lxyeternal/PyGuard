  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured visualization utility for SHAP explanations with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It only uses standard libraries for plotting and data handling, with comprehensive input validation. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or external data leaks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified."
