  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, no external data sources or input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; purely static assignment of version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for version definition.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information for a package, including version string and tuple. It uses conditional typing imports which are standard and benign. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no sensitive data handling. It appears to be boilerplate generated by setuptools-scm, with no suspicious behavior or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version definition snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
