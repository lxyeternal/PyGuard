  "purpose": "Define version-related metadata for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, type checking block",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "None; simple variable assignments without external input or output",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module defining version metadata, including a version string and tuple. It uses a type-checking block that imports typing constructs conditionally. All operations are static assignments with no external data inputs, network activity, or code execution beyond variable definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent. The comments specify that the file is auto-generated by setuptools-scm and should not be altered or tracked in version control, consistent with normal package versioning practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as a version metadata container for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
