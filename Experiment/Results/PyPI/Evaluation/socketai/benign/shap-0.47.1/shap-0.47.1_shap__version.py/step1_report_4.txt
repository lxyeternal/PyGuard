  "purpose": "Define versioning information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional TYPE_CHECKING block is standard; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version variables and assigns static version information. It includes a conditional type checking block that does not execute at runtime. All variables are assigned static, hardcoded version data. There are no signs of malicious logic, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be boilerplate version info generated by a tool, with no external input handling or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard version declaration boilerplate with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply sets version variables for package metadata.",
