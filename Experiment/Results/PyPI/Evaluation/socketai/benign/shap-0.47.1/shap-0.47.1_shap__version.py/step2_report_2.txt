  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version declaration module generated by setuptools-scm. The code consists solely of static variable assignments, conditional type hints, and no external data handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**  \n   No errors or flaws are evident in the reports. They accurately describe the code's purpose and structure. The logic is sound, and the reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is clear and not obfuscated.  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given there's no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is correct. The code is purely for version info, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware Consideration:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, matching the code's nature. No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code as boilerplate, auto-generated, and benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no overestimation or underestimation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign version declaration module with no security risks or malicious intent.**",
