  "purpose": "Define version information and type annotations for the package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, type checking condition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; static version assignment.",
  "flows": "Version strings are assigned directly to module variables; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward version information setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version variables and type annotations, including conditional imports for type checking. It assigns hardcoded version strings and tuples, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling. No obfuscated code, no code injection, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe version declaration generated by setuptools-scm with no malicious intent or security risks.",
