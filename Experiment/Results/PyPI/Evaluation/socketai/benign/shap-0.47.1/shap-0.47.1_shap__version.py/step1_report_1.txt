  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns static version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information variables with static, hardcoded values. It uses standard Python idioms for type checking and variable assignment. There are no inputs, external data reads, or potential data leaks. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code’s structure and content are typical for a package version module generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration file with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It merely defines static version information for the package.",
