{
  "purpose": "This code constructs and encodes a metrics string for use with a statsd client, including optional tags and sampling rate.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the 'build' function: name, namespace, value, type_, tags, sample_rate.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'build' function, which encodes the metrics string in UTF-8.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are combined and formatted into a string, which is then encoded to bytes for transmission or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. Use of type annotations and straightforward string formatting. No use of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'build' and 'build_tags'. 'build' constructs a metrics string with optional namespace, tags, and sample rate, then encodes it to bytes. It relies on 'typedefs' for type safety but does not perform any external system calls or insecure operations. 'build_tags' concatenates key-value pairs into a comma-separated string. No obfuscated code, suspicious API calls, or malicious patterns observed. The code appears to be a standard utility for metrics formatting without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for building and encoding metrics data with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
