{
  "purpose": "The code constructs a formatted byte string for metrics data, including optional tags and sample rate, likely for sending to a metrics server like StatsD.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to 'build' function: name, namespace, value, type_, tags, sample_rate; and the 'tags' dictionary in 'build_tags'.",
  "sinks": "The returned byte string is the primary output; no direct sinks to external systems or sensitive data leaks are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate a formatted string, which is encoded as UTF-8 bytes and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. No dynamic execution or suspicious imports detected.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly constructs a metric string with optional namespace, sample rate, and tags. Usage of type annotations and string formatting is straightforward. No external data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The 'typedefs' are assumed to be well-defined external types, and their usage appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for building metric strings, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It appears safe and purpose-driven.",
