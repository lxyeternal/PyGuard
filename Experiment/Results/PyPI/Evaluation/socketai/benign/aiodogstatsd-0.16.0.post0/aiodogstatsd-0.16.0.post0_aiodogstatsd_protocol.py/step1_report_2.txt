{
  "purpose": "Constructs a metrics string for a metrics collection system, formatting data with optional tags and sample rate.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: name, namespace, value, type_, tags, sample_rate",
  "sinks": "Return value is a formatted byte string; no direct sinks processing untrusted data in a dangerous way",
  "flows": "Inputs (name, namespace, tags, etc.) are combined and formatted into a string, then encoded to bytes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. The code performs straightforward string formatting and encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code receives parameters for metrics data, including optional namespace, tags, and sample rate. It constructs a metrics string according to typical metrics protocol formatting rules. 'build_tags' joins key-value pairs from a dictionary into a comma-separated string. No external data sources, network activity, or code execution occurs. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears to be a simple, standard implementation for building metric strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal utility for formatting metrics data; there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It does not handle untrusted input in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities.",
