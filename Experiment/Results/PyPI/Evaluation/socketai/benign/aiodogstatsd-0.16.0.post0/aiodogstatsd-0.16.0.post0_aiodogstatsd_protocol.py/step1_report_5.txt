  "purpose": "Constructs a metric string for DogStatsD with optional tags and sample rate, encoding it as bytes for network transmission.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: name, namespace, value, type_, tags, sample_rate",
  "sinks": "Return statement that encodes the constructed string into UTF-8 bytes",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> String formatting and concatenation -> Encoding as bytes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of f-strings for string formatting is standard. No external or untrusted input handling beyond parameters. The code relies on the typedefs module for data types but does not perform any unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'build' and 'build_tags'. 'build' constructs a DogStatsD metric string based on inputs, optionally including namespace, sample rate, and tags. 'build_tags' converts a dictionary of tags into a comma-separated string. The functions use standard string formatting and encode the final string to UTF-8. No untrusted data handling, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. No external network calls, file operations, or environment variable usage are present. The code appears to be a standard utility for metric formatting with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for formatting metrics with optional tags and sample rate. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected. The code is safe and normal for its purpose.",
