  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports consistently state that the code is purely declarative, defining type aliases and enums for metrics and connection states, with no input/output, data processing, or suspicious behavior. They assign a security risk score of 0, malware score of 0, and obfuscated score of 0 across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The code appears straightforward and matches the descriptions: no dynamic code, no external data handling, no network or file operations.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious components are present.\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the code as purely declarative, with no security concerns.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are observed.\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores seem appropriate.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- The code is simple type and enum definitions, with no runtime behavior, data flow, or external dependencies.\n- **Conclusion:** Risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n### Step 5: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly assess the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores with the report\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- Given the code's nature, even a conservative approach would assign zero risk.\n- The code's purpose is purely structural, defining types and enums for use elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n- No further action or revision needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scoring and analysis are accurate and appropriate.",
