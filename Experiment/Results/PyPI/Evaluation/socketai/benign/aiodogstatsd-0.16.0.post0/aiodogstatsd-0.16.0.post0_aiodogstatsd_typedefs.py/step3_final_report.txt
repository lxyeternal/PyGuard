  "purpose": "Defines type aliases and enumerations for metrics and connection states used in a larger system.",
  "sources": "Type alias declarations and enum class definitions; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static definitions only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliases and enum classes with no dynamic code, external data handling, or network operations. It is a standard module for defining metric types and connection states, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and purpose support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static declaration of types and enums for metrics and connection states, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
