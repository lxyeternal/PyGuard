  "purpose": "Defines type aliases and enumerations for metric types and connection states used in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "No external data input; only type annotations, string constants, and enumeration definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines type aliases and enumerations for metric data types and connection states. It uses standard Python modules 'enum' and 'typing'. There are no functions, input handling, or external data processing. No potential data leaks, malicious backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, structural, and intended for data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module establishing type definitions and enums for a larger system. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
