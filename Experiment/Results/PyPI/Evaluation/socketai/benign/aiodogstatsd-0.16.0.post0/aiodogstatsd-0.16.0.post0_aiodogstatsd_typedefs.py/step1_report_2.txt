{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases and enumerations for metrics and connection states, likely for a monitoring or telemetry library.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external output, or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily static type and enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python type alias definitions and enum classes for metric types and connection states. It uses standard library modules (enum, typing) without dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of type definitions and enums for a telemetry or monitoring package. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present.",
