  "purpose": "Define type aliases and enumerations related to metrics and connection states for a monitoring or telemetry system.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines constants, type aliases, and enums with no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations or data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only establishes static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, uses standard Python constructs, and contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type alias definitions and enum classes for metric types and connection states. All components are static definitions with no input/output, no external dependencies or data handling, and no dynamic code execution. The structure appears standard for configuration or constants definition in a telemetry context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only static definitions for types and enums. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
