{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases and enumerations related to metrics, states, and data tagging for a monitoring or telemetry system.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only defines types and enums.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely declares types and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises type aliases for various metric data types and enum classes for metric types and connection states. It uses standard Python syntax, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. There are no input or output operations, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward declaration module for use elsewhere in a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, establishing types and enums without any malicious or suspicious components. It poses no security risks.",
