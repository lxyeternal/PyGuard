{
  "purpose": "Define data types, enumerations, and constants for metrics and connection states, likely for use in telemetry or monitoring.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read; the code defines type aliases and enums.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code appears standard for type and enum definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases for metric-related data and defines two enums for metric types and connection states. There are no input handling, no network operations, no data processing, or security-sensitive actions. No suspicious code patterns, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining types and enums for metrics and connection states without any malicious or security-risk components. It appears to be safe and intended for use in a larger system without malicious intent.",
