  "purpose": "Provides a factory function to obtain the current asyncio event loop, compatible with Python 3.7+ and earlier versions.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Calls to asyncio.get_running_loop or asyncio.get_event_loop, which are standard library functions.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> conditional check -> asyncio.get_running_loop or asyncio.get_event_loop",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard asyncio functions with version compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a factory function that returns the appropriate asyncio event loop getter based on Python version. It ensures compatibility across versions by choosing get_running_loop for Python 3.7+ and get_event_loop otherwise. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious data flows. The code solely interacts with the asyncio library for event loop management, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward compatibility utility for obtaining the asyncio event loop. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
