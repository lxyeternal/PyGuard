{
  "purpose": "Provides a compatibility layer for retrieving the asyncio event loop across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for version detection; asyncio.get_running_loop and asyncio.get_event_loop for obtaining event loops.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Determines Python version, then assigns the appropriate asyncio function to get_event_loop.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward logic with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version and assigns a function to get_event_loop accordingly, ensuring compatibility. It uses standard library functions without any external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The logic is simple, well-understood, and aligns with best practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
