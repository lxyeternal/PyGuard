  "purpose": "Provides a factory function to retrieve the current asyncio event loop based on Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version detection, asyncio.get_running_loop, asyncio.get_event_loop",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "The function _get_event_loop_factory uses sys.version_info to decide which asyncio function to return, then get_event_loop variable holds this function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code adapts to different Python versions for correct event loop retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the Python version to select the appropriate asyncio event loop function, ensuring compatibility across versions. It does not perform any network I/O, data manipulation, or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. It appears to be standard version compatibility handling for asyncio.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for retrieving the asyncio event loop in different Python versions. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
