  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward Python setup script. There are no indications of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, network operations, or any other suspicious behavior. The code solely defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters for packaging.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the script is static, declarative, and typical for a Python package setup. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign a score of 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the script.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is justified since there's no evidence of security vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n   These scores seem reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n   Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected, raising scores above 0.5 would be unjustified. The script is purely declarative configuration code with no security concerns.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They base their conclusions on static analysis, noting the absence of suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. They reflect the absence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- **Risk Score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a standard Python package setup script with no security issues. It is safe, benign, and typical for its purpose.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes to the scores are necessary. The code poses no security threat and is purely configuration data for packaging.",
