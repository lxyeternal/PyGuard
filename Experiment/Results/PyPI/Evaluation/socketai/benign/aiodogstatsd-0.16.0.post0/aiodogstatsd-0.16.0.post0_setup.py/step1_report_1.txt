{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'aiodogstatsd' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Static data in the script such as package lists, metadata, and configuration parameters; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or untrusted data effects observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration code without data flow or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It defines package lists, data, extras, and setup parameters with metadata such as name, version, description, author, URL, dependencies, and other configuration options. The code is purely declarative for packaging purposes. No code executes dynamically, no input/output streams, no external data sources, nor any potentially malicious code snippets. It does not include any hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated instructions. The content is typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup configuration with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It is safe and solely used for packaging the 'aiodogstatsd' library.",
