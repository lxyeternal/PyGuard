  "purpose": "Export the Client class for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Client from a local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code simply exports a class",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies observed; the code appears straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Client from a relative module, then exposes it via __all__ for module exports. There are no embedded data inputs, no execution logic, no variable manipulation, and no indications of malicious behavior. The code's simplicity suggests it is a standard module export pattern with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward import and export operation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
