  "purpose": "This code module imports a 'Client' class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a simple export interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .client module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import from .client to module namespace, no data flow beyond import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard for module exports",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and exposes it without any data processing, external input, or dynamic behavior. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 1,
