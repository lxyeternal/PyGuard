{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to expose the 'Client' class for external use via the module's namespace.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Client' from a local module '.client'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present; the code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet; the import is static, and the export is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple module file that imports a class 'Client' from a local module and exposes it publicly via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or dynamic execution. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module export code with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. It is a typical pattern for Python packages to re-export classes or functions.",
