  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific purpose cannot be clearly determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables and potentially from external files or network sources (not explicitly shown but implied by typical usage).",
  "sinks": "Writes data to standard output or logs; possibly involves network transmission or file operations (not explicitly shown).",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or external sources through processing functions to output or storage, but specific flow paths are not explicitly clear in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are evident. The code uses standard Python constructs without obfuscation or unconventional language features.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for typical malicious patterns, including suspicious data handling, unusual control flow, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity. No signs of such behaviors were found. The code uses common libraries and functions, with no embedded or hidden malicious intent apparent from the snippet. The absence of obfuscation or complex dynamic code execution further suggests it is benign. However, incomplete context limits full assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard utility code without malicious intent. Confidence in this conclusion is high, but full certainty cannot be achieved without additional context.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
