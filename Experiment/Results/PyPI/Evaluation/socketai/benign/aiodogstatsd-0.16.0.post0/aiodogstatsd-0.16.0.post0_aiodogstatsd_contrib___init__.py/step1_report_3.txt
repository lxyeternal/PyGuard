  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or communication, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Data might be sent over network sockets, written to files, or output to the console. Potential sinks include network communications, file writes, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Untrusted or external data from sources such as environment variables or input functions flows into processing functions, which may then output or transmit data via network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamically executed code (e.g., eval or exec), obfuscated variable names, or unnecessary dynamic imports could suggest suspicious behavior, but none are explicitly observed in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code analysis indicates standard data processing with no overtly suspicious functions or patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are detected. Overall, the code functions as a typical Python script without clear malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and aligns with normal application operations.",
