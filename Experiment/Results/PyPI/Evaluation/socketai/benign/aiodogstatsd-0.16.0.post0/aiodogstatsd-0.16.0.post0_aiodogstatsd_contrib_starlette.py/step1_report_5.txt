  "purpose": "Middleware for collecting HTTP request duration metrics and optionally tracking 404 and 405 responses in a Starlette application.",
  "sources": "Request data from 'request.method', 'request.scope', 'request.path'; response status from 'response.status_code'.",
  "sinks": "The 'timing' method of the 'aiodogstatsd.Client' object, which sends data over the network.",
  "flows": "Request data (method, path, response status) flows into the 'timing' method call for metrics reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No external data injections or insecure handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a middleware class that measures request durations and reports metrics via 'aiodogstatsd.Client'. It handles exceptions, derives route paths, and conditionally reports metrics based on response status. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The only external interaction is with the statsd client, which is used for legitimate metrics reporting. The code appears well-structured and standard for this purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended for metrics collection in a web app, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on external metrics service, which is typical and safe in this context.",
