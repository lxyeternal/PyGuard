  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse query strings from URLs into dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input URL strings provided to query_string() and parse() functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input URL strings are split and processed to extract query parameters, then passed to _parse_qs for parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no unusual behavior detected. Functions are standard URL parsing routines.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for extracting query parameters from URLs, using standard library functions with compatibility handling for different Python versions. The functions split the URL string, extract the query part, and parse it into a dictionary. No external data sources, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for parsing URL query strings, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and does not contain suspicious anomalies.",
