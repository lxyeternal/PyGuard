  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to parse URL query strings into dictionaries, extracting query parameters from URLs or strings.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'string' parameter in 'query_string' and 'parse' functions.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the input to produce a dictionary; it does not directly send data elsewhere or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input string -> URL parsing logic -> _parse_qs processing -> output dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No dynamic execution, no external network calls, no data leaks. The code performs straightforward parsing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'parse_qs' from either 'urlparse' or 'urllib.parse', which is standard for compatibility across Python versions. The '_parse_qs' function processes query string key-value pairs into a dictionary, simplifying values with single entries. The 'query_string' and 'parse' functions extract the query component from a URL or string, handling '?' and '#' characters. No untrusted data is executed, and no external communications or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The logic is simple and safe, focused solely on parsing URL query strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for parsing URL query strings without malicious intent. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
