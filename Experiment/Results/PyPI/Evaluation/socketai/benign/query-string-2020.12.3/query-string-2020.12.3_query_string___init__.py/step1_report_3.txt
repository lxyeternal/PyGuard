{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse query strings from URLs, extracting parameters into a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input is received through the 'string' parameter of the functions 'query_string' and 'parse', which are expected to be URL or query string inputs.",
  "sinks": "Data flow primarily involves parsing functions; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input string → processed in 'query_string' or 'parse' → passed to '_parse_qs' for dictionary conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code relies on standard library functions with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to parse URL query strings, extracting key-value pairs into a dictionary. It handles cases where the input string contains '?' and '#' characters to isolate the query component. The '_parse_qs' helper function simplifies the output from 'parse_qs' to a more convenient dictionary format, reducing nested list structures. The code uses standard library functions and performs straightforward string operations without any suspicious logic, external data flows, or dynamic code execution. No anomalies, malicious code, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for parsing URL query parameters with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation intended for URL query parsing, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities present.",
