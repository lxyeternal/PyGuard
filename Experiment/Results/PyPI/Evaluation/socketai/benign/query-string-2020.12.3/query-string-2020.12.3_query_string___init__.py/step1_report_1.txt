{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to parse URL query strings into dictionaries, supporting different Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments 'string' in 'query_string' and 'parse' functions, and from the URL string processed within those functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions process and return dictionaries; no data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed to extract query parameters, with the URL string being split on '?' and '#' characters to isolate the query component, then parsed into key-value pairs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. Functions rely on standard library functions. No malicious behaviors or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to extract query parameters from URLs or query strings, handling both Python 2 and 3 imports. It uses 'parse_qs' from the standard library, with no apparent malicious modifications or unsafe behaviors. No external network access, data leaks, or code injections are evident. The code appears straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard URL query string parsing with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe and functions as intended for extracting URL parameters.",
