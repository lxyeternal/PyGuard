  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to parse URL query strings into dictionaries, handling both Python 2 and 3 compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads input URL or string containing query parameters; uses standard library 'parse_qs' from urlparse or urllib.parse.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; purely processes input strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input string -> split on '?' and '#' -> pass to '_parse_qs' -> parse_qs output -> convert to dict with scalar values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard URL query parser that extracts and processes query parameters. It handles URL fragments and supports Python 2 and 3. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The functions are well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The use of 'parse_qs' and string splitting is safe and common. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. The code's benign nature is consistent across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for parsing URL query strings. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, reflecting its safe and standard implementation.",
