{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for parsing query strings from URLs, converting them into dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input is provided via the 'string' parameter in the 'query_string' and 'parse' functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any direct data sinks that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input string → parsing functions → output dictionary",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'parse_qs' from either 'urlparse' (Python 2) or 'urllib.parse' (Python 3). It defines a helper '_parse_qs' to process the parsed query string, converting list values to single values where appropriate. Both 'query_string' and 'parse' functions extract the query component from URLs, remove fragments, and parse the query string into dictionaries. The functions handle empty strings gracefully. There are no dynamic executions, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for URL query string parsing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes input strings and returns dictionaries, with proper handling of typical URL components. No malware or security issues are present.",
