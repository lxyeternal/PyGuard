  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'query-string', including reading dependencies from an external requirements file.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'requirements.txt' file using open() function",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data flows to insecure operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and passing them to install_requires during package setup",
  "anomalies": "The use of open() to read 'requirements.txt' without any validation or exception handling. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package setup, defines package metadata, and reads dependencies directly from 'requirements.txt'. The file reading is straightforward and standard for setup scripts, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No other code, external calls, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code functions as expected for package configuration.",
