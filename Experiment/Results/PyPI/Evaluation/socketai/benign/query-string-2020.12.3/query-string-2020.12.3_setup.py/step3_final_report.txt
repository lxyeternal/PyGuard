  "purpose": "Configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' file via open() to obtain dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data from 'requirements.txt' influencing dependency installation.",
  "flows": "Reads file content with open() -> passes dependencies list to install_requires.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without exception handling; no validation or sanitization of 'requirements.txt'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that loads dependencies from an external file without validation. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the lack of exception handling, which could cause runtime errors if 'requirements.txt' is missing or tampered with. The code's simplicity and reliance on external files do not suggest malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate, reflecting a minor robustness concern rather than a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python package setup, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary concern is external dependency integrity and lack of exception handling, which does not constitute a security risk. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
