  "purpose": "Setup configuration for Python package 'query-string', including reading dependencies from a file.",
  "sources": "Reading the requirements.txt file for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is used for sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt' during package setup; no further data flow to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read dependencies during setup is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package info. It reads dependencies dynamically from 'requirements.txt', which is a common practice but could potentially be manipulated if 'requirements.txt' is altered maliciously outside the code. No other suspicious code, obfuscated parts, or malicious patterns are present. The script performs standard setup tasks without executing untrusted code or performing network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard setup routine for a Python package with dynamic dependency loading. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified based on this code alone.",
