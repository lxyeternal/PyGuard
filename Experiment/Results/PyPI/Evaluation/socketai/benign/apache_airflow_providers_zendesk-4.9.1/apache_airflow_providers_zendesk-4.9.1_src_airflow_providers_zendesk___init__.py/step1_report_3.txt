{
  "purpose": "This code manages version compatibility checks for an Apache Airflow provider package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the installed Airflow version via the __version__ attribute imported from airflow.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input or data outputs.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading the airflow version to parsing it with packaging.version, then potentially raises a RuntimeError if version requirements are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and relies on standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a version string, and checks whether the installed Airflow version meets a minimum requirement. If not, it raises an error. The code appears to be a standard compatibility check without any malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate version check for package compatibility, with no signs of malicious behavior. It simply ensures that the environment meets the minimum version requirement.",
