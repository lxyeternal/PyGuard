{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an autogenerated Python module for a package, mainly responsible for version checks and licensing information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported modules (__future__, packaging.version, airflow.__version__) and the variable airflow_version.",
  "sinks": "The code raises an exception if the airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a control flow based on version comparison.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the airflow version, parses it, compares it to a minimum required version, and raises an exception if the requirement is not met.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious functions. The version check is standard for dependency compatibility enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly for metadata and dependency validation. It imports standard modules, retrieves version info, and enforces a minimum version requirement via a runtime check. No untrusted input sources, external network access, or malicious logic are present. The version parsing and comparison are straightforward and typical for package validation. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, autogenerated dependency check for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code’s purpose is to ensure compatibility and license info, with no indicators of malware or security threats.",
