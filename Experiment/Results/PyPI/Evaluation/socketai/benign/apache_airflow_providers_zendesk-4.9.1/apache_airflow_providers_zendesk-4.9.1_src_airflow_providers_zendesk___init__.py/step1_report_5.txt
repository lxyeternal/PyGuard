{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated initialization file for an Apache Airflow provider package, primarily setting version information and performing a version check for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads the imported package 'packaging.version' and the 'airflow.__version__' variable.",
  "sinks": "The version check raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0.",
  "flows": "Imports version data, compares the current Airflow version with a threshold, and potentially raises an exception based on the comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The version check is standard practice for ensuring compatibility. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines version info, and performs a straightforward comparison to enforce minimum required Airflow version. The version parsing and comparison are standard. No external data or untrusted input sources are used beyond the imported modules. No malicious or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated setup script with no malicious intent. It enforces version compatibility and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
