{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated module for an Apache Airflow provider, setting version information and performing a compatibility check.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via import (`airflow.__version__`) and a version string `__version__` defined within the file.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0; this is a controlled exception with no data leak or external effect.",
  "flows": "The airflow version is imported and parsed, then used in a comparison; if the condition is met, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for version checks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the necessary modules, retrieves the current airflow version, and compares it with a minimum required version (2.9.0). If the version is older, it raises a RuntimeError with a clear message. The code is minimal, well-structured, and performs a standard compatibility check. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check script for ensuring compatibility of a package with the Apache Airflow environment. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
