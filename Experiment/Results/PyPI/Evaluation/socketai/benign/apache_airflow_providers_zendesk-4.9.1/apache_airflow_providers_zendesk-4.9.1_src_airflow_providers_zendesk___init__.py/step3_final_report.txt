{
  "purpose": "The code performs a version check to ensure the installed Apache Airflow version meets the minimum required version (2.9.0). It raises an error if the version is too low, serving as a dependency validation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported 'airflow.__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or security effects; the code only raises an exception if the version requirement is not met.",
  "flows": "The source is the 'airflow.__version__' attribute; the flow leads to the version comparison and potential RuntimeError raise if the version is insufficient.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and performs a standard version check without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'packaging.version' and 'airflow.__version__', defines a version string, and compares the current Airflow version to a minimum required version ('2.9.0'). If the installed version is lower, it raises a RuntimeError. The code is auto-generated, with comments indicating its purpose for documentation and dependency validation. There are no untrusted inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The version comparison relies on trusted package attributes, and the code's purpose is to enforce dependency requirements. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency version check with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a straightforward validation to ensure compatibility, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
