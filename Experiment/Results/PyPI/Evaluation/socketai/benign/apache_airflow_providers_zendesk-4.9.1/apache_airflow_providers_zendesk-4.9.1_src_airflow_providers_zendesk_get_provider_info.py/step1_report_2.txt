{
  "purpose": "The code provides metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-zendesk' package, including version history, dependencies, and integration details.",
  "sources": "Data sources include static string definitions, list declarations, and dictionary assignments within the get_provider_info() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code is automatically generated and contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated content, or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a static Python function returning a dictionary with package metadata. It includes version lists, dependency specifications, and integration info, all hardcoded. The code lacks input handling, external data processing, or executable logic beyond returning static data. There are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward metadata definition for a Python package. It contains no malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard auto-generated file meant for documentation or package management purposes.",
