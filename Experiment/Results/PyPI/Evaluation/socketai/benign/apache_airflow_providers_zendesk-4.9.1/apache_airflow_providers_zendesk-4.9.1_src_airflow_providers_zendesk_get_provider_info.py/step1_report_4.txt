  "purpose": "Provide metadata and configuration information for the apache-airflow-providers-zendesk package.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data; it mainly returns static data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there is no data processing, storage, or transmission.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow as the code only returns static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and autogenerated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function returning a dictionary with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration info. It contains no external data reading, no user input, no network operations, or code execution. The structure and content are typical for package metadata files, especially those generated automatically. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, autogenerated metadata function with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely provides static package information.",
