  "sources": "Static data within the function returning a dictionary; no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output beyond returning static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; function simply returns predefined metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is a straightforward static data definition with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function that returns a dictionary containing package metadata, versions, dependencies, and integration info. There are no input sources, no untrusted data flows, and no sinks that could leak data or execute malicious actions. The code appears to be a generated configuration file with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All data is hardcoded, and there are no code injection points or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, static metadata provider with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It is a generated configuration file intended for package metadata, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
