  "flows": "The function simply returns a predefined dictionary; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python function returning a fixed dictionary with package info. It contains no dynamic behavior, external input, network operations, or obfuscation. The code is clearly auto-generated with standard licensing headers. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. The code's purpose is purely informational, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration provider with no malicious or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
