  "purpose": "This code is a standard license header comment from the Apache Software Foundation, serving as legal licensing information.",
  "sources": "The comment block itself, which contains no code or data input points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no executable code or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist due to the absence of code logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the content is purely a license comment.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a non-executable license header comment, containing only licensing text. There are no data inputs, outputs, or code flows. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the content. The high confidence scores are justified, and no anomalies or risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a license header comment. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are accurate and consistent with the content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
