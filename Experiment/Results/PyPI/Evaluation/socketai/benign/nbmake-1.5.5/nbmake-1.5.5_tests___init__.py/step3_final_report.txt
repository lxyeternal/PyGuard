  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, network communication points, file I/O, environment variables, hardcoded secrets, code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, external API calls, system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, network requests, or environment reads, indicating potential malicious data exfiltration or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious external domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, incomplete or missing code, inconsistent or overly cautious risk scores.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code, with benign descriptions. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and risk scores are low (0.2 or below). Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. No suspicious patterns, external connections, or obfuscation are detected. The assessments are internally consistent and justified. Slight adjustments to risk scores (e.g., lowering from 0.2 to 0.1) could improve consistency, but current scores are acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, and the assessments are justified based on the provided descriptions. No significant revisions are necessary.",
