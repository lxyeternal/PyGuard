{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided due to the absence of code content; likely intended for general use or as part of a package.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly identified; no user input, environment variables, or external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable within the code, indicating no data propagation paths of concern.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual language features, obfuscated segments, hardcoded secrets, or atypical constructs. The absence of code makes analysis difficult but does not raise suspicion.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of any code, the analysis concludes that there are no observable sources, sinks, or flows, and no anomalies are detected. This suggests either empty or non-functional code, which by itself poses no security threat. The lack of content limits the ability to identify malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided empty or non-present code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign or non-existent, with no detectable data leaks or malicious activity.",
