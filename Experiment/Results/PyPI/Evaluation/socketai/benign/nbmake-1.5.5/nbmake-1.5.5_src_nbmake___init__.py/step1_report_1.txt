{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly intended for data processing or utility purposes, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read external data or user input explicitly.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections or file writes if present, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow identified; the code executes internal logic without external data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution are observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain visible malicious behavior. It uses standard Python constructs, libraries, and straightforward logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. Without additional context or external dependencies, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose with no obvious supply chain threats.",
