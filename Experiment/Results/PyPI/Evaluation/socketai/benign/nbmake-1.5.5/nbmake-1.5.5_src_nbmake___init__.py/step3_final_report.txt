  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input from untrusted sources such as environment variables, user input, external files, network data; potential use of eval/exec or subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Sensitive operations like network communication, file access, subprocess execution, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (untrusted input) to sinks (e.g., eval/exec, network transmission, file writing).",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution (eval/exec), unvalidated external input, obfuscation, or unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no malicious indicators, assigning low malware and risk scores. Report 4 suggests potential dynamic code execution and untrusted input handling, justifying moderate suspicion scores. The scores are consistent with the descriptions; no concrete code snippets are provided for definitive confirmation. The overall pattern indicates low likelihood of malicious activity, with a cautious note on suspicious patterns in report 4.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears largely benign with minimal obfuscation or malicious intent. The moderate suspicion in report 4 warrants a slightly elevated malware and risk score. Overall, the code is considered low risk, but monitoring for dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling is advised.",
