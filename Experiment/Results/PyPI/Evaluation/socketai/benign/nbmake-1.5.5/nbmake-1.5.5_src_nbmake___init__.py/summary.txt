  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears largely benign with minimal obfuscation or malicious intent. The moderate suspicion in report 4 warrants a slightly elevated malware and risk score. Overall, the code is considered low risk, but monitoring for dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling is advised."
