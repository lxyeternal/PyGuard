  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for general data processing or utility functions, but without specific comments or context, its precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, files, or user input functions such as input(), though these are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file operations, or system calls, but no explicit actions are identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as inputs or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like output or network operations, which are not detailed here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are detected. The code uses standard Python features and libraries without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any obvious malicious or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network connections, or hardcoded secrets. The overall structure is typical for a utility or processing script, and no anomalies stand out. Without further context or external calls, the security risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears to be benign, but the lack of context limits definitive assessment. No security risks are identified at this stage.",
