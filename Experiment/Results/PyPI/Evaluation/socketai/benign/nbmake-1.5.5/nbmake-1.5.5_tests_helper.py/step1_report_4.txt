{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions to create Jupyter notebooks with specified code cells and metadata, and a fixture to set environment variables for testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variable access (os.environ['HOME']), input data (list of code strings in 'passing_nb' and 'failing_nb')",
  "sinks": "File write operation (write to notebook file), environment variable usage, importing modules, and potential code execution via code cells",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'HOME' is read, code strings are added to notebook cells, and the notebook is written to disk; no dynamic code execution or network activity occurs directly",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Use of environment variables is standard. Code is straightforward and primarily for test setup.",
  "analysis": "The script creates Jupyter notebooks with predefined code cells for testing purposes, explicitly importing modules, defining variables, and raising exceptions. The environment variable 'HOME' is read and reset in a fixture to ensure proper test environment setup. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs file writing and environment setup in a standard manner, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test setup script for creating notebooks and setting environment variables. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
