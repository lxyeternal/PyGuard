The observed error formatting and file handling are typical and safe. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to error formatting features."

      "conclusion": "While the code does not contain embedded malware or obfuscation, its capability to execute arbitrary code from notebook metadata presents a significant security risk if the input is untrusted. The current low malware scores are not fully representative of this potential threat. Therefore, the malware score should be increased to 0.6, and the overall security risk to 0.7 to accurately reflect the vulnerability."

It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current scores of zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are accurate and justified."
