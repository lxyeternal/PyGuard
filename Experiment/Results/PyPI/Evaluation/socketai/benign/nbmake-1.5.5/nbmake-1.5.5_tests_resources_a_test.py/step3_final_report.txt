  "purpose": "A trivial test function asserting True, serving as a placeholder or unit test.",
  "sources": "No data inputs, external calls, or data reading; static code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code performs a simple assertion.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, minimal code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function 'test_x()' that asserts True, with no inputs, outputs, or side effects. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is a standard placeholder/test stub, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
