{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the NotebookRun class, executing various notebooks to verify behavior under different scenarios such as passing, failing, timeouts, and errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads notebooks from resource files or creates them programmatically, including filesystem operations like writing and reading notebooks.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows or network activity; execution is confined to local filesystem and in-memory notebook processing.",
  "flows": "Read notebooks from files/resources, execute via NotebookRun, and assert on the results and errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard testing practices are used. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled execution of predefined notebooks, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The execution environment is local and trusted. The notebooks themselves are resource files, not user input, minimizing risk. No network activity or data exfiltration is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature and environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe test suite for notebook execution with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
