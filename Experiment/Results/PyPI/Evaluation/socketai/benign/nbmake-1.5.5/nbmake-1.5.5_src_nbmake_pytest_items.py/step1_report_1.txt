{
  "purpose": "The code is part of a pytest plugin that runs Jupyter notebooks, captures errors, and formats test reports.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the file system (notebook files), and from exception objects during error handling.",
  "sinks": "Uses `traceback.format_tb` and `highlight` for formatting errors, but no data is sent over the network or written to external sources.",
  "flows": "Exception data flows from caught exceptions to formatted output for reporting, with no external data leakage or system modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual code behaviors or obfuscation detected. Uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numerous standard and third-party modules for file handling, formatting, and testing. It defines classes to handle test item collection, execution, and error reporting within pytest. Error handling involves formatting traceback information and highlighting syntax for terminal output, which is safe. No network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident. The code interacts solely with local files and exception objects, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pytest plugin for notebook testing and error reporting. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. Its security risk score is very low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
