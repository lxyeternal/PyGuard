  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pytest extension for running notebooks and reporting errors. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The observed error formatting and file handling are typical and safe. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk due to error formatting features."
