  "purpose": "Provides pytest configuration and collection logic for notebook testing, including command-line options and environment-based behaviors.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input via pytest options, system info (sys.version_info), file paths.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for reporting, environment variables influencing output, no external network or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and pytest options influence printed output and test collection behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest plugin setup for notebook testing, utilizing common libraries and practices. It conditionally sets event loop policies, adds command-line options, and defines file collection logic based on file paths and user options. The reporting function outputs messages based on environment variables, typical for CI/CD integrations. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, benign, and intended for test automation. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
