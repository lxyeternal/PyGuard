  "conclusion": "While the code does not contain embedded malware or obfuscation, its capability to execute arbitrary code from notebook metadata presents a significant security risk if the input is untrusted. The current low malware scores are not fully representative of this potential threat. Therefore, the malware score should be increased to 0.6, and the overall security risk to 0.7 to accurately reflect the vulnerability."
