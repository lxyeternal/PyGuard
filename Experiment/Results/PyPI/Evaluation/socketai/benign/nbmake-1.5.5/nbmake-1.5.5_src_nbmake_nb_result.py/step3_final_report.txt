{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes for representing notebook errors and results, serving as structural components in a notebook processing system.",
  "sources": "Import of standard libraries (`dataclasses`, `typing`) and `nbformat` for handling notebook data structures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present; code is purely structural.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic; static class definitions with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with clear class definitions and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two data class definitions, `NotebookError` and `NotebookResult`, which are simple containers for error information and notebook data. It imports standard libraries and `nbformat`, a common package for notebook manipulation. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing. The code is static and purely structural, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The import of `nbformat` does not imply malicious intent; it is used for handling notebook data structures. The absence of external data handling, network activity, or executable logic indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of data classes for error reporting in notebook processing. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current scores of zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are accurate and justified.",
