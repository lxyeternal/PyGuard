{
  "purpose": "Define data classes for handling notebook errors and results in a notebook processing system.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard library modules and the 'nbformat' library; class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data output, network calls, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into class attributes; no data manipulation or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two data classes, 'NotebookError' and 'NotebookResult', which are straightforward data containers. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling beyond static class attributes, and no external communications or data leaks. The import of 'nbformat' indicates usage related to Jupyter notebooks but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears standard and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data structure definition for handling notebook errors and results. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
