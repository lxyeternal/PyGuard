  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of data class definitions (`NotebookError` and `NotebookResult`) with no executable logic, data processing, or external data handling. The code is static and purely structural.\n\n2. **Malicious Patterns & Anomalies:**  \n   None of the reports find any suspicious or malicious behavior—no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity. This aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**  \n   The reports correctly challenge any assumptions about malicious intent, confirming that the code does not process untrusted data or perform any risky operations.\n\n5. **Consistency & Justification:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the straightforward, non-executable, and non-malicious characteristics of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n  No malicious behavior, no code injection, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n  The code is clear, straightforward, and uses standard Python constructs.\n\n- **Risk Score:** **0**  \n  No security risks are present in this static data structure definition.\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, standard implementation of data classes for error reporting in a notebook processing system. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0**  \n\nAll scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and clarity.",
