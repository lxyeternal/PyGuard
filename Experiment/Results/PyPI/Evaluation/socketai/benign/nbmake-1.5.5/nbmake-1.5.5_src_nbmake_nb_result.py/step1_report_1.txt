{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes for handling notebook errors and results, facilitating structured error reporting for notebooks.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dataclasses', 'typing', and 'nbformat' modules; no external or user input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output operations observed; code does not process or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely structural code defining data containers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes: 'NotebookError' and 'NotebookResult'. These classes contain only static fields with no executable logic, no data processing, no external data reads, or network operations. No malicious patterns are present. It appears to be a utility module for error handling within a larger notebook processing system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical data structure definition with no suspicious characteristics.",
