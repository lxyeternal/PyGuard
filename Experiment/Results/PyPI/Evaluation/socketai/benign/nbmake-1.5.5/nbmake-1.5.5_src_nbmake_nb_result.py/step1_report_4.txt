  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling notebook errors and results.",
  "sources": "Import statements from dataclasses, typing, and nbformat modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "None; data structures are static definitions without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python data class definitions for encapsulating notebook error information and results. It imports standard and external modules, but does not perform any data processing, I/O operations, or execute dynamic code. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of type hints and annotations appears conventional, serving as a clean, structured approach to handle notebook metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining data containers without executable or network actions. It poses no security threat or malicious intent based on the provided snippet.",
