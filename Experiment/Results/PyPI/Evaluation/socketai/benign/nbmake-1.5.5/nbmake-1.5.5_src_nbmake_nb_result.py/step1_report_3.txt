{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling notebook errors and results in a Python environment, likely for processing or analyzing notebooks.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and nbformat modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines data classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; straightforward use of dataclass and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for data classes and type hints, and a specific class from nbformat. It defines two simple data classes for representing notebook errors and results, with fields for summary, trace, cell index, and the notebook object itself. There are no input handling, external data processing, or dynamic behaviors; it appears to be a standard, clean definition of data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign definition of data containers with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, connect externally, or include obfuscated code.",
