  "purpose": "Define data structures for representing notebook errors and results.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading points in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two dataclass definitions: NotebookError and NotebookResult, which structure error information and results for notebook processing. There are no input/output operations, external calls, or data manipulation. The imported modules are standard and used solely for defining data containers. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, serving as data containers without executing any logic, data handling, or external interactions. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
