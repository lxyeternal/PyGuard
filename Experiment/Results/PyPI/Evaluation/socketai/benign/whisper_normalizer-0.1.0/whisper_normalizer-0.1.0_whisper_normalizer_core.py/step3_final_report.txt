  "purpose": "A minimal, auto-generated Python module defining an export list and an empty function.",
  "sources": "The list '__all__' and the function 'foo()' are defined; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code contains only static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple placeholder module with a list of exports and an empty function. It contains no external I/O, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious elements support these conclusions. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated boilerplate with no security risks or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
