  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library, configuring metadata and dependencies based on external configuration files.",
  "sources": "Reads 'settings.ini' for configuration parameters, reads 'README.md' for long description, uses 'pkg_resources' and 'setuptools' modules for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, code execution, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from external files ('settings.ini', 'README.md') into setup parameters; no malicious or suspicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external files without validation could be a minor concern, but no malicious or obfuscated code present; 'assert' statements are standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script that reads configuration from external files and invokes setuptools.setup() with the parameters. It performs version checks, validates presence of expected keys, and constructs the setup configuration accordingly. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. External files ('settings.ini', 'README.md') are standard in packaging workflows but could be tampered with outside the code's scope. The code does not execute untrusted code or perform insecure operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. External configuration reliance is typical and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2 due to external file reliance, which is acceptable in this context.",
