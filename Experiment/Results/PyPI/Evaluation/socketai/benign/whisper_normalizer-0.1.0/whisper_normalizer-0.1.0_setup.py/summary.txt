  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. External configuration reliance is typical and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2 due to external file reliance, which is acceptable in this context."
