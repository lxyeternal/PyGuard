  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior detected; standard setup script. The only potential concern is 'dependency_links', which can introduce external code, but this is common practice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup script, reading configuration and README. Minor concern about reading files without validation, but typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk due to external file reliance but still no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard package setup with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous; external files could be tampered with, but no malicious code present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk due to external file reliance, but no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup, no malicious behavior, configuration-driven.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and there's no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code is a typical setup script relying on external configuration files.\n  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on external files ('settings.ini', 'README.md') which could be tampered with, a small security risk (0.2) is justified. No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Confidence:** High (mostly 0.9 or 1), as the analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected; the code is a standard setup script.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — External files could be tampered with, but this is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a conventional Python package setup script with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security concern relates to external file reliance, which is common in packaging workflows but should be noted in security assessments.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.2**\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed risk analysis or further insights.",
