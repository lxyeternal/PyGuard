  "purpose": "Unicode normalization and script-specific adjustments for Indic scripts, including character replacements, decompositions, and digit-to-word conversions.",
  "sources": "String inputs from text data; regex patterns for script-specific character corrections.",
  "sinks": "Local string modifications; no external data transmission or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input text → normalization functions → string replacements and regex substitutions → output normalized text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; print statements in debugging functions are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward Unicode normalization tasks, including replacing composite characters, handling script-specific characters, and converting digits to words via an external utility. No network, file, or system command execution is present. The external dependency 'num_to_word' appears benign. Debug print statements are for internal diagnostics and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Unicode normalizer for Indic scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
