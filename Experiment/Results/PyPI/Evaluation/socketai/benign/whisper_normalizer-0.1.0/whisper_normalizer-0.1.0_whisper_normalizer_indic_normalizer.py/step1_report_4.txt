{
  "purpose": "This code provides normalization functions for various Indic scripts, standardizing Unicode representations, decomposing composite characters, and replacing specific characters with canonical forms to facilitate text processing in multiple Indic languages.",
  "sources": "Reads input text for normalization, digit sequences for conversion, and script-specific character manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the input text by replacing characters, decomposing characters, and inserting unicode symbols; no data is sent externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input text → normalization functions (e.g., replace, decompose, remap) → normalized text; digit parts are replaced with word forms; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `num_to_word` for converting digit sequences into words suggests text manipulation but not malicious; no hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are evident; no obfuscated code, uncommon language features, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on Unicode normalization, character decompositions, and language-specific text corrections. It replaces composite characters with their decomposed forms, normalizes script-specific characters, and converts digits to words for certain languages. All operations are local text modifications without external data fetching or network communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or covert channels. The functions are designed solely for linguistic normalization and script standardization, aligning with their intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and strictly focused on text normalization for Indic scripts. There are no indications of malware, malicious intent, or security risks within this module. The code performs standard Unicode normalization and script-specific adjustments without external dependencies or side effects.",
