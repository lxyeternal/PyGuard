  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, logical consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code normalizes Indic scripts, performing character replacements, decompositions, and script-specific adjustments. No external network or system access is evident.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the string manipulation focus. The external dependency `num_to_word` is benign if it's a standard number-to-word converter, which appears to be the case.\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk:** All scores are zero or very low, aligning with the code's behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the normalization of Unicode characters, script-specific replacements, and digit conversion.\n- **Assessment:** No external or system-level operations are present. The focus remains on string transformations.\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk:** Zero malware, obfuscation, and very low security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the string manipulation nature, with some mention of print statements in `get_char_stats`.\n- **Assessment:** The print statements are benign debugging aids, not malicious. No external activity.\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk:** All scores are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, intended for normalization.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing local string operations.\n- **Assessment:** No external data leaks or malicious patterns. The `num_to_word` dependency is benign.\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk:** Zero malware, obfuscation, and negligible security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard normalization utility.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, focusing on Unicode normalization, character replacements, and no external communication.\n- **Assessment:** The operations are straightforward string replacements and regex corrections.\n- **Malware / Obfuscated / Risk:** All scores are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code performs string manipulations, character replacements, and script-specific adjustments. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, given the benign nature of operations.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated:** **0**  \n**Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** (slightly above zero due to external dependencies and debugging print statements, but overall very low)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a well-structured, standard Unicode normalization suite for Indic scripts. It performs character replacements, decompositions, and script-specific adjustments, all within local string processing. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.",
