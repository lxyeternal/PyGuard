  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code details, the context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:** The code normalizes Indic scripts, performing character replacements, decompositions, and script-specific adjustments. No network or system commands are involved. The external `num_to_word` function is used for digit conversion, but its implementation is not suspicious.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly identifies that all operations are string manipulations, with no network or system calls.  \n- Usage of `num_to_word` is benign, assuming it's a standard utility.  \n- No obfuscation or hidden code detected.  \n- The risk score of 0.2 is conservative, reflecting minimal concern over potential misuse of `num_to_word`.  \n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard Unicode normalization, character replacements, and digit-to-word conversion. No external system activity or malicious behavior.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is purely text normalization, with no network, file, or system commands.  \n- The use of `num_to_word` is benign.  \n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.  \n- The risk score of 0 aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:** Again, the code performs Unicode normalization, character replacements, and digit conversion, with no external data leaks or system modifications. Presence of print statements in debugging functions is noted but not malicious.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The print statements are for debugging, not malicious.  \n- No network activity or code obfuscation.  \n- The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct assessment. No changes.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:** Focuses on Unicode normalization, character replacements, and digit-to-word conversion, with no external communication or malicious activity.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is strictly for text normalization.  \n- No external data or system interaction.  \n- The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing local string manipulations, character replacements, and script-specific corrections. No external data or malicious behavior.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The operations are all string manipulations, with no external effects.  \n- The use of `num_to_word` is benign.  \n- The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n- All reports correctly identify that the code performs Unicode normalization and script-specific text processing through string replacements and regex substitutions.  \n- No evidence of network activity, system command execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.  \n- The external dependency `num_to_word` is used for digit-to-word conversion, which is typical for such normalization tasks.  \n- The print statements in debugging functions are benign and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- **Malware scores:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** Should stay at 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, a maximum of 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, but since the reports already reflect low scores, no change is necessary.\n\n### My Overall Estimate\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and conservative. The code is a standard Unicode normalization utility for Indic scripts, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
