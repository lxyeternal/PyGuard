  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes normalization of Indic scripts, primarily string replacements, regex substitutions, and script-specific adjustments.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Only string manipulations, no external system/network access.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; external dependency `num_to_word` is used for digit conversion, but its implementation isn't suspicious. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard text normalizer for Indic scripts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The code is safe, purpose-specific, and only manipulates text.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, normalizing Indic scripts, converting digits, handling Unicode characters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String manipulations, no external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; `num_to_word` again used benignly.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard normalization utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns; consistent with Report 1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—Unicode normalization, script-specific character handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String modifications only.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; print statements in `get_char_stats` are benign debugging aids.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, focused on text normalization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior; just debugging output.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Unicode normalization, character replacements, digit to word conversion.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String processing only.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code; external `num_to_word` is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Normalization code, safe and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar normalization tasks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String manipulations, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; straightforward logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, intended for text normalization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe code that performs Unicode normalization, character replacements, and script-specific adjustments for Indic scripts.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected across all reports. No network, file, or system command execution.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only external dependency is `num_to_word`, which appears to be a utility for digit-to-word conversion. Unless this module is malicious or compromised (which isn't indicated), it poses no risk.\n- **Scores justification:** All malware scores are zero or very low (0.1 at worst), aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — the code performs only Unicode normalization and string replacements, with no external system interactions.\n\n**Note:** The only minor point is the print statements in `get_char_stats`, which are benign but could expose internal state if called with sensitive data. This does not constitute a security risk but is worth noting for production code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe entire set of reports and code snippets indicates a safe, well-structured Unicode normalization utility for Indic scripts, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
