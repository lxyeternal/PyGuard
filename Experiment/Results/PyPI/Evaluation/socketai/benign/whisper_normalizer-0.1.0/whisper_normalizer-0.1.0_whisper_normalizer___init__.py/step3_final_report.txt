  "flows": "No data flow; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration with no input, output, or data processing. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, no external data flows, and no anomalies. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
