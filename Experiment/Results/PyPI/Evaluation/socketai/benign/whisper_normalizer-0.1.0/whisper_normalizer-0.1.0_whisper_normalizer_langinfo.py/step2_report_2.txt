  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is for processing Indic scripts, character classification, and conversions. No external or network calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Functions like `get_offset` and `offset_to_char` perform character transformations based on Unicode code points. These are deterministic and straightforward.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Commented-out code appears incomplete but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** The malware and obfuscated scores are reasonable. The code is purely utility for script analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—utility functions for Indic scripts, Unicode ranges, and character classification.\n- **Analysis:** No external data, no network, no suspicious logic. Functions are simple range checks and lookups.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is safe, with a confidence of 1. Malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, character classification for Indic scripts, Unicode ranges, and linguistic utilities.\n- **Analysis:** No external dependencies or malicious behavior. Functions are straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identified as benign, with full confidence. Malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions for Indic script processing.\n- **Analysis:** No external or network activity. Functions are deterministic and safe.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate assessment as benign, with high confidence. Malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for Indic scripts, character classification.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, external data, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is safe, with full confidence. Malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is purely linguistic and utility-based.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, well-commented code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.2 or 0), appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, since the code is purely utility functions with no security implications)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code is a benign utility module for Indic script processing with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
