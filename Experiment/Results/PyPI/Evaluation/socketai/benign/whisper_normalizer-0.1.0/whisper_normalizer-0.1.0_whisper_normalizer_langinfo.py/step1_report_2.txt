{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants, ranges, and utility functions for handling Indic scripts, primarily for linguistic or script processing tasks such as character classification, script range validation, and character offset conversions.",
  "sources": "Reading input characters and their Unicode code points via functions like get_offset(c, lang) and offset_to_char(c, lang).",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions and classification functions that process Unicode code points and characters, including character classification, range checks, and conversions.",
  "flows": "Input characters are passed to functions like get_offset to determine character properties; offsets are used to classify characters and convert between character and code point representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. All functions perform standard Unicode and script-related operations. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow. The functions are straightforward and focus solely on Unicode range checks and character classification.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly provides utility functions and constants for handling Indic scripts and related Unicode ranges. The functions are designed for linguistic processing, such as identifying vowels, consonants, script-specific characters, and their properties. All functions are consistent with standard Unicode handling and script processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code appears safe, intended for linguistic or script analysis purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe utility module for Indic script processing, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs character classification and conversion based on Unicode ranges and script-specific offsets. No malicious patterns or security risks are detected.",
