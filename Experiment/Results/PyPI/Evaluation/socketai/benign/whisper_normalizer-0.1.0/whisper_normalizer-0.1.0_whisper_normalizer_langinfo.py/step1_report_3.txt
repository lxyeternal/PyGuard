{
  "purpose": "The code defines character ranges, utilities, and checks for Indic scripts and related languages, including functions to identify character types and properties for linguistic processing.",
  "sources": "Constants defining Unicode ranges and lists, functions that read character codes and offsets, and methods that evaluate character properties based on input characters.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data are present; functions mainly perform character classification and range checks without side effects or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input characters are processed through functions like get_offset() and is_*(), which evaluate their properties based on predefined ranges and lists.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. All functions are purely linguistic utilities. Commented-out code suggests potential for further development but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on character classification for Indic scripts, including Unicode range checks and specific character property functions. All operations are straightforward lookups or range checks with no external data access or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious logic. The functions are self-contained and perform linguistic validation based on Unicode code points, consistent with language processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for language and script classification with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely linguistic and Unicode-range based, with no suspicious activities.",
