  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code, the nature of the functions, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a benign utility for Indic script processing, with no signs of malicious intent. It correctly identifies that functions like `get_offset` and `offset_to_char` perform straightforward Unicode manipulations based on script ranges. The confidence score is high (0.9), and malware risk is low (0).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code primarily performs character classification, range checks, and conversions. No network, file, or system calls are present. The functions are deterministic and domain-specific, serving linguistic purposes.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's content. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code handles Unicode ranges and character classification for Indic scripts. It notes the absence of external data access or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are simple, range-based checks and conversions, with no external dependencies or side effects.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. The code is safe and purely linguistic.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a utility for script classification, with no external data handling or suspicious activity. The functions are straightforward Unicode range checks.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct conclusion; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on character classification functions, with no external data flow or malicious behavior. It notes the absence of I/O or network operations.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a collection of utility functions for linguistic processing, not security-sensitive operations.\n\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; no malware or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that the code is a utility for Indic script analysis, with no external interactions or malicious patterns. It emphasizes the deterministic nature of the functions.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is safe, with functions operating solely on Unicode code points.\n\n- **Verdict:** The conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a static utility module for script analysis, with no evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports agree on the absence of malicious behavior and obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the code does not perform external operations or handle untrusted data beyond Unicode character processing.\n\n- **Scores:** The given scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2 or 0) are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0**, given the code is straightforward and well-commented.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's domain-specific, safe nature, a score of **0** is appropriate. The minor risk score of 0.2 in the first report might be slightly overstated; it can be adjusted to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured utility module for Indic script processing. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores in the reports are consistent with the code's content, and I agree with the assessments provided.\n\n**Estimated final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms the code's safety and benign purpose.",
