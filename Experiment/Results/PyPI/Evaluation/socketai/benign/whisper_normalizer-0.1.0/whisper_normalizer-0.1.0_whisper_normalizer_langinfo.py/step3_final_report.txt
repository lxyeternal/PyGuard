{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for Indic script processing, including Unicode range checks, character classification, and conversions based on script-specific offsets.",
  "sources": "Functions like get_offset and offset_to_char read character code points; classification functions read Unicode code points and offsets.",
  "sinks": "No external data or system calls; functions operate solely on Unicode code points and offsets, with no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input characters are processed through get_offset, then classified or converted via functions like is_consonant, is_velar, or offset_to_char, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code suggests incomplete features but no malicious or obfuscated code; functions are straightforward and deterministic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of deterministic, domain-specific utilities for Unicode character classification in Indic scripts. It performs range checks and conversions based on Unicode code points and script-specific offsets. No external dependencies, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The functions are well-structured, with clear comments, and serve a linguistic processing purpose. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The code's operations are safe, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, domain-specific utility module for Indic script processing. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and appropriate.",
