{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and constants for identifying and manipulating characters and ranges related to Indic scripts, including classification of consonants, vowels, and script-specific offsets.",
  "sources": "Reads character data through functions like get_offset(c, lang) and direct use of ord(c), as well as predefined character ranges and lists.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present; functions operate solely on input characters or offsets without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Functions process input characters to determine properties (e.g., is_vowel, is_consonant) based on offsets or character codes, without external data flow or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The functions are straightforward character classifications. Commented-out code does not indicate malicious intent but suggests incomplete implementation or legacy code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for Indic script character ranges and lists of phonetic classes. Functions compute offsets and classify characters based on their code points, primarily for script processing. There are no external I/O, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The functions are deterministic and do not exhibit malicious behavior. The presence of extensive character classification and range checks suggests a focus on linguistic processing, not security or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard linguistic utility for Indic script processing, with no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior. It is purely computational with no external or hidden operations.",
