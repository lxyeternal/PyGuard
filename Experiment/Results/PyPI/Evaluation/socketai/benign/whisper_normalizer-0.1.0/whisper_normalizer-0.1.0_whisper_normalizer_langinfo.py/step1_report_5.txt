{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and constants for processing Indic scripts, such as checking character types and script ranges, to aid in language and script analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is read from Unicode character codes and string inputs representing characters and language identifiers.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network communication, or external system interactions. It primarily processes character codes internally.",
  "flows": "Input characters are mapped to offsets via get_offset(), and various functions evaluate character properties based on these offsets. No external data or untrusted input flows into critical system functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are evident. All functions are straightforward utility checks without hidden or misleading logic. The code is mostly commented out for some functions, indicating potential future use or optional features, but nothing malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for language and script ranges, including Unicode ranges for Indic and Urdu scripts. It provides functions to determine character properties such as being a vowel, consonant, nasal, etc., based on their Unicode offsets. The functions are consistent, simple, and safe. There are no code injection mechanisms, external data manipulation, or network interactions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a utility module intended for linguistic processing with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility library for Indic script analysis, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely on Unicode code points and provides property checks for language processing purposes.",
