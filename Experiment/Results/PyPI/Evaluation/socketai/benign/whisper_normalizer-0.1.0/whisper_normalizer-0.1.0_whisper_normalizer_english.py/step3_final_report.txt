{
  "purpose": "The code performs text normalization for English, including number conversion, spelling correction, and symbol removal, primarily through regex substitutions and resource loading for spelling mappings.",
  "sources": "Reads from an external JSON resource ('english.json') for spelling normalization; processes input strings via regex and string operations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or file writes; internal regex substitutions and resource access only.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex cleaning and normalization -> JSON resource for spelling correction -> final cleaned string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; resource loading is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured text normalization utility. It loads a JSON for spelling corrections, applies regex-based cleaning, and performs number and symbol normalization. No external network activity or malicious behavior is present. The resource loading is from a package resource, which is typical for such modules. The regex patterns and string manipulations are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign text normalization module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The resource dependency is standard and does not pose a security concern. The reports are accurate and justified.",
