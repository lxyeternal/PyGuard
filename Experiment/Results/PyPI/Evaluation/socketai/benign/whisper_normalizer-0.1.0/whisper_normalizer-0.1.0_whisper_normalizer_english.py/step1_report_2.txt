{
  "purpose": "To normalize and standardize English text, including number conversion, spelling normalization, and cleaning of unwanted characters or phrases.",
  "sources": "Uses imported modules such as 'json', 'os', 're', and 'importlib.resources.files'. Reads a JSON file ('english.json') from package resources for spelling mappings.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no network operations, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input string passes through regex-based cleaning, normalization, and transformation steps. External resource (JSON) is read during initialization to load spelling mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed. Uses standard libraries and well-defined resource files. No suspicious pattern or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs text normalization tasks such as removing brackets and parentheses, replacing contractions, normalizing spellings, and converting numbers. It reads a JSON file for spelling mappings, which is a standard resource loading method. All regex operations are straightforward text substitutions. No network activity, dynamic execution, or data exfiltration is evident. The resource file is accessed in a safe manner via package resources. The code operates solely on provided string input, with no external inputs or outputs that could be malicious. Overall, the code is well-structured for its purpose and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured text normalization module with no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It securely loads resources, performs standard text processing, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
