{
  "purpose": "The code provides text normalization and standardization functions for English, including number normalization, spelling normalization, and overall text cleanup, primarily for speech recognition or NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "File reading for the JSON spelling mappings; no external input reading or data acquisition present in the code.",
  "sinks": "None identified that handle untrusted data sources or could lead to data leakage or external effects.",
  "flows": "The code processes input strings through regex substitutions, internal mappings, and transformations, but all data flows are confined within the functions without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; the code uses standard libraries and straightforward processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs text normalization tasks with regex substitutions, dictionary lookups, and number conversions. It reads a JSON file for spelling mappings but does not involve network or file write operations, only read access during initialization. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or other suspicious activities are present. The code appears to be a benign utility module designed for text preprocessing, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign text normalization utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only reads a JSON file for spelling mappings and performs internal string transformations without external data flows or code injection mechanisms.",
