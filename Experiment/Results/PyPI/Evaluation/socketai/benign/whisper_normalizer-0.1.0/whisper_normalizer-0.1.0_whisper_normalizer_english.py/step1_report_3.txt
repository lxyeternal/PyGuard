{
  "purpose": "To normalize and standardize English text, including number conversion, spelling normalization, and cleaning text of extraneous symbols and phrases.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON file for spelling mappings; uses regex to process input string; imports from standard libraries and external modules; accesses resource files via importlib.resources.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex replacements and string manipulations; no direct untrusted data sinks, network operations, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex cleaning and pattern replacements -> number and spelling normalization -> final cleaned and standardized text output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior or unusual code structures. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. Use of external resource files could be a concern if tampered, but no evidence of malicious intent. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs text normalization with regex-based cleaning, loading spelling mappings from a JSON resource, and applying multiple transformations. The logic is consistent with standard text preprocessing and contains no indications of malicious behavior. No network or system modification code detected. Resource loading appears benign. Overall, the implementation aligns with expected behavior for a text normalization module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured text normalization module with no signs of malicious activity. It performs standard text processing tasks safely and predictably.",
