{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for normalizing, standardizing, and cleaning English text, including number normalization, spelling normalization, and overall text normalization as per OpenAI's specifications.",
  "sources": "Reads data from import statements, JSON file ('english.json'), and processes input strings.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful way; mainly string processing and regex substitutions.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex replacements and normalization steps -> output normalized string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The only external file accessed is a JSON for spelling mappings, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and one external dependency 'more_itertools'. It defines classes for number normalization, spelling normalization, and overall text normalization, all based on regex substitutions and data mappings. The file accesses a JSON resource to load spelling mappings, which is safe as it appears to be a benign configuration file. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears well-structured for text processing without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text normalization module from OpenAI's whisper repository, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only performs string processing and data loading from a local JSON resource. No malicious intent or malware signals are present.",
