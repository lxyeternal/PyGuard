{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to normalize and standardize English text, including converting written numbers to digits, correcting spelling differences, and cleaning up text formatting for speech recognition applications.",
  "sources": "It reads from external JSON file (english.json) during initialization; processes input strings through regex substitutions and method calls.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks handling untrusted data, user input, or external communication; no network or file output actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> preprocessing (regex cleaning) -> number and spelling normalization -> final cleaned text.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code appears to perform standard text processing tasks with no suspicious or unusual operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs text normalization by removing certain patterns (brackets, parentheses, filler words), replacing contractions, and converting written numbers and spellings to standardized forms. It loads a JSON mapping for spelling normalization, which could be a source of external dependency but is standard. The normalization logic is straightforward, with regex substitutions and data-driven mapping. No network operations, code injection, or system manipulation observed. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text normalization module with no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It primarily performs pattern matching and substitution for improving speech recognition output. The use of external JSON for spelling mapping is standard and does not introduce security concerns.",
