  "purpose": "Static metadata index generated by nbdev, listing symbol references, documentation URLs, and source file paths.",
  "sources": "Symbol mappings, documentation URLs, source file references within a large static dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely static with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; the code is straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large, static dictionary containing symbol references, documentation URLs, and source file paths, autogenerated for documentation or tooling support. It contains no functions, no input/output handling, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. All signals point to benign, static metadata with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static documentation index with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
