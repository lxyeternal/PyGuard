{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a metadata or documentation index, generated by nbdev, listing symbols, their locations, and associated documentation pages for a Python project related to language normalization.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static dictionary defining symbol mappings and metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands that could lead to data leaks or other effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists; the structure is purely static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a large static dictionary with no dynamic or obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is autogenerated documentation metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data structure with no functions, no input handling, and no executable behavior. It contains symbol mappings, documentation references, and file paths, typical of auto-generated documentation indexes. There is no malicious activity, no network access, and no obfuscation or malicious code. The content is purely informational metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign auto-generated documentation index, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain sensitive data. It appears to be a standard part of a documentation or code indexing system.",
