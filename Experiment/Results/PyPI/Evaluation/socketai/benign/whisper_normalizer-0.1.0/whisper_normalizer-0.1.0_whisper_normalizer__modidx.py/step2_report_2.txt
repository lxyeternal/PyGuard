  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a static dictionary containing metadata, symbol mappings, and documentation references. No dynamic code, no external data handling, no obfuscation, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Notes:** The report correctly identifies this as benign documentation metadata.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a static, auto-generated symbol index with no executable logic or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Notes:** The analysis is consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a static, auto-generated mapping for documentation, with no executable code or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Notes:** The conclusion aligns with the previous reports.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—static metadata for documentation, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Notes:** Consistent with prior findings.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Identical to others—static, auto-generated documentation index, no executable or malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — accurate.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Notes:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Justification\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is a static dictionary, auto-generated, with no executable logic, input handling, or network activity.\n- **Malware concerns:** None of the reports find any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden patterns.\n- **Security risk:** Given the nature of the code, the risk is negligible.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, static data structure.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security threat detected.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is purely metadata, likely part of documentation tooling, with no executable or harmful elements.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, auto-generated documentation index with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores and analysis are appropriate and justified.",
