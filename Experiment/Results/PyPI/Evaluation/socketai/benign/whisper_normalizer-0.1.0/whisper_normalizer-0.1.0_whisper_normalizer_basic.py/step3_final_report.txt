{
  "purpose": "The code provides text normalization functions for cleaning and standardizing text data, primarily for speech recognition preprocessing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings and processes them through regex patterns, Unicode normalization, and character classification.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks, network calls, or data exfiltration points; the code operates solely on input strings.",
  "flows": "Input strings are normalized, patterns (brackets, parentheses) are removed, diacritics are handled, and whitespace is normalized within the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Unicode normalization and regex pattern removal to clean text. It includes functions for removing symbols, diacritics, and optional grapheme splitting. The class `BasicTextNormalizer` performs multiple normalization steps, including removing bracketed phrases, parentheses, replacing symbols with spaces, converting to lowercase, and normalizing whitespace. No external system interactions or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is well-documented, clear, and designed solely for benign text processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard text normalization utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (0 or 0.2). Given the benign nature and lack of malicious activity, the overall security risk is effectively zero.",
