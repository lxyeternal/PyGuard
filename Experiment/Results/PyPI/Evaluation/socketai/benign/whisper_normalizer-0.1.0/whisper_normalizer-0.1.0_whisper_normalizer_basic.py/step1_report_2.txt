{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and a class for normalizing and cleaning text data by removing symbols, diacritics, and certain patterns like brackets and parentheses, mainly for language processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input string 's' in the functions and class methods.",
  "sinks": "The functions transform input text; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through normalization, pattern removal, and whitespace reduction processes within the class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code uses standard libraries and normal text processing methods. No external network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python libraries for string and Unicode handling, defines a mapping for special diacritics, and provides functions for removing symbols and diacritics. The 'remove_symbols_and_diacritics' function replaces or removes characters based on Unicode categories and a manual mapping. The 'remove_symbols' function replaces certain symbol categories with spaces. The 'BasicTextNormalizer' class performs multiple steps for text normalization, including removing bracketed and parenthesized content, replacing symbols with spaces, converting text to lowercase, optionally splitting into grapheme clusters, and collapsing multiple whitespace characters. All operations are typical for text preprocessing with no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard text normalization tasks for language processing and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be an open-source, benign utility for cleaning text data, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
