{
  "purpose": "The code provides text normalization functions, including removing diacritics, symbols, and punctuation, as well as normalizing text by removing bracketed content and extra whitespace, mainly for preprocessing in speech recognition tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, specifically string inputs passed to __call__ methods and normalization functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to external systems are present; no untrusted data is sent externally or stored unsafely.",
  "flows": "Input string -> normalization functions (removing bracketed/parenthesized content, symbols, diacritics) -> processed normalized string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are detected. Usage of regex patterns is straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward text normalization utilities aimed at cleaning and standardizing text data. The functions normalize unicode characters, remove specific content within brackets/parentheses, and replace symbols with spaces. The class 'BasicTextNormalizer' encapsulates these functions with options for diacritic removal and letter splitting. There is no evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. Usage of regex is typical and safe in this context. The code is well-documented and appears to be a standard implementation for text preprocessing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard text normalization module designed for speech recognition preprocessing. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It is a benign utility for data cleaning.",
