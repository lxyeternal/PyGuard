{
  "purpose": "The code provides text normalization functions and a class for cleaning and standardizing input text, particularly for speech recognition preprocessing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings passed to the remove_symbols_and_diacritics, remove_symbols functions, and the __call__ method of BasicTextNormalizer class.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could be processed through normalization functions and potentially exposed or misused if integrated into larger systems, but there are no direct data leaks or harmful actions performed within this code.",
  "flows": "Input string → normalization functions (removing brackets, symbols, diacritics) → optional letter splitting → whitespace normalization → output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code uses standard Unicode normalization and regex for text processing, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of text normalization techniques based on documented practices in speech recognition. It uses Unicode normalization, regex substitutions for removing brackets and parentheses, and optional splitting of graphemes. All functions utilize standard Python libraries without executing or evaluating untrusted code, and there are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-documented text normalization module with no indications of malicious intent. It is designed for preprocessing text data, and all operations are standard string processing techniques. There is no evidence of malware or security risks in this code.",
