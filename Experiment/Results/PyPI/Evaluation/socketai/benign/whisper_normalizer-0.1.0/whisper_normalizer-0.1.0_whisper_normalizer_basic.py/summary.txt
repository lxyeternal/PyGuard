  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard text normalization utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (0 or 0.2). Given the benign nature and lack of malicious activity, the overall security risk is effectively zero."
