  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward text normalization utility, primarily for speech recognition preprocessing.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code relies solely on standard libraries (`re`, `unicodedata`, `regex`) and simple string processing techniques.\n- The functions and class perform pattern removal, diacritic handling, and whitespace normalization, with optional grapheme splitting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \n  The code matches the description: functions remove symbols, diacritics, brackets, parentheses, and normalize whitespace. No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n  **Confirmed:** No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**  \n  The reports consistently state the code is benign, with no suspicious behavior, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.  \n  **Confirmed:** No logical flaws or errors in the reports.\n\n- **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n  - `malware`: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n  - `securityRisk`: Mostly 0 or very low (0.2), which is reasonable considering the code's harmlessness.  \n  - `obfuscated`: 0 in all reports, consistent with the clear code.  \n  - `confidence`: Ranges from 0.9 to 1, reflecting high certainty about benignity.\n\n  **Suggestion:** The `securityRisk` score could be uniformly set to 0, as no security concerns are evident.\n\n- **Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports justify a high risk score; all correctly assign low scores.  \n  **Confirmed:** No reason to increase scores.\n\n- **Malware Score Justification:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.  \n  **Confirmed:** Malware score should remain 0.\n\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions and stick to observable facts—no hidden behaviors or obfuscation.\n\n- **Consistency of Scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**  \n  The code is purely for text normalization; no external dependencies, network calls, or file operations.  \n  No evidence of vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n- **Obfuscation or Hidden Behavior:**  \n  No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Impact of Aggressive Normalization:**  \n  While aggressive normalization might impact non-English vowels, this is a documented limitation, not malicious. It does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal normalization impact, but 0 is more appropriate)  \n\n**Overall Security Assessment:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is a standard, well-documented text normalization utility.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware score at **0**.  \n- Keep obfuscated at **0**.  \n- Keep security risk at **0**.  \n- Overall risk score: **0**.\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's straightforward nature.",
