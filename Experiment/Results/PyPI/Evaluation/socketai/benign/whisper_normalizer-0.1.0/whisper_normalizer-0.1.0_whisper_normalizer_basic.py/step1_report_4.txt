{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and a class for normalizing and cleaning text data, specifically for non-English text normalization and preprocessing as part of speech recognition models.",
  "sources": "The code reads input text strings provided to the `__call__` method of `BasicTextNormalizer`, and utilizes internal dictionaries and regular expressions for processing.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data sinks; the functions return cleaned text strings. No network, file, or system interactions are present that could leak data or perform unauthorized actions.",
  "flows": "Input string -> normalization and cleaning functions -> processed string output. No external untrusted data sources or sinks involved beyond input strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are detected. The code mainly uses standard libraries (`re`, `unicodedata`, `regex`) for text processing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing text normalization tasks such as removing bracketed and parenthesized content, replacing symbols and punctuation with spaces, converting to lowercase, and optionally splitting graphemes. It uses standard Python libraries with no network, system calls, or external data manipulation that could be malicious. The only potential concern is that it performs aggressive normalization which might impact non-English language vowels, but this is a documented limitation, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard text normalization module with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs typical preprocessing for speech recognition pipelines and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code. No security risks or malware are detected.",
