{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup and build configuration script for the PyObjC framework, handling environment detection, SDK configuration, testing, and packaging on macOS systems.",
  "sources": "System commands ('sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun'), environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS), SDK plist files, filesystem files (SDKSettings.plist, header files), dynamic module imports, sys.path modifications.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of system utilities via subprocess, reading and parsing plist files, modifying sys.path and sys.modules, executing test suites, writing build info files.",
  "flows": "Sources such as subprocess calls and environment variables influence build flags and SDK detection; these affect the compilation process and test execution; file reads provide SDK info; all flow into build configuration and testing routines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. Use of subprocess and environment variables is standard for build scripts. No suspicious network activity or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs system info gathering via subprocess, reads SDK configuration files, manipulates sys.path for module loading, and executes tests. It adjusts build flags based on SDK and system version detection. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The reliance on system commands and environment variables is typical for build environments but could be exploited if the environment is compromised. The code is well-structured, with clear intent, and aligns with standard build and test automation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and test setup script for PyObjC, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and justified based on its behavior and purpose.",
