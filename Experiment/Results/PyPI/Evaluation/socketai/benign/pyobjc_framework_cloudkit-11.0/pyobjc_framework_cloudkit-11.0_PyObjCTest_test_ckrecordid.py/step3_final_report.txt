  "purpose": "A unit test verifying the existence and type of CKRecordID in the CloudKit framework, ensuring framework integrity on macOS 10.10+.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the min_os_level decorator, which do not read external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs attribute checks only without data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Simple attribute existence and type assertions; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard test code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing utilities, applies a version guard, and asserts class attributes. It performs no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. All signals indicate benign, environment validation code. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, environment-specific unit test verifying framework attributes. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, aligning with its harmless nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
