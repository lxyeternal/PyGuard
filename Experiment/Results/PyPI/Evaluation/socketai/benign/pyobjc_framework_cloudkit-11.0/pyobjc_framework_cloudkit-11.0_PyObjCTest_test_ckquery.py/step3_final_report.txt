  "purpose": "Verify the existence and type of CKQuery class within the CloudKit framework on macOS 10.10+.",
  "sources": "Import statements, decorator @min_os_level, attribute access CloudKit.CKQuery",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs only attribute checks and assertions",
  "flows": "Import modules -> OS version check -> Attribute existence check -> Type assertion",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class existence test with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple unit test verifying that CloudKit has an attribute CKQuery and that it is an instance of objc.objc_class, only executing on macOS 10.10 or later. It involves no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, standard for framework validation, and contains no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a benign environment check with appropriate, consistent scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API validation test with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The overall confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
