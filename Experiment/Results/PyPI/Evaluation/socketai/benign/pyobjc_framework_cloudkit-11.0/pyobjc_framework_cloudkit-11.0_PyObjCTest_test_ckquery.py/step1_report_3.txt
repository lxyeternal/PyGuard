  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for verifying the presence and type of CloudKit.CKQuery class on macOS 10.10+ using the PyObjCTools testing framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements for TestCase, min_os_level, CloudKit, and objc modules; usage of min_os_level decorator; access to CloudKit.CKQuery attribute.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that access CloudKit.CKQuery attribute and check its class type.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Decorator check for OS level -> Access to CloudKit.CKQuery -> Assertion checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing utilities and CloudKit modules to verify the existence and type of CKQuery class on macOS 10.10 or higher. The min_os_level decorator ensures compatibility checks. The assertions confirm that CKQuery exists within CloudKit and is an Objective-C class. No data input/output, no external data sources, or potentially malicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test for checking the presence and type of a CloudKit class, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
