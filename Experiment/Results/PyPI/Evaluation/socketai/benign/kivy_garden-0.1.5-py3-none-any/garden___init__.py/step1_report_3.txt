{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a basic utility for handling data, possibly involving network communication or data processing.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading from files, user input, network requests), environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network send/receive functions, file write/read, command execution, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data is read from sources (e.g., input, environment) and then processed or sent to sinks such as network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected. Check for hidden network calls or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and does not contain apparent obfuscation or suspicious constructs. It reads data from input or environment, processes it, and potentially transmits or writes it. No hardcoded credentials or network connections are explicitly visible. However, without specifics of the functions, potential covert data transfer or hidden malicious behavior cannot be fully ruled out. The overall structure suggests benign intent, but further details would improve confidence.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose appears to be standard data handling, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. Confidence is moderate due to lack of specific details.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
