      "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 2 indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity, justified by suspicious code patterns. Other reports are consistent with benign or low-risk code. The scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to reflect the potential risk in Report 4. Overall, the supply chain security assessment suggests a moderate to high risk primarily driven by patterns in Report 2."
