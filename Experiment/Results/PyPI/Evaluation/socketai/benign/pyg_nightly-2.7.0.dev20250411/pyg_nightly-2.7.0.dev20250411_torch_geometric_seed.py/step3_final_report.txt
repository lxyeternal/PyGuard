  "purpose": "Set seeds for random number generators in Python, NumPy, and PyTorch (including CUDA) to ensure reproducibility.",
  "sources": "Input seed parameter provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "None; the function only sets seeds internally without external data flow or output.",
  "flows": "Input seed -> random.seed, np.random.seed, torch.manual_seed, torch.cuda.manual_seed_all",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward seed-setting code with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a function to set seeds across Python's random, NumPy, and PyTorch (including CUDA). It includes a descriptive docstring and applies the seed uniformly. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The purpose is solely to ensure reproducibility. The code is clear, standard, and safe. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for reproducibility with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
