{
  "purpose": "The code sets seeds for random number generators in Python, NumPy, and PyTorch to ensure reproducibility of results in scientific or machine learning experiments.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'seed' and uses it to set seeds for random, numpy, and torch libraries.",
  "sinks": "The seed value is used internally by the random number generators; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input seed -> random.seed, np.random.seed, torch.manual_seed, torch.cuda.manual_seed_all",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without unusual code constructs; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The function is a typical seed-setting utility for ensuring reproducibility across various Python libraries used in scientific computing. It takes an integer seed as input and applies it to the Python random module, NumPy, and PyTorch, including CUDA for GPU computations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is well-structured, with clear comments, and uses standard library functions. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function aimed at reproducibility. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
