{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and sets random seeds across Python's random module, NumPy, and PyTorch for reproducibility in machine learning experiments.",
  "sources": "The seed value provided as an argument to the function seed_everything.",
  "sinks": "The seed values used in random.seed(), np.random.seed(), torch.manual_seed(), and torch.cuda.manual_seed_all().",
  "flows": "Input seed -> seed_everything() function -> setting seeds in random, numpy, and torch modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes an integer seed as input and sets it across multiple popular random number generators used in Python and PyTorch. The purpose appears to be ensuring reproducibility by synchronizing randomness sources. All operations involve setting seeds; there are no network operations, no data exfiltration, no backdoors, or other suspicious behaviors. Usage of seed-setting functions is common in scientific computing and machine learning workflows. There is no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and standard in nature.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for setting random seeds in reproducible experiments. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for use in machine learning projects.",
