{
  "purpose": "The code sets the seed for random number generation across Python's random module, NumPy, and PyTorch to ensure reproducibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'seed' argument passed to the function; it also accesses random, numpy, and torch modules for setting seeds.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to random, numpy, and torch's seed settings, but these are standard for reproducibility and not malicious.",
  "flows": "Input seed flows from the function argument into seed-setting functions of random, numpy, and torch modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code performs a common reproducibility setup without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The function 'seed_everything' is designed to initialize the random number generators of various libraries used in scientific computing and machine learning. It accepts an integer seed and applies it to Python's 'random', NumPy's 'np.random', and PyTorch's 'torch' modules, including CUDA-specific seed setting for GPU operations. The code uses standard library functions with no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious actions detected. It is a typical utility function for ensuring deterministic behavior during experiments or model training.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for setting random seeds for reproducibility in Python, NumPy, and PyTorch. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is a benign and common pattern in scientific code.",
