{
  "purpose": "The function 'seed_everything' sets the seed for random number generation across Python's random module, numpy, and PyTorch to ensure reproducibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the seed value from the function argument 'seed'.",
  "sinks": "The seed value itself; setting seeds affects randomness but does not directly leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input seed -> setting seeds in random, numpy, torch, and torch.cuda; no further data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code performs standard seed setting for reproducibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to initialize seeds for reproducible randomness in Python, numpy, and PyTorch environments. It uses standard library functions to set seeds, including for CUDA. There are no suspicious data flows, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. The code performs a common task in machine learning workflows, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard seed initialization function for reproducibility in ML workflows. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
