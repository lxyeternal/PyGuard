{
  "purpose": "The function 'seed_everything' sets random seeds for reproducibility in Python, NumPy, and PyTorch.",
  "sources": "The function reads an input parameter 'seed' and accesses modules 'random', 'numpy', and 'torch' to set seeds.",
  "sinks": "The seed values are used internally to initialize pseudo-random number generators; no external sink is present.",
  "flows": "Input 'seed' flows into seed-setting functions of 'random', 'np.random', and 'torch' modules; no external data flow or output manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. All operations are standard seed initialization routines.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a function to set seeds for reproducibility across various random number generators. It uses provided seed values to initialize the generators in 'random', 'numpy', and 'torch', including CUDA-specific seed setting for GPU computations. There are no suspicious or malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The code performs a common, benign task typical in machine learning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward seed initialization function without any malicious intent or security concerns. It is a standard utility used in reproducible experiments. No security risks or malware behaviors are detected.",
