  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for hardware detection in PyTorch, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with appropriate scoring. The overall assessment should assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0."
