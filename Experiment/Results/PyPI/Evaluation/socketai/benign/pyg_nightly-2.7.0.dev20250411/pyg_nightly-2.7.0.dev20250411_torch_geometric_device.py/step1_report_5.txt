{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to check hardware availability and select the appropriate device for PyTorch computations.",
  "sources": "Imports torch module, reads hardware capabilities via hasattr and is_available methods, attempts to import external library (intel_extension_for_pytorch).",
  "sinks": "Uses torch.device objects, which are safe; no data sinks identified that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Checks hardware support, then returns device objects based on availability; no external data flow or untrusted input processing that leads to security risks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The try-except blocks handle potential import errors or hardware access issues appropriately. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs hardware capability checks using standard PyTorch attributes and methods. It imports an external library (intel_extension_for_pytorch) safely with error handling. Device selection logic is straightforward and based solely on hardware detection, with no external data input or execution of untrusted code. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected, and no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard hardware availability and device selection utility for PyTorch, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
