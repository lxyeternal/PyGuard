{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check hardware availability (MPS, XPU, CUDA) and select the appropriate device for PyTorch computations.",
  "sources": "Reads system hardware capabilities via PyTorch attributes and imports, and user-provided device input.",
  "sinks": "Uses device() method to set computation device; no untrusted data flows into critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'device' influences device selection; hardware checks determine device choice; no external data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of try-except blocks is standard for hardware detection.",
  "analysis": "The code safely checks for hardware availability using standard PyTorch attributes and methods. It attempts to import 'intel_extension_for_pytorch' within a try-except block to handle missing modules, which is normal. Device selection logic prioritizes available hardware in a typical manner. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data manipulation, or suspicious network activity. The functions serve a legitimate purpose related to hardware detection and device selection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for hardware detection in PyTorch with no malicious intent. It performs standard checks and device selection logic without suspicious or malicious behavior. No security risks are evident.",
