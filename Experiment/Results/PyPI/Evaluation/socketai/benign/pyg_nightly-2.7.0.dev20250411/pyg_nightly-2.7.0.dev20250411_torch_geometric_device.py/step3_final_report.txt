  "purpose": "Hardware detection and device selection for PyTorch, checking availability of MPS, XPU, and CUDA devices.",
  "sources": "hasattr checks for torch.backends.mps and torch.xpu, import of torch, optional import of intel_extension_for_pytorch, device attribute input.",
  "sinks": "torch.empty(1, device='mps') for MPS availability, torch.device() for device selection.",
  "flows": "Source: attribute checks and import statements; Sink: device() function creating torch.device objects based on availability.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward hardware detection logic with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard hardware detection by checking attributes and availability of specific backends, with exception handling for optional imports. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The logic is clear, and the code is well-structured. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign and transparent nature of the code. The minimal risk score of 0.1 is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 given the lack of any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for hardware detection in PyTorch, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with appropriate scoring. The overall assessment should assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.",
