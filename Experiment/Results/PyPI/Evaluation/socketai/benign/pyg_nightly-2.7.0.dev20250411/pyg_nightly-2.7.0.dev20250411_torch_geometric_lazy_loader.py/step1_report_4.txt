  "purpose": "Implement a lazy loader class that defers module import until attribute access to optimize performance and resource usage.",
  "sources": "import_module function, self.__name__ attribute, self._parent_module_globals dictionary",
  "sinks": "self._parent_module_globals[self._local_name] assignment, getattr calls on the loaded module",
  "flows": "import_module(self.__name__) -> updating globals with module -> getattr on module attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code dynamically loads modules, which is standard in lazy loading patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LazyLoader class inheriting from ModuleType, with methods to defer loading a module until its attributes are accessed. It uses import_module for on-demand import, updating the parent's globals with the module to ensure subsequent accesses are faster. The implementation appears standard and follows common lazy loading patterns. No malicious activity or anomalies such as hidden backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a lazy loading mechanism for modules. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and intentional for performance optimization.",
