  "purpose": "This code defines a LazyLoader class for on-demand importing of modules to optimize performance and reduce initial load time.",
  "sources": "import_module from importlib, access to self.__name__ and self._parent_module_globals",
  "sinks": "getattr calls on lazy-loaded modules, update of module dictionaries",
  "flows": "LazyLoader.__getattr__ triggers self._load, which imports the module and updates globals",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The pattern is a known lazy loading technique from TensorFlow's codebase.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a lazy loading mechanism for modules using importlib. It delays importing until attributes are accessed, which is a common pattern for efficiency. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, backdoors, or data theft. The only potential concern is that it dynamically loads modules and updates globals, which could be misused if the module name is externally controlled; however, as given, the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of lazy module loading, with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be safe, provided that module names are controlled or validated elsewhere.",
