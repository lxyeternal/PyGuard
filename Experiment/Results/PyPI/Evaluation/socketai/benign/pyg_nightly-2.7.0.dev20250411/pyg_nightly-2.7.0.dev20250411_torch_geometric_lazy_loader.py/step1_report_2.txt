  "purpose": "A lazy loader class to defer importing modules until they are actually used, optimizing startup time and resource usage.",
  "sources": "import_module() function call within the _load() method, which dynamically imports a module by name.",
  "sinks": "getattr() in __getattr__() to access module attributes, and __dir__() to list module attributes after loading.",
  "flows": "The class initializes with module name and globals, then upon attribute access or dir call, _load() is invoked to import the module and update globals, allowing subsequent access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The dynamic import relies on a module name provided at initialization but no malicious pattern is evident; no obfuscated code, no external network activity, or malicious side effects are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LazyLoader class inheriting from ModuleType to delay the import of a module until an attribute is accessed or dir() is called. The class stores the module name and parent globals, then loads the module when needed via import_module(). It updates the parent globals with the imported module and its attributes, allowing transparent access. This pattern is used for performance optimization and does not involve malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, without obfuscated constructs or hidden malicious intent. The import is based on a module name provided at instantiation, which could be manipulated if user-controlled, but this is standard for lazy loading and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard lazy loading mechanism for modules, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It uses dynamic imports responsibly and without suspicious patterns. Overall, it appears safe.",
