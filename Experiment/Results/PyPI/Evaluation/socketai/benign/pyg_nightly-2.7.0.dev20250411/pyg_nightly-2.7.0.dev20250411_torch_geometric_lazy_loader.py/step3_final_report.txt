{
  "purpose": "Implements a lazy module loader that defers importing a module until its attributes are accessed, optimizing performance.",
  "sources": "The module name stored in self.__name__ used in import_module within _load()",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the import_module call if self.__name__ is externally controlled, leading to arbitrary module import",
  "flows": "Access to attributes (__getattr__) triggers _load(), which imports the module and updates globals",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code; reliance on dynamic import based on self.__name__ which could be manipulated if externally controlled",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard lazy loader pattern, delaying module import until needed. It uses importlib.import_module with self.__name__, which is typical but assumes controlled input. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is if self.__name__ is derived from untrusted sources, it could lead to loading malicious modules. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with this understanding. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and aligns with known patterns for performance optimization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a lazy loader with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk exists if module names are externally manipulated, but in typical controlled environments, this is not an issue. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
