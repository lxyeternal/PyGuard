{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities to manage experimental features and modes, including decorators and context managers to enable or disable certain behaviors related to dynamic shapes and experimental flags within the torch_geometric library.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (functools, inspect, typing), and third-party modules (torch, torch_geometric.utils).",
  "sinks": "The main sink is in the 'disable_dynamic_shapes' decorator, which reads function arguments to enforce constraints based on experimental flags.",
  "flows": "The decorator reads function signatures, then during function calls, depending on experimental mode, it inspects arguments to enforce constraints or raise errors if conditions are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code manipulates internal flags and enforces argument constraints but does not perform any suspicious operations like network access, file modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines control structures to manage experimental modes via context managers and functions, including a decorator to disable dynamic shapes by enforcing argument presence. It uses standard introspection and flag management. No obfuscated language features or malicious behavior observed. The functionality is to control feature flags and argument enforcement, which is typical for such libraries. No signs of data leaks, network operations, or backdoors. The only potential concern could be misuse of the decorator for unintended enforcement, but that is benign and consistent with its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for managing experimental features within a library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It enforces argument presence when dynamic shapes are disabled but does not perform any malicious operations. Overall, it is a benign and well-structured utility module.",
