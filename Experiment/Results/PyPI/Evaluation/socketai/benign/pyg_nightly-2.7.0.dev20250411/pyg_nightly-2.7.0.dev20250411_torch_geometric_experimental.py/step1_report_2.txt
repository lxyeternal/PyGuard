{
  "purpose": "Provides utilities for managing experimental features and modes within the torch_geometric library, including context managers and decorators to toggle modes and enforce argument requirements.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard Python modules (functools, inspect, typing), and the torch library; uses getfullargspec to inspect function signatures; reads mode flags from __experimental_flag__; reads input parameters from function arguments and environment states.",
  "sinks": "None present. No direct untrusted data sinks or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "The decorator 'disable_dynamic_shapes' reads function signatures (sources), and enforces argument presence based on experimental mode flags; mode management functions read/write mode flags in __experimental_flag__ (sources), affecting behavior of decorators (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors. The use of '__experimental_flag__' for feature toggling is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines feature flags and utilities to toggle experimental features, including context managers and decorators. The 'disable_dynamic_shapes' decorator checks if the experimental mode 'disable_dynamic_shapes' is enabled and enforces argument requirements accordingly. No untrusted data sources, network operations, or system modifications are present. All functions rely on internal flags and function signature inspection to enforce constraints, which is safe. No code indicates malicious intent or security compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of feature toggling and argument enforcement utilities for experimental features in a library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious data handling. The use of experimental flags is benign and intended for development/testing purposes.",
