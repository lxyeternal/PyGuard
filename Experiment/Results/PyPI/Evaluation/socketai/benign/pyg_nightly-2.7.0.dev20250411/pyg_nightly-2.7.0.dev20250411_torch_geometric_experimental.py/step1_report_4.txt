  "purpose": "This code provides utilities to manage experimental features and a decorator to enforce static shape requirements in PyTorch functions, mainly for debugging or development purposes.",
  "sources": "User-controlled function arguments, configuration flags (__experimental_flag__), environment checks (torch.jit).",
  "sinks": "Function calls (via decorators), setting flags, exception raising, potentially halting execution.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> function validation/modification -> conditional behavior based on flags -> function execution or error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The disable_dynamic_shapes decorator conditionally enforces argument presence based on experimental mode flags. No code performs network operations, file access, or system modifications. No obfuscated code or malicious data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of utilities to toggle and manage experimental features within a PyTorch-based library, including context managers and decorators. It uses standard Python practices for argument inspection, context management, and flag toggling. The 'disable_dynamic_shapes' decorator enforces the presence of specified arguments when a particular experimental mode is active, which could be used for debugging or enforcing API correctness. All functions and methods serve legitimate purposes related to feature management and debugging. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code operates entirely within the local runtime environment, manipulating internal flags and enforcing argument constraints.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module intended for feature toggling and argument validation in a PyTorch setting. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The only potential concern is its dependence on internal flags and environment states, but these are used for legitimate development and debugging purposes. Overall, the code appears safe and free from security risks.",
