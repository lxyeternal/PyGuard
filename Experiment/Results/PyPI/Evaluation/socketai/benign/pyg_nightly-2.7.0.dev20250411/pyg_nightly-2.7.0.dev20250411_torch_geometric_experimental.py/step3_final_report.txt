  "purpose": "Utility functions and context managers for managing experimental features and enforcing argument constraints related to dynamic shapes in PyTorch/geometric.",
  "sources": "Reads from internal flags (__experimental_flag__), function signatures via inspect, and input arguments to decorators.",
  "sinks": "Enforces argument presence and mode toggling; no external data sinks, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Checks internal flags, inspects function signatures, enforces argument presence based on flags, and manages context states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Wildcard import from torch_geometric.utils is noted but common in scientific code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides feature toggling and argument validation utilities using standard Python constructs. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on internal flag management and enforcement during debugging or experimental runs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for managing experimental modes and argument enforcement within the PyTorch/geometric ecosystem. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
