  "purpose": "Utility functions to manage warnings conditionally based on torch_geometric's compilation state.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'message' in warn(), 'action' and 'message' in filterwarnings()",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() and warnings.filterwarnings() calls with user-provided parameters",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into warnings functions, conditioned on torch_geometric.is_compiling()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward wrapper functions with conditional early return",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple wrapper functions around Python's warnings module, with a check on torch_geometric.is_compiling(). No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious activities are present. Parameters are typical for warning functions, and their usage is controlled within the functions. No external untrusted data sources are evident. The functions serve to suppress or filter warnings during compilation, a standard pattern. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code's behavior is benign, and the conditional check is a common practice to avoid warnings during build phases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing warnings during module compilation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward and safe nature.",
