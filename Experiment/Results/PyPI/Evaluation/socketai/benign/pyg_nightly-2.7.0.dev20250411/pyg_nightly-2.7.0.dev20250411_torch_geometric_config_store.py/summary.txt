  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, well-structured configuration management utility for ML components, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The dynamic registration and reflection features are standard and do not pose a security threat in this context. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
