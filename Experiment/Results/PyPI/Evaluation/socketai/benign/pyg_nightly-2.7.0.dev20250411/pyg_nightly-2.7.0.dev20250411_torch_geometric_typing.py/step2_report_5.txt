  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code manages dependencies, version checks, and feature flags for a PyTorch graph library. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard dependency management with no signs of malicious activity. The report's confidence (0.9) is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency setup, with extensive use of try-except for optional libraries. No malicious activity observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. The low risk score is justified.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical dependency setup, with no malicious logic. The confidence (0.95) is high.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, dependency detection and fallback classes, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is benign setup code. Confidence is high (1.0).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Dependency management with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Standard dependency handling, no malicious signs. Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Environment setup, optional dependencies, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0.1. The low risk score is justified.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity detected; benign setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's purpose. No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation techniques (e.g., encoding, dynamic code execution, misleading variable names). The complexity is due to dependency management, not obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—dependency detection, environment checks, fallback classes—there's no evidence of security risks or malicious intent. The low risk scores (0.1 or 0.0) are appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code performs environment and dependency management, a common and benign pattern.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration are present.\n- The extensive use of try-except blocks for optional dependencies is standard practice.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code constructs are detected.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0** (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, due to dependency management complexity but no security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured dependency management code with no security risks or malware.",
