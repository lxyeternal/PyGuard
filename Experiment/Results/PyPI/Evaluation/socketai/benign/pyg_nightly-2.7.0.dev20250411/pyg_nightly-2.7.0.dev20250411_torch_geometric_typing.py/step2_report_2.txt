  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages dependencies for a PyTorch graph library, with safe import patterns, version checks, and conditional class definitions. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Code presence:** All described dependencies and checks are present.\n  - **Logic flaws:** None identified; reasoning aligns with the code.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign dependency management.\n  - **Justification for risk score:** Since no malicious activity is present, a low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency setup with extensive use of try-except blocks, safe handling, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Code presence:** All described features are present.\n  - **Logic flaws:** No issues; reasoning consistent.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n  - **Potential concern:** The fallback classes raising ImportError are standard, not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, dependency setup, environment checks, and fallback classes, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Code presence:** All described features are present.\n  - **Logic flaws:** None; reasoning aligns.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n  - **Confidence:** 1.0 indicates high certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and thorough; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, dependency management, environment checks, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Code presence:** All features are present.\n  - **Logic flaws:** None.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 reasonable.\n  - **Confidence:** 0.9, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; scores justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: environment checks, optional dependencies, safe fallback classes, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Code presence:** All described features are present.\n  - **Logic flaws:** None.\n  - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 or 0.1 are appropriate.\n  - **Note:** The report states \"no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident,\" so a risk score of 0 or 0.1 is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The scores of 0 or 0.1 are appropriate, considering the code is purely dependency management with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's straightforward nature.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, reflecting minimal security concern—mainly dependency handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.05** — Very low, since the code only manages dependencies and feature detection without any suspicious activity.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard dependency and environment setup module for a PyTorch-based graph processing library. It employs safe patterns, handles optional dependencies gracefully, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The overall security risk is negligible.",
