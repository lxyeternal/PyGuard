  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code manages dependencies, performs environment/version checks, and defines placeholder classes for optional libraries. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both at 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, consistent with thorough dependency checks.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; the code is standard dependency management.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency setup with extensive use of try-except blocks, version checks, and fallback classes. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, securityRisk at 0.1 (a low, acceptable level for dependency management code).\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, high due to detailed analysis.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent; standard setup code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment configuration, optional dependencies, and safe import patterns. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, securityRisk at 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0, very high.\n- **Assessment:** Clearly benign, typical for dependency setup.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency and environment detection logic, with no malicious code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, securityRisk at 0.1.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; standard dependency handling.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a setup script with environment checks, optional dependencies, and fallback classes. No malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, securityRisk at 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns; typical dependency management.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; the code is straightforward dependency management.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, mostly due to dependency handling, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code performs environment detection, conditional imports, and defines placeholder classes for optional dependencies, all standard practices.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The extensive use of try-except blocks and warnings aligns with robust dependency management, not malicious obfuscation.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to dependency complexity but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured dependency setup for a PyTorch-based graph processing library. It poses no security threat or malware risk.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you need further analysis or specific focus on any part.",
