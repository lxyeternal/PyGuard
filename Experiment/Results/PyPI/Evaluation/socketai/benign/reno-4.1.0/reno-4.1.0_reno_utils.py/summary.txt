  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with minor security considerations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious external activity are present. The fallback randomness should be documented as insecure for cryptographic purposes, and logging practices should be improved to prevent info leaks. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."
