  "sources": "os.urandom(), random.randrange(), subprocess.Popen() with command arguments",
  "sinks": "subprocess execution, output decoding, debug logging",
  "flows": "get_random_string() uses os.urandom() or fallback to random.randrange(); check_output() runs external commands and processes output",
  "anomalies": "Fallback to insecure random.randrange() for cryptographic purposes; debug logs may leak sensitive info; no input validation shown for subprocess arguments",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions without malicious code or backdoors. The fallback to random.randrange() is insecure for cryptographic use but is a common fallback pattern, not malicious. Logging debug info could leak sensitive data if logs are improperly secured. The subprocess function does not sanitize inputs, posing a potential command injection risk if external untrusted data is passed, but no such usage is demonstrated. Overall, the code is straightforward, with minor security concerns related to fallback randomness and logging practices, but no malicious intent or malware is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with minor security considerations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious external activity are present. The fallback randomness should be documented as insecure for cryptographic purposes, and logging practices should be improved to prevent info leaks. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero.",
