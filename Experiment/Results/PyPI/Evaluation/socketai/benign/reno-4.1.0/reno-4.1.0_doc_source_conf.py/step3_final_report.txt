  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, defining extensions, themes, and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments, module imports, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data flows; configuration does not process external input.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Sphinx configuration file with no dynamic or external data processing. It imports extensions, sets project info, theme, and warning suppression. No network activity, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is readable, standard, and contains no suspicious patterns or malicious code. All signals indicate benign intent, with no obfuscation or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script with no malicious behavior or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
