  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code follows standard configuration practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file setting up extensions, project info, and themes. It only contains static data and configuration directives with no external data input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The code appears legitimate and typical for documentation configuration. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code are present.",
