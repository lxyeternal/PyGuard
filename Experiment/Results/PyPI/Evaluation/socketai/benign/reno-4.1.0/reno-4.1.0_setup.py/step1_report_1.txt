  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools and calling setuptools.setup() with minimal arguments. It specifies 'setup_requires' and 'pbr' usage, which are common practices for package setup. The comments indicate it is managed by a requirements repository and licensed under Apache 2.0. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior. The code is purely configuration for packaging and distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
