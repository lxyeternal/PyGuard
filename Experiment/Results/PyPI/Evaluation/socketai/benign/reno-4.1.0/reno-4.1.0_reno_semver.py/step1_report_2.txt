{
  "purpose": "Compute the next semantic version based on release notes and version history.",
  "sources": "The code reads version data from the 'loader' object and parses version notes from files via ldr.parse_note_file.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and returns a version string; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects system security directly.",
  "flows": "Version data flows from ldr.versions and ldr[ver] into version parsing and note analysis, resulting in a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of standard logging and version parsing libraries is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code loads version information via a loader, analyzes release notes for major, minor, or patch updates, and computes the next version accordingly. It relies on the 'packaging' library for version parsing and 'reno' for loader functions. The logic is straightforward, primarily reading version info and release notes, then incrementing version parts based on detected notes. No malicious data handling, external command execution, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard versioning utility script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs version computation based on release notes, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
