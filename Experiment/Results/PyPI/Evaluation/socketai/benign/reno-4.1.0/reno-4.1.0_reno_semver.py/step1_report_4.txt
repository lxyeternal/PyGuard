  "purpose": "Compute the next semantic version based on release notes and versioning rules.",
  "sources": "Loader context manager (ldr), ldr.versions, ldr.parse_note_file, ldr[] access, conf.semver_major/minor/patch, notes.get",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as data output is mainly through logging and return values.",
  "flows": "Loading versions and notes from loader -> parsing notes -> determining version increments -> returning new version string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of loader.Loader context manager with ignore_cache=True; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code loads version data using a context manager, processes version notes, and determines the next semantic version based on detected major, minor, or patch changes. It uses the 'packaging.version' library for version parsing, which is standard. The logic includes logging for debugging purposes and proper version increment calculations. No untrusted input handling or external data transmission is present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate versioning utility with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, well-structured version computation script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It performs version analysis and incrementing based on release notes without interacting with external or untrusted sources in a suspicious manner.",
