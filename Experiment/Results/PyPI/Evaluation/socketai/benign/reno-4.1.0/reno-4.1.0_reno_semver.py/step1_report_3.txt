{
  "purpose": "Compute the next semantic version based on release notes and version history, supporting version bumping logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads version data from the 'loader' object, and parses version notes via 'ldr.parse_note_file'. It also reads version info from 'ldr.versions'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or external effect; the code only processes version info and logs debug messages.",
  "flows": "Version data flows from 'ldr.versions' and 'ldr[ver]' into the logic that determines the next version; notes are retrieved via 'ldr.parse_note_file' and used to decide version increments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies on standard version parsing and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code loads version data and release notes from a loader object, then processes version notes to determine whether to increment major, minor, or patch version components. It only uses standard libraries and logging; no external or suspicious data manipulation occurs. The version handling and note parsing follow typical semantic versioning logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or security vulnerabilities in this implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version calculation script with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It strictly manages versioning logic based on release notes and version history, using standard Python libraries and practices.",
