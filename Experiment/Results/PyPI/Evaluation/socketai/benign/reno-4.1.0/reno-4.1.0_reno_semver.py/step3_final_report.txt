  "flows": "version.Version(to_consider) -> notes.get() -> inc_minor/inc_patch flags -> final version string",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; reliance on external loader modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard semantic versioning logic, reading version info via an external loader, parsing release notes, and incrementing version components based on detected changes. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The logic is straightforward, with appropriate use of version parsing and note analysis. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to dependency reliance, but no malicious intent or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version bumping utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The code's purpose and implementation are straightforward and safe.",
