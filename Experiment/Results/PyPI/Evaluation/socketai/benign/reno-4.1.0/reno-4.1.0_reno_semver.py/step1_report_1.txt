{
  "purpose": "Compute the next semantic version based on release notes and version history.",
  "sources": "ldr.versions, ldr[ver], ldr.parse_note_file",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code outputs a version string.",
  "flows": "Versions and notes are read from the loader; version string is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version management by reading release notes and version history from an external loader. It parses version information and notes, determines if major, minor, or patch increments are needed, and outputs the next version. All data sources are read from the loader module, which is presumed to be a standard dependency. No user input, network operations, or untrusted data flows are present. The logic appears straightforward and aligned with standard semantic versioning practices. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical versioning utility with no malicious intent. It relies on external loader modules for data, and all operations are standard for semantic version calculation. No security risks or malware are evident.",
