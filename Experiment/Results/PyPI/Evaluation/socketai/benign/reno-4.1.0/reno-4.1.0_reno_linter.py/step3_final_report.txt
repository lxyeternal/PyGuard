  "purpose": "Validate YAML note files for unrecognized sections and UID collisions to ensure consistency and correctness.",
  "sources": "Reading YAML files from the filesystem, parsing them with loader, and obtaining unique IDs via scanner.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only filesystem reads, parsing, and logging warnings.",
  "flows": "Filesystem input -> parsing -> validation checks -> logging warnings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation of note files, checking for unrecognized section names and UID collisions. It uses standard libraries and internal modules without executing untrusted code or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The operations are read-only and intended for validation, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0. The security risk score can be lowered to 0, reflecting negligible risk.",
