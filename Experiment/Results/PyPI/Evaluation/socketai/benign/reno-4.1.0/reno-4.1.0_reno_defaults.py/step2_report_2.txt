  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Malicious Indicators:**\n   - All reports consistently identify that the code is static, consists solely of string constants and templates, and does not process any untrusted data, perform code execution, network communication, or any dynamic behavior.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n   - The license header is standard and non-malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and purely configuration/template code.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident or reported.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk score: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is static and only defines constants and templates, there are no assumptions about dynamic behavior or external inputs that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign configuration template for release notes.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, static strings)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is entirely safe, static, and intended for documentation purposes only. It does not pose any security threat or contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.",
