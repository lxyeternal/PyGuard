  "purpose": "The code provides template and configuration constants for release notes management, including formatting templates and directory names.",
  "sources": "Constants and string templates defined within the script, including string formatting variables and directory name variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or untrusted data processing points; no user input, network communication, or data output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines static variables and a multi-line string template.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions, string templates, and directory name variables. There are no data inputs, no processing of untrusted data, no function calls, and no code execution. The template string is static and meant for documentation purposes. The absence of any dynamic or executable logic indicates no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration and template definition for release notes. It contains no executable or data-processing logic, no signs of malicious behavior, and no security concerns. The likelihood of malware or malicious intent is extremely low.",
