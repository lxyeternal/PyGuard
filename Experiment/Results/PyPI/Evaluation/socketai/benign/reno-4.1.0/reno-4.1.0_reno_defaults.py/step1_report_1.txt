{
  "purpose": "This code defines constants and template strings for release notes in a software project, including directory names, section headers, and a large formatted template for release notes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; all strings are hardcoded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or outputted in an insecure manner.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely sets string constants and a template for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists entirely of static string constants and formatting templates with no dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a configuration and template definition for release notes, with no dynamic or executable code that could be malicious. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modifications. The absence of user input handling, external data fetching, or code execution indicates no potential attack vectors or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script for release note templates. It contains no malicious code, no data leaks, and no suspicious behavior. It is safe to use.",
