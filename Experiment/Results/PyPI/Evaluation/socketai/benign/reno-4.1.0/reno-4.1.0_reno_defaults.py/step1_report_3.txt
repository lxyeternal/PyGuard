  "purpose": "Define constants and templates for release notes management in a project, including directory names, section titles, and a formatted string template for release notes.",
  "sources": "Constants and string templates that do not process external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or malicious effect are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines static constants and a static format string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward and consists solely of constant definitions and a multi-line string template.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines string constants and a large static format string for release notes, with no input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The license header is standard and non-malicious. The overall structure indicates setup for documentation purposes, not execution or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely provides constants and templates for release notes formatting. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
