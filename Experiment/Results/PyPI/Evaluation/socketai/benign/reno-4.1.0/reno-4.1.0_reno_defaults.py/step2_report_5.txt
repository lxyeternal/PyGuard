  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, consists solely of string constants, directory names, and a large multi-line template string.\n- No dynamic execution, user input handling, external data fetching, or code that could be exploited is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious instructions, or suspicious behavior.\n- The license header is standard and non-malicious.\n- The code serves as a configuration or template for release notes, with no processing or data flow that could lead to security issues.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - None of the reports identify any malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, does not perform network operations, nor execute code dynamically.\n\n2. **Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports indicate the code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Malware Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The scores assigned in each report seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n5. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; all correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- The code is purely static configuration for release notes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n- The code is safe, with no need for further security scrutiny.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis supply chain incident report is accurate. The code is benign, and there are no security concerns. It is safe to deploy and use as intended.",
