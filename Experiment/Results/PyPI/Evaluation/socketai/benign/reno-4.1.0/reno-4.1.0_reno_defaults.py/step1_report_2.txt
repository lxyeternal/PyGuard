  "purpose": "This code defines constants and a template string for release notes documentation in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Constants and string templates defined within the file, including string literals and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not process or handle untrusted data or inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely declares static constants and a template string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward documentation template setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of variable declarations and a large multi-line string template used for release notes. No input handling, external data processing, or code execution occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is static and solely for defining constants and a formatting template for release documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign static configuration and template definition file for release notes. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. The code serves its purpose as a documentation template without introducing security concerns.",
