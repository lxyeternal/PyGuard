  "purpose": "This code defines constants and a large template string for release notes, serving as a static configuration or documentation template.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, including directory names and a multi-line string template.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data flow operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and does not handle external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants and a large multi-line template string for release notes. There are no functions, dynamic code, user input handling, external data fetching, network operations, or code execution. The license header is standard. All indicators point to a static configuration file intended for documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, static, and intended for documentation. It poses no security threat, contains no malware or obfuscation, and does not introduce any security risks. The scores are correct and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
