  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of constant definitions: directory names, section headers, and a large multi-line string template for release notes.\n   - There are no functions, dynamic code, user input handling, external data processing, network operations, or code execution.\n   - The license header is standard and does not introduce any security concerns.\n   - The variables are static, hardcoded strings meant for formatting release notes.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - The code does not process or handle untrusted data.\n   - No data flows from sources to sinks; it’s purely static configuration.\n   - No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no external dependencies or network activity.\n   - The purpose is to define templates and constants for documentation, which is inherently safe.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is static, contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and is purely for configuration/documentation purposes.\n   - They consistently assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), and no anomalies or security risks are detected.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk, no dynamic behavior, no external data handling.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is static and benign, which is accurate.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified given the code's nature.\n   - No reason to increase the scores or consider obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores (all zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate.\n- The code is safe, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's static, configuration-only nature.",
