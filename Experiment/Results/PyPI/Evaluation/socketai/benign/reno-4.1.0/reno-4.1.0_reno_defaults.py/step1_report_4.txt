  "purpose": "This code defines constants and template strings for release notes documentation in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Constants for directory names, section headers, and a large format string TEMPLATE.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling is evident; the code only sets static strings and configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares string constants and a format template for release notes, with no input handling, no data processing, no network activity, or system modifications. It appears to be configuration or documentation scaffolding intended for use elsewhere. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and only involves static data.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign configuration code for release notes with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as a template and constants for documentation purposes only.",
