  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as static, consisting of constants, directory names, and a large multi-line string template for release notes.\n- No dynamic code, user input handling, external data processing, or system modifications are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The code appears to be purely for configuration and documentation purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration with no malicious or insecure behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws?**  \n  **None.** All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static nature and lack of malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk. This is justified given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since there's no code execution, no data handling, no external inputs, and no network activity, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n\n### Additional Critical Analysis:\n- The code's purpose is solely to define constants and a template string for release notes.\n- No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The license header is standard and non-malicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are necessary; the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely static configuration with no dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling. It cannot be exploited or used maliciously in its current form.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
