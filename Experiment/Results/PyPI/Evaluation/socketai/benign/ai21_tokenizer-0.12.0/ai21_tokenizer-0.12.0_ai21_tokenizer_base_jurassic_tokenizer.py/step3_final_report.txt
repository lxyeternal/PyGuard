  "purpose": "Implementation of a base class for a SentencePiece tokenizer, handling configuration, model loading, tokenization, encoding, and decoding processes.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, model files, input text, external utils for JSON loading and number detection.",
  "sinks": "In-memory token lists, text output, no external network or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Configuration and model loading → Tokenization and encoding → Post-processing → Decoding to text.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured tokenizer class that manages configuration, model files, and text processing. It uses standard libraries and external utils without any signs of malicious behavior. No network calls, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The functions are typical for NLP tokenizers, with proper validation and handling of special tokens. No suspicious data flows or external data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a SentencePiece tokenizer with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to configuration and file handling, which are normal for such modules.",
