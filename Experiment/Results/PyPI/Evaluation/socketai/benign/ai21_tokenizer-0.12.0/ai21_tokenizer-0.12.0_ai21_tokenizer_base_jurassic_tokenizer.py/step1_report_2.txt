{
  "purpose": "The code implements a tokenizer class for processing text using SentencePiece models, supporting configuration-based tokenization modes, and handling special tokens and spacing.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration files (config.json), model files (e.g., .model), and accepts input text for tokenization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present; the code does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input text flows through _encode and _decode methods; configuration is loaded from JSON files; model files are read from disk; token IDs are mapped to tokens and vice versa.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code relies on external libraries such as sentencepiece and custom utils, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. No dynamic execution or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a tokenizer, with functions for encoding, decoding, and handling special modes for numbers and spaces. It loads configurations and models securely, using standard file handling and JSON loading. No signs of malicious payloads, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The only notable aspect is its support for multiple tokenization modes and handling of special tokens, which are typical for such implementations. The use of external libraries and helper functions appears benign. Overall, the code’s structure and content do not suggest malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate tokenizer implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected functions securely and does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or malware indicators.",
