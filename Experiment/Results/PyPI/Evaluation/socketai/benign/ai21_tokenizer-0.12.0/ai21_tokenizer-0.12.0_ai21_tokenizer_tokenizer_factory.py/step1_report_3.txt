{
  "purpose": "The code is a factory module for creating different AI21 tokenizers, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous creation, with support for local resources and environment-based cache directories.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (_ENV_CACHE_DIR_KEY), file path references (_LOCAL_RESOURCES_PATH), and function parameters (tokenizer_name).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks detected; paths and environment variables are used for configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and parameters influence cache directory paths and model paths, directing tokenizer instantiation. No untrusted data flows into insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code manages file paths and environment variables in a standard manner. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data via environment variables and local paths, constructs paths dynamically, and creates tokenizer instances accordingly. All operations adhere to standard security practices without apparent malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The functions appear to securely manage paths and parameters, with proper error handling for unsupported tokenizers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate factory module for tokenizer creation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages paths and environment configurations without exposing sensitive data or executing malicious operations.",
