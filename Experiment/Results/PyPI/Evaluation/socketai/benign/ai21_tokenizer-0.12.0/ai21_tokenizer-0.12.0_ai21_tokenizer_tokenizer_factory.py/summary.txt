  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured factory pattern for tokenizer creation with minimal security concerns. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary risk stems from environment variable reliance, which is a common configuration practice but should be managed securely. Overall, the code is safe in trusted environments; monitoring environment control is recommended for sensitive deployments."
