{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module that imports specific classes, constants, and version information from submodules within the 'ai21_tokenizer' package and a local version module, then exposes them via __all__ for public API access.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'ai21_tokenizer' submodules and local 'version' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable assignments; no dynamic data flow or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, static, and conventional for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module, likely __init__.py, that imports classes and constants for API exposure. It contains no functions, dynamic code, or data processing. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup module with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
