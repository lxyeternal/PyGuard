{
  "purpose": "This code imports various tokenizer classes and constants, and sets up the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from ai21_tokenizer package modules and a local version variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The use of version import is standard. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static imports of classes and variables from the ai21_tokenizer package and a local version file. It defines the module's __all__ list for public API exposure. No user input handling, data processing, or network operations are involved. The structure and content are straightforward, typical for an __init__.py file or package entry point. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup script importing components and defining the public API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
