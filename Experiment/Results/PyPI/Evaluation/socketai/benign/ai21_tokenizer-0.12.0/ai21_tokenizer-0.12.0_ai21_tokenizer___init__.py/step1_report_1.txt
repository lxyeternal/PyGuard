{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import module for a Python package related to tokenizers, defining and exporting various tokenizer classes and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ai21_tokenizer submodules and local version module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing points are present; this code only imports and exports classes and variables",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code does not handle runtime data or user input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and export statements with no complex logic or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and variables from external tokenizer modules and a local version file. It then defines a __version__ variable and an __all__ list for exports. There are no function definitions, no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no suspicious code constructs. The code is standard for a package's __init__.py or module export file, primarily serving to organize and expose components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import/export setup with no signs of malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and no security risks identified. It is a typical pattern for Python packages to manage public API exposure.",
