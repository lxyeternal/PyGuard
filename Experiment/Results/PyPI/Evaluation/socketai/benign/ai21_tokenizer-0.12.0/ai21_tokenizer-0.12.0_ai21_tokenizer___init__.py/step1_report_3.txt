{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API of a Python package related to tokenizers, importing various tokenizer classes and setting package version info.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ai21_tokenizer modules and local version import",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input, output, or handling that could lead to security issues",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks present in this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward import and export statements, no dynamic execution, no credentials or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports several classes from the ai21_tokenizer package and a version identifier. It then defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated code. No external data sources or sink points exist. The code is static, clean, and serves as an API aggregator.",
  "conclusion": "This module simply re-exports imported classes and version info, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It appears to be a standard public API interface setup.",
