  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It consists solely of import statements from the `ai21_tokenizer` package modules and a local `version` module.\n- It defines a `__version__` variable and an `__all__` list to specify the public API.\n- There are no functions, no dynamic code, no data processing, and no user input handling.\n- The code appears to be a typical `__init__.py` or module export file for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. This aligns with the actual code content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a standard module setup file with no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data handling. It only imports classes and variables. The malware score should remain **0**.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  No obfuscation techniques are used; the code is straightforward. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the above, the overall security risk should be **0**.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not make any unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that this code is purely structural and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard module for exposing classes and constants.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should not be changed.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
