{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import and export module for various tokenizer classes and version information related to the ai21_tokenizer library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ai21_tokenizer package and local version module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious behavior. The code simply organizes and exports imported classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several tokenizer classes and functions from the ai21_tokenizer package, then defines a version variable and an __all__ list for module exports. All operations are static imports and variable assignments without any dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module import/export script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply organizes and exposes components for use elsewhere.",
