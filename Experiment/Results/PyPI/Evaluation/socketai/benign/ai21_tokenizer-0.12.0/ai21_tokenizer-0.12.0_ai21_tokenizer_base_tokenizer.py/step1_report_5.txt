  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for synchronous and asynchronous tokenizers, establishing interfaces for encoding, decoding, and token conversions.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class/method definitions. No external input sources or data reads detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, untrusted data flows, or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly defines interfaces with no executable logic or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed. The async method uses run_in_executor but does not specify any callback function or external code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of abstract base classes for tokenizers, specifying method signatures for encoding, decoding, token-ID conversions, and vocab size. The AsyncBaseTokenizer includes an async method for making executor calls, but it simply awaits a lambda that calls the provided function. No concrete implementations or executable code are present. The use of run_in_executor with a lambda wrapping a callback function is standard for asynchronous execution, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. There are no inputs, outputs, network calls, or data leaks. The code is purely structural, defining interfaces.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining abstract interfaces for tokenizers. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The async method setup is standard and harmless.",
