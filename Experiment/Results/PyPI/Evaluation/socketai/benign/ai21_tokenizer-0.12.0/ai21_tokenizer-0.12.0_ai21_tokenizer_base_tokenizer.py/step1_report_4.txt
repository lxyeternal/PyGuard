  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for synchronous and asynchronous tokenizers with standard methods for encoding, decoding, and token ID conversions.",
  "sources": "No input sources or external data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output mechanisms to untrusted destinations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines interfaces.",
  "anomalies": "The method _make_async_call uses run_in_executor with a lambda that calls a callback function with kwargs, which could potentially be exploited if callback_func is malicious or untrusted, but as an interface, this is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract classes for tokenization operations with standard methods. It includes an asynchronous helper method that runs a callback in an executor. The design appears standard for tokenization interfaces. No data input/output points, network connections, or suspicious logic are evident. The use of run_in_executor with a lambda that calls callback_func is a common pattern but requires careful implementation to avoid security issues if callback_func is untrusted; however, as part of an interface, it doesn't pose an immediate threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily defines interfaces for tokenizers without any implementation. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious functionality. The only minor consideration is the asynchronous call method, which depends on external functions for potential security risks, but as an interface, it is not inherently malicious.",
