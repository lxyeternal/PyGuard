  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely interface definitions for tokenizer classes, with no actual logic or data processing.\n- No external data, network activity, or execution of untrusted code occurs.\n- The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the `_make_async_call` method, which uses `run_in_executor` to run a callback function asynchronously.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is just interface definitions, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is safe, with no signs of malware or security issues.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.\n- **Note:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is standard interface code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No problems.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, noting that `_make_async_call` uses `run_in_executor` with a lambda that calls `callback_func`.\n- **Potential concern:** If `callback_func` is malicious or untrusted, this could be exploited, but as an interface, this is not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 — seems reasonable given the potential for misuse if `callback_func` is untrusted.\n- **Justification:** The report appropriately flags the minor risk but correctly notes that as an interface, it doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, notes that the code is purely structural, with no executable logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports agree that the code is purely interface definitions with no actual logic, data handling, or network activity.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very minimal, mainly the cautious note about `run_in_executor` usage if callback functions are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n**Scores I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code is purely structural, with negligible security risk.\n- **Justification:** The code only defines interfaces and a helper method for async execution; no actual data processing, external communication, or code execution occurs.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, standard interface code with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only minor consideration is the `_make_async_call` method, which could pose a risk if used improperly with untrusted callbacks, but as an interface, this is not an immediate concern.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's nature.",
