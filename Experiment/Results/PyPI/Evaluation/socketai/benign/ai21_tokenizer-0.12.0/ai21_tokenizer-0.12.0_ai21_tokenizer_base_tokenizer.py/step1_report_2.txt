  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for synchronous and asynchronous tokenizers, specifying interfaces for encoding, decoding, and token conversion operations.",
  "sources": "Imports (asyncio, abc, typing); class and method definitions; abstract methods with docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—no data flows or source-to-sink paths in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a standard interface definition with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract class definitions specifying method signatures and docstrings for tokenizers. It does not implement any logic that could be malicious. The asynchronous method '_make_async_call' utilizes 'run_in_executor' with a lambda to execute provided functions asynchronously, which is a common pattern. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is clean, standard, and focuses on defining interfaces, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a straightforward, standard interface specification for tokenizer classes with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security or privacy.",
