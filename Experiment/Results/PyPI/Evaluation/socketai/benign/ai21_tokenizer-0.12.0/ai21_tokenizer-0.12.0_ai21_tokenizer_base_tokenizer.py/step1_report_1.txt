{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes for synchronous and asynchronous tokenizers, specifying methods for encoding, decoding, and token-ID conversions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for asyncio, abc, and typing modules; class method definitions; property definitions; async method for making non-blocking calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output points or external network connections; no data leaks or malicious commands evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable — abstract method definitions serve as interface specifications without actual data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns; code appears to be standard interface definitions with no logic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base classes for tokenizers, outlining method signatures for encoding, decoding, token conversion, and vocabulary size. It includes an asynchronous helper method for executing callback functions in a non-blocking manner. No code executes actual logic or handles external input; it strictly specifies interfaces. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides interface definitions for tokenizer classes, with no executable or network-related behavior, and does not contain malicious or suspicious code. It appears to be safe and standard for defining tokenizer interfaces.",
