  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading JSON and binary files, both synchronously and asynchronously, with safe path handling.",
  "sources": "File paths provided to load_json, load_binary, aload_binary, aread_file_handle functions.",
  "sinks": "File read operations; no untrusted data processing or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input file paths are converted to Path objects, then files are opened and read; async functions use await and run_in_executor for non-blocking IO.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, employing standard libraries and practices for file I/O. It performs path conversion, safe file opening, and reading, both synchronously and asynchronously. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of run_in_executor and anyio's open_file are appropriate for non-blocking operations. No external data handling, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The code's simplicity and adherence to best practices suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for file loading with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk around 0.1-0.2—are justified and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.",
