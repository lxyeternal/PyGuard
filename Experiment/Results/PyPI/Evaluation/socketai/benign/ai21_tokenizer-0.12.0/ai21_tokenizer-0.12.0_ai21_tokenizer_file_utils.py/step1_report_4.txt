  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading JSON and binary data from files, both synchronously and asynchronously.",
  "sources": "File path inputs to load_json, load_binary, aload_binary, and aread_file_handle functions.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations that handle data read from file handles or paths.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> open file -> read data -> return data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward file reading functionalities with asynchronous support. It converts paths from strings or Path objects, reads files synchronously and asynchronously, and raises errors for invalid input. No user input handling beyond file paths; no external data sources or network activity. No suspicious or malicious code detected. The functions perform standard I/O operations typical for file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for file loading with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated malicious code.",
