  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading JSON and binary files asynchronously or synchronously, with type conversions and input validation.",
  "sources": "File path inputs received by load_json, load_binary, aload_binary functions.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations that access disk data; no untrusted external data used directly in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "File path inputs -> _str_to_path -> file.open() / open_file() -> reading data from files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of run_in_executor for file handle reading is standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or hidden data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions to load JSON and binary data from specified paths, with asynchronous support for binary files. Input paths are converted to Path objects, then files are opened and read. No external data is injected, nor are there suspicious patterns such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious control flows. The use of run_in_executor for file handle reading is typical for non-blocking IO. No anomalies or malicious constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign set of file I/O utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard file reading operations safely without handling untrusted data directly, and there are no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
