  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading JSON and binary files, including asynchronous file reading.",
  "sources": "User provides file_path arguments for load_json, load_binary, aload_binary functions; input can be string or Path objects.",
  "sinks": "Reading from file handles, file paths leading to disk I/O.",
  "flows": "File path input -> file opening -> data read -> returned data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of asyncio and anyio appears standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward file loading utilities: load_json and load_binary read data synchronously; aload_binary reads asynchronously using anyio; aread_file_handle reads from an open file handle asynchronously. The function _str_to_path converts strings to Path objects safely. No user input is processed insecurely; file data is read directly from disk without manipulation. No network activity, credential handling, or sensitive data processing occurs. The code appears to be standard file I/O utilities with proper async support, without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard file handling utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. No malware indicators or security issues are present.",
