  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading JSON, binary files, and reading file handles asynchronously.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as input to load_json, load_binary, aload_binary, and _str_to_path functions.",
  "sinks": "Reading from file handles and files; no untrusted data sinks like network or database operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input file paths are converted and used to read files; file contents are returned directly. No flow from untrusted input to insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. Usage of run_in_executor is standard for async file reading. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to load JSON and binary data from files, both synchronously and asynchronously. It includes input validation and conversion of paths. The asynchronous file reading employs standard libraries with no malicious intent. No external network operations or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions perform safe file I/O with proper handling and do not contain hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of utility functions for file operations with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for typical file handling tasks.",
