{
  "purpose": "A simple script that imports and executes a main function from the dargs.cli module.",
  "sources": "The script reads the __name__ variable and imports the main function from dargs.cli.",
  "sinks": "The main() function call is a potential sink, but without inspecting its implementation, its impact cannot be determined.",
  "flows": "The script flows from importing main to executing main() when run as __main__.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports the __future__ annotations for compatibility, then imports main from dargs.cli, and executes main() if the script is run directly. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The only potential concern is the call to main(), which depends on the implementation of dargs.cli, but that is outside the scope of this code fragment. No obfuscation or malware signals are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic, non-malicious script that simply runs the main function from an external library. Without inspecting dargs.cli, there are no indications of malicious behavior within this code snippet.",
