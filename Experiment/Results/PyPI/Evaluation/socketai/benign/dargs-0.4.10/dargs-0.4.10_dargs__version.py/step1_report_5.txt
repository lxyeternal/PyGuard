{
  "purpose": "Declare the package version information generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string assignment (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment of version information.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains comments indicating it is auto-generated and should not be modified or tracked.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only defining version variables with hardcoded values. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. It appears to be a standard version declaration generated by setuptools_scm. The comments clarify that this file is auto-generated and should not be modified or tracked in version control, which is typical for version management files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare version information for the package. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security issues identified.",
