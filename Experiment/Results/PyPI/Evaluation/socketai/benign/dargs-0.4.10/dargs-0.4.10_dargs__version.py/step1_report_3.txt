  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Comments indicate auto-generated code that should not be modified or tracked; no suspicious code or behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns static version information to variables, with comments indicating it was generated by setuptools_scm. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are used. The structure is simple and standard for version files. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or data leakage. The code serves a straightforward purpose without any potential malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration for a Python package. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard version file.",
