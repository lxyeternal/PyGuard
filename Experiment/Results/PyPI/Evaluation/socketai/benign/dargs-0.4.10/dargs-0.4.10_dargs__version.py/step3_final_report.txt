  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm, serving as metadata without any dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and version tuple variables",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments with no data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated version declaration with comments indicating its origin",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of version variables, generated by setuptools_scm, with no functions, inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The comments confirm its auto-generated nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with its benign, metadata-only purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
