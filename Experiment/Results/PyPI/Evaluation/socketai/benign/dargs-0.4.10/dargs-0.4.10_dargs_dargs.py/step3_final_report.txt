  "purpose": "A comprehensive argument management framework for defining, validating, normalizing, and documenting nested argument schemas, including support for variants and repeated fields.",
  "sources": "Reads argument definitions, nested dictionaries, class attributes, and input data for validation and normalization.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures during validation, normalization, and documentation generation; no external system or network calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through validation and normalization functions, with internal modifications and serialization, without external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured utility for argument schema management, employing runtime type validation (`typeguard`), data normalization, and documentation generation. It operates solely on data structures, with no network, file, or system modifications. The extensive validation routines and normalization functions are standard for such frameworks. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured argument validation and documentation utility with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
