{
  "purpose": "Define a function that returns a list of Argument objects for command-line argument parsing or configuration.",
  "sources": "Input source is the function call to 'test_arguments' which constructs Argument objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the function merely creates and returns Argument objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of __future__ import and type annotations are standard. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function returning a static list of Argument objects. It imports standard typing and a third-party Argument class, likely used for argument parsing. No data input, external network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The code is straightforward and appears purely for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely constructs and returns a static list of Argument instances for typical application use.",
