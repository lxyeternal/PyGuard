  "purpose": "Define a list of command-line argument configurations using the Argument class.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it constructs static Argument objects within the function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows; the code does not process external data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only creates and returns a list of Argument objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines a function returning a static list of Argument instances with various configurations, and exposes it via __all__. It performs no dynamic execution, external data handling, or network activity. The code's purpose appears to be configuration setup for command-line arguments. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. All reports correctly assess the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence. The code is straightforward, static, and serves a typical configuration role.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for defining command-line arguments with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
