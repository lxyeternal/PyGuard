  "purpose": "Define and return a list of Argument objects for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided directly via code variables; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data leaks or unsafe operations observed.",
  "flows": "No flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; data is statically defined within the function.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, with no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. Uses standard type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports from future annotations for forward compatibility, imports List from typing, and a class Argument from an external library. The function test_arguments() returns a list of Argument instances with clearly defined parameters and documentation. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or suspicious patterns are present. The __all__ declaration exposes the function for external use. Overall, the code appears to be a standard test setup for argument handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and purpose-driven for defining test arguments. No malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks detected.",
