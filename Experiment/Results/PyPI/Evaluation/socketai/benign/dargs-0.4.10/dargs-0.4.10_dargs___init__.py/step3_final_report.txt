  "purpose": "Export classes Argument, Variant, and ArgumentEncoder for external use in the package.",
  "sources": "Import from the local module `.dargs`.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Import from `.dargs` directly leads to the exported classes in `__all__`.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports specific classes from a local module and declares them in `__all__`. It contains no data processing, network activity, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. The import from a relative module is standard for package internal structure. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no malicious or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
