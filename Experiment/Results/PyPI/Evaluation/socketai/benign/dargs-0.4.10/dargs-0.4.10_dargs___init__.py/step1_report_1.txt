  "purpose": "This code defines exports for the module, exposing classes Argument, Variant, and ArgumentEncoder.",
  "sources": "The source of data appears to be the imported module .dargs, which provides the classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted; the code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this snippet; it's a simple import and export definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a local module .dargs and specifies these as part of the public API via __all__. There is no data processing, user input handling, or external network activity. The code structure is standard for a module's public API definition. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export statement with no malicious or security-related issues. It appears safe and normal.",
