  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a minimal module that imports classes from a local module `.dargs` and declares them in `__all__`.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, no external inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code and its issues:\n- The code snippet is simple: a future import, an import from `.dargs`, and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious logic are present in this code.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that this code is a standard module export pattern with no suspicious elements.\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning or summaries.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct; there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Any claims based on assumptions?\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is just a module export pattern with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, the scores seem accurate and justified.** The code is safe, benign, and typical for a Python package's module initialization.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with all the reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
