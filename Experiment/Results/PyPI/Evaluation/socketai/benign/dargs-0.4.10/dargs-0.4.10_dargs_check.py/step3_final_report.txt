  "purpose": "Validate and normalize input data using external Argument class methods.",
  "sources": "Input data dict, Argument object(s) (arginfo), external methods normalize_value and check_value.",
  "sinks": "Methods normalize_value and check_value potentially process data; no direct sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dict to normalize_value, then to check_value, with external Argument object handling the processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation wrapper with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper that converts arginfo into an Argument object if needed, then calls normalize_value and check_value. It relies on external methods whose implementations are unknown but assumed safe. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores from reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are consistent with the code's simplicity and external dependency assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, straightforward, and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external methods, which are presumed safe. No evidence suggests malicious activity or security issues.",
