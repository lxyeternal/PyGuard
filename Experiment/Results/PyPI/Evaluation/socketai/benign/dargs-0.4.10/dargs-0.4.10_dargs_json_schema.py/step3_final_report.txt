  "purpose": "Generate JSON schema from a given dargs.Argument.",
  "sources": "Attributes of the Argument object, including name, doc, dtype, default, sub_fields, sub_variants, repeat.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary representing the JSON schema; no external system calls or file operations are performed within core functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Argument attributes through conversion functions to produce a JSON schema dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that converts Argument metadata into a JSON schema. It relies solely on internal attributes, performs type conversions based on standard Python types, and handles nested structures with conditional schemas. No external data, network activity, or code injection is present. The type conversion function raises an error on unsupported types, which is a safe and expected behavior. Overall, the implementation is clear, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for generating JSON schemas from argument definitions. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The low security risk score assigned in the reports is justified, and the code can be considered safe for use in schema generation tasks.",
