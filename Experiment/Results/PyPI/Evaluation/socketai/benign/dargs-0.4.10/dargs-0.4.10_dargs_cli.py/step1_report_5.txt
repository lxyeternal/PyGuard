  "purpose": "The code defines a command-line interface for checking JSON data against specified argument definitions using dynamically imported functions.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data from files or stdin; dynamic import of modules based on user-provided function string.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules and attributes; JSON data loading; error handling and printing.",
  "flows": "User provides function string -> module imported -> function object retrieved -> JSON data loaded -> check function called with data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import with user-provided module and attribute names, which could lead to importing malicious or unintended modules if input is compromised. No explicit input validation on 'func' parameter. No evidence of obfuscated code or malicious payloads within the provided code.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a CLI for checking JSON files against argument definitions. It imports modules dynamically based on user input, which could be risky if the input is malicious, but this is expected for such a utility. It loads JSON data from files or stdin and calls a 'check' function from the dynamically imported module. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, and no malicious code are present. The core risk lies in the dynamic import mechanism, which, if exploited, could run malicious code from compromised modules. However, within this code, there is no malicious payload or behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for JSON validation with dynamic module import. While dynamic imports pose a potential security concern if user input is untrusted, there is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior within this code itself. The main security concern is the risk associated with importing arbitrary modules, which is inherent in such designs but not malicious by itself.",
