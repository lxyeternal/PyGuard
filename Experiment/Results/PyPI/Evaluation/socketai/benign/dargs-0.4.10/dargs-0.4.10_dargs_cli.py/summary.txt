  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility with a known pattern of dynamic import that introduces some risk if inputs are malicious. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation is present. The security risk score should remain low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting the potential for misuse but not malicious activity. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code is safe for controlled environments, with typical caveats regarding dynamic imports based on user input."
