{
  "purpose": "Data models, enums, and classes for device management and sensor handling, primarily for internal data representation.",
  "sources": "Dictionary inputs during object initialization, setting attributes from provided data structures.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network calls, or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class attributes; no external sinks or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, license comment benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions, enums, and attribute assignments from dictionaries. No external communication, no suspicious patterns, and no obfuscation are present. The license comment and contact email are benign. The structure indicates a data modeling layer without malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data model implementation for device and sensor management. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The overall assessment confirms it is safe for use.",
