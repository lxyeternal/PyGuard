{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for constructing payloads, signing requests, and managing device capabilities for IoT devices and APIs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as access tokens, device identifiers, property keys, and external constants/functions; current time for nonces and timestamps.",
  "sinks": "Payload dictionaries used for API requests; no direct network or data exfiltration within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., access tokens, device info) flows into payload structures, which are then signed or prepared for transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets beyond external constants, or obfuscation detected. Use of time.time() for nonces is standard but predictable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of straightforward utility functions for creating payloads, signatures, and device property management. It uses standard practices such as timestamps and external cryptographic functions. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. External functions like 'ford_create_signature' are assumed secure. The use of time-based nonces is typical, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The code's structure and purpose align with legitimate device communication and management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. All signals indicate a low security risk, with malware score 0 and obfuscated score 0. The overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard practices for such utility modules. No modifications are necessary.",
