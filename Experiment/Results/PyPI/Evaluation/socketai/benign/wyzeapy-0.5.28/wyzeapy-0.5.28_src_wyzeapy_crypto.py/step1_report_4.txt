{
  "purpose": "The code generates cryptographic signatures for API authentication or request validation, specifically for 'olive' and 'ford' services.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: payloads (dict or str), access_token, url_path, request_method. Reads from function arguments and imported constants.",
  "sinks": "Uses hashlib.md5 and hmac.new to generate hashes, which are safe cryptographic functions in this context. No data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input payloads and tokens are processed, concatenated into strings, hashed, and the results returned as signatures.",
  "anomalies": "The use of MD5 hashing is considered insecure for cryptographic purposes. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. The code appears straightforward and typical for signature generation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs signature strings by sorting input data and concatenating with secrets or tokens, then hashes these strings using MD5. It performs expected operations for API request signing. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors is evident. The only concern is reliance on MD5, which is cryptographically weak but not malicious per se. No suspicious external calls or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended for signature creation using MD5 hashing. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Security risk is low but the use of MD5 should be noted as a security weakness. No signs of sabotage or malicious intent are observed.",
