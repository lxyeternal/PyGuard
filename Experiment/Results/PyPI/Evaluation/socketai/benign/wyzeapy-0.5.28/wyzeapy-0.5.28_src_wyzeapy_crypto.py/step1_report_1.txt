  "purpose": "The code generates cryptographic signatures for API request validation for two different services, Olive and Ford.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: payload (dict or str), access_token, url_path, request_method, payload (dict).",
  "sinks": "Hash functions (hashlib.md5), HMAC signatures, and URL encoding functions that process the data for signature generation.",
  "flows": "Input data (payload, access_token, url_path, request_method) is processed and combined into strings, then hashed using MD5 and HMAC with secret keys to produce signatures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of MD5 for cryptographic signing (considered insecure), potential lack of input validation, and the construction of signatures may be predictable if secrets are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs signatures by concatenating sorted payload data with secret keys, then hashing with MD5. While this may align with certain API signature schemes, MD5 is cryptographically weak and susceptible to collision attacks, raising security concerns. The payload handling appears straightforward, with no evident malicious behavior or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials are visible; secrets are imported from a constants module. There are no indications of malware or malicious intent. The overall design is typical for signature generation but uses outdated hashing algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as intended for creating API signatures but employs insecure cryptographic algorithms (MD5). It does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage, but the reliance on MD5 presents security risks. No malicious activity or malware is evident.",
