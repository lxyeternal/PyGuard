  "purpose": "Generate signatures for API authentication using secret keys and request data.",

  "sinks": "Hash functions (md5, hmac) for signature generation, potential exposure if secrets are compromised.",
  "flows": "Input data -> Signature creation functions -> Hashing and encoding -> Signature output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of MD5 hashing, which is considered weak for security purposes; no hardcoded secrets observed; secret keys are imported from external constants.",
  "analysis": "The code computes signatures for API requests, which is common for authentication. The 'olive_create_signature' function hashes a combined access token and secret with MD5, then uses HMAC with MD5, which is outdated and insecure for cryptographic purposes. The 'ford_create_signature' function creates a string with sorted payload data, appends a secret, URL-encodes it, and hashes with MD5. No hardcoded credentials are present; secrets are imported. No malicious behavior like data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is detected. The use of MD5 is a security concern but does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be standard signature generation with outdated hashing algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard request signing but uses insecure MD5 hashing, which is a security risk. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code's purpose is benign, with no evidence of malware. The security risk is moderate due to weak hashing algorithms, but this alone does not suggest malicious intent.",
