  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a software system.",
  "sources": "Code does not read any external input or data; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only declares exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are observed; all classes are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, mostly for handling errors related to device actions, parameter validation, authentication, and API interactions. The only class with additional logic is ActionNotSupported, which constructs an error message dynamically. All classes are standard and do not perform any malicious activities or contain suspicious patterns. There are no external data inputs, data leaks, or malicious code behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
