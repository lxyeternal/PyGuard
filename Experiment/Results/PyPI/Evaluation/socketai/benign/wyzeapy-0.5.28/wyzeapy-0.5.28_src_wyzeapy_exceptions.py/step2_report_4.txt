  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes, mostly for error handling related to device actions, API errors, parameter validation, authentication, etc.\n   - The only class with any logic beyond a simple pass-through is `ActionNotSupported`, which constructs an error message using a device_type parameter.\n   - The code includes a license comment with contact info, but no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external communication.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of malicious activity such as code injection, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.\n   - No external data handling, network calls, or data leaks.\n   - The exception classes are straightforward, standard practice in Python applications.\n\n3. **Obfuscation and Anomalies:**\n   - No obfuscated code patterns.\n   - No suspicious anomalies detected.\n   - License comment includes contact info, which is common and not suspicious.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n   - **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n   - The only minor point is the license comment with an email address, but this is standard and does not introduce any security risk.\n   - The `ActionNotSupported` class constructs a message dynamically, but this is standard for exception classes and does not pose security issues.\n\n6. **Summary and Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a simple, standard set of exception class definitions.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code content.",
