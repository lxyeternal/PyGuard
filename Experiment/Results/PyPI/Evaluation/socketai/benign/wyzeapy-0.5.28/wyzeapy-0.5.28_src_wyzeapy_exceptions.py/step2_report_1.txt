  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is a set of straightforward custom exception class definitions with licensing comments at the top.\n- No dynamic code execution, data handling, external communications, or untrusted input processing is present.\n- The only notable detail is the construction of an error message in `ActionNotSupported`, which is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They emphasize the absence of external data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- No issues justify a risk score above 0.0. The code is purely for exception handling, with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**5. Malware Score Analysis:**\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly avoid making unfounded assumptions about vulnerabilities; they stick to the facts.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious, given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions with license comments. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as is: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.",
