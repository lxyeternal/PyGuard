  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read; exception classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow between sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only noteworthy code is the detailed message in ActionNotSupported, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes with no dynamic or external data processing. The ActionNotSupported class constructs an error message using a device_type parameter, but this is standard and does not pose any security risk. All other classes are simple pass-through exceptions without additional logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for application error handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
