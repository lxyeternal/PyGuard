  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, including device action support, parameter validation, API errors, and authentication issues.",
  "sources": "Class constructor definitions, especially the dynamic message construction in ActionNotSupported.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes, with the message in ActionNotSupported flowing from the device_type parameter to the exception message.",
  "anomalies": "Standard class definitions; the only dynamic element is the message formatting in ActionNotSupported, which is typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for custom exceptions, with a license comment. The only dynamic code is the construction of an error message in ActionNotSupported, which is standard practice. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The exception classes are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The contact info in comments does not pose a security risk. Overall, the code is a typical, safe set of exception definitions with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
