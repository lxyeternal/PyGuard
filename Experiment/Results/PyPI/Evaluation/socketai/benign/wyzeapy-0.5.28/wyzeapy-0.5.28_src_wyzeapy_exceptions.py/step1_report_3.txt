{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error scenarios in a Python application, likely related to device actions and API interactions.",
  "sources": "No external input reading; code defines exception classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only contains class definitions and exception declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no input processing, data handling, or network activity. The exception messages are straightforward, indicating errors related to device actions and API errors. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present. The license comment suggests open or proprietary usage terms, but does not impact security review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in a larger application. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated code, and poses no security risks.",
