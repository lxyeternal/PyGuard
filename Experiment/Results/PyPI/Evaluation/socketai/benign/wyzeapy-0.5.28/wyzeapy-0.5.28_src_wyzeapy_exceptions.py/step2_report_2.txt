  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a set of straightforward custom exception class definitions with license comments. No dynamic code, data handling, external calls, or malicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify that there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of suspicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature. The confidence scores are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), which is reasonable given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware scores are all zero, which is correct. No malicious activity, code injection, or hidden behaviors are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard exception definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\nThe code appears to be a standard, benign set of custom exception classes with appropriate licensing comments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
