  "sinks": "No data is processed or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this code only declares exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class declarations, including a detailed message in one class. There are no external inputs, data processing, or network interactions. No obfuscated or malicious behavior is detectable. The class 'ActionNotSupported' contains a formatted message, but this is standard practice for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward and benign set of exception class definitions for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
