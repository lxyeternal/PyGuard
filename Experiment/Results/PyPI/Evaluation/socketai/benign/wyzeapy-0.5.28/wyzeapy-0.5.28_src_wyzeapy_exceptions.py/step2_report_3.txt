  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, with a license comment at the top.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Exception messages are straightforward, with one class constructing a message dynamically, which is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports. This aligns with the code's nature—simple class definitions without any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very low, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The only minor point is the inclusion of contact info in comments, but this does not pose a security risk.\n- The dynamic message in `ActionNotSupported` is standard and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:**\n\nThis code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions, serving as part of an error handling framework. No security concerns are present.",
