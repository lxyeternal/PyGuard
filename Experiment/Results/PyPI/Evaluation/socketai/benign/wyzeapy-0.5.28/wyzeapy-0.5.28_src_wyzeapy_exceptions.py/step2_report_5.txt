  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic code, external data handling, or network activity.\n- The code is static, with no evidence of untrusted input processing or malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor point is that the detailed message in `ActionNotSupported` is standard practice and does not pose any security concern.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected, risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The code's purpose is purely to define exception classes, which is benign.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- All claims are based on static analysis; no assumptions about malicious intent are made beyond what is evident.\n- The detailed messages are standard and do not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure scores are consistent with the report**\n\n- The scores align well with the analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely static, defining exception classes with no external interactions, data processing, or suspicious patterns. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No changes to the scores are necessary. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code is standard exception handling boilerplate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.",
