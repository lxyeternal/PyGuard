  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as an API client with token management, MFA, and logging with sanitization.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that sensitive data flows into network requests and logs, with sanitization applied.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low security risk score (0.2), malware score 0, obfuscated 0, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The code appears legitimate, with proper security practices. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, describing standard token management and MFA flows.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data handling; logs are sanitized.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent with a legitimate API client, low risk, malware 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on token handling, MFA, and HTTP requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sensitive data is used in requests and logged after sanitization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Validates that the code is a standard API client with no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description of token management, MFA, and HTTP interactions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sensitive info in requests and logs, sanitized.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate API client, low security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general description, focusing on token handling and HTTP requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper sanitization before logging; no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent with a standard, legitimate SDK.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is a standard API client with proper sanitization, no obfuscation, and no malicious activity.\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and justified.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's readability.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (~0.2), justified given the nature of the code—an API client with proper security practices.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, due to logging and data handling practices but no significant vulnerabilities)\n\n**Note:** The detailed logs and sanitization routines suggest the code is designed with security in mind, and no suspicious patterns or behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears legitimate, well-structured, and secure. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's behavior.",
