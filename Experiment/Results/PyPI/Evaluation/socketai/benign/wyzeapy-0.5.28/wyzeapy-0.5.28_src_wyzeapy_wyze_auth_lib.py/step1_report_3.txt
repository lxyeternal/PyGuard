{
  "purpose": "This code appears to implement an authentication library for interacting with Wyze's API, including login, token refresh, and request handling functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters such as username, password, verification codes, and request payloads; also reads response data from API responses.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted data in HTTP request payloads, headers, and parameters; logs request and response data, including potentially sensitive information after sanitization.",
  "flows": "Input data (credentials, verification codes) flows into API request payloads, which are sent via HTTP methods; response data is processed and may update tokens or trigger exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code performs standard API authentication flows with MFA support. Logging sanitizes sensitive info, and the code structure is typical for API clients. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an async API client with login, MFA handling, token management, and request methods. It properly manages token refreshes and sanitizes logs to prevent exposing sensitive info. All data flows appear consistent with normal API client behavior. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The only notable aspect is detailed logging with sanitization, which is standard for debugging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client for Wyze's authentication system, with proper token management and MFA support. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malware indicators. The overall security risk is minimal.",
