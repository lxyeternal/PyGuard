  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the risk scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes a standard API client for Wyze, handling login, MFA, token refresh, and HTTP requests with sanitization.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** User input, environment variables, response data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity. Sanitization is used before logging.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate API client, low risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 (low, due to logs exposure potential)\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing token management, MFA, and HTTP requests.  \n- No suspicious code or network activity.  \n- Proper sanitization and standard flow.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on standard OAuth-like flows, MFA, token refresh, and request handling.  \n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.  \n- Sanitization is used.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent, legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, handling authentication, MFA, token refresh, and HTTP requests.  \n- No malicious code or obfuscation detected.  \n- Proper sanitization.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Describes a standard API client, with token management, MFA, and request handling.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.  \n- Logging uses sanitization.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code segments.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is clear, readable, with no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** All are low (0.2), which is appropriate given the nature of the code (API client with sensitive data handling but no malicious intent).\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The detailed sanitization routines and standard API handling strongly suggest this is a legitimate library.  \n- No evidence of supply chain sabotage or malicious code snippets.  \n- The network requests target legitimate endpoints, and no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 remains appropriate, considering potential log exposure if logs are not secured, but this is standard for such libraries.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided scores.** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
