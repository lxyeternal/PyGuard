{
  "purpose": "This code implements an asynchronous API client for Wyze, handling authentication, MFA, token refresh, and HTTP requests with sanitization and logging.",
  "sources": "User credentials, environment variables, response data from network requests",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, logs (after sanitization), token storage",
  "flows": "Input credentials and MFA codes flow into login and MFA request functions; responses and tokens flow into token management and refresh routines; sanitized data is logged and sent in network requests",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured async API client with standard OAuth-like flows, MFA handling, token refresh, and detailed logging with sanitization. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. Network requests target legitimate endpoints, and sensitive data is sanitized before logging. The security and malware scores are consistent with the code's behavior, indicating low risk and no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure API client for Wyze with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) and malware score (0) are appropriate. Overall, the code is safe and well-implemented.",
