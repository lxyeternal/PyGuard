{
  "purpose": "This code provides an authentication library for interacting with Wyze's API, including login, token management, and HTTP request handling with logging and sanitization.",
  "sources": "User input via username, password, and verification codes; environment variables for API keys; response data from HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external APIs; storage or logging of sensitive data; token updates; debug logs containing sanitized data.",
  "flows": "Input credentials and verification codes → HTTP requests to Wyze API endpoints → Responses processed and tokens updated → Potential sensitive data logged or sanitized during requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; consistent use of sanitization before logging; token refresh logic is standard; no apparent backdoors or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard OAuth-like client implementation for Wyze API, handling login, 2FA, token refresh, and HTTP requests with detailed debug logging. It uses secure HTTP sessions, proper token management, and sanitization of sensitive fields before logging. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. The only concern could be the detailed debug logs potentially exposing sensitive data if logs are not properly secured, but sanitization mitigates this risk. No obfuscated or malicious code found. The overall design appears consistent with legitimate API client behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and functions as an API client for Wyze with proper security considerations, including sanitization and token management. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The risk score is low.",
