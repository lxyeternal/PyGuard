  "anomalies": [
    "Presence of multiple hardcoded secrets and identifiers, which is insecure but not malicious."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration script with static secrets embedded. No network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The main security concern is the exposure risk of hardcoded secrets, which could be exploited if the code is reverse-engineered or leaked. All reports correctly identify these secrets and assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity. The risk scores vary from 0.4 to 0.7, reflecting the severity of secret exposure. The code's structure and content are clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malware or obfuscation but embeds sensitive secrets, posing a significant security risk if compromised. The malware score remains 0, and the overall security risk is moderate to high due to static secrets. The reports are accurate and consistent; the primary concern is secret management rather than malicious intent.",
