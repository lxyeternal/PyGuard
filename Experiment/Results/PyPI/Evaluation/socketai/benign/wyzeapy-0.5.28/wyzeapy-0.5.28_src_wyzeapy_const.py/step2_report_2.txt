  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. The code contains hardcoded secrets and identifiers.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No significant logical errors. The reasoning correctly identifies the security risk of hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.7 seem reasonable given the presence of secrets but no malicious activity.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The high risk is justified because hardcoded secrets can be exploited if the code is leaked or reverse-engineered.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Hardcoded API keys and secrets are present.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No. The analysis correctly notes the security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.4. The risk score is slightly lower than in Report 1, which is acceptable considering the context.\n- **Justification for risk:** The presence of secrets warrants concern, but no malicious activity is identified.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Overall:** Sound reasoning.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Similar to previous reports, secrets are hardcoded.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No. The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.6. Slightly higher risk due to multiple secrets but still within reasonable bounds.\n- **Justification for risk:** Hardcoded secrets pose security vulnerabilities.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Same pattern of hardcoded secrets.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.4. Slightly lower risk, consistent with the absence of additional secrets or sensitive data.\n- **Justification:** The security concern remains, but no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes. Hardcoded secrets and identifiers are present.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.7. Slightly higher risk due to multiple embedded secrets.\n- **Justification:** The embedded secrets are a security concern.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n- **Code validation:** All reports correctly identify the presence of hardcoded secrets and configuration constants.\n- **Malware assessment:** All reports correctly assign malware=0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly assign obfuscated=0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** The risk scores are generally proportional to the presence of secrets, with values between 0.4 and 0.7, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** Considering the repeated presence of hardcoded secrets, I would assign a **risk score of approximately 0.75**—higher than some reports due to the cumulative security risk of multiple embedded secrets.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored. The main concern is the security risk posed by static secrets, which should be managed securely, but there is no indication of malware or malicious intent in the code itself.",
