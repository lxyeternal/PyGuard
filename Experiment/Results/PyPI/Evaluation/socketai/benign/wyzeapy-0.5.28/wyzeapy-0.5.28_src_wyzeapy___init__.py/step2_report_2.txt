  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a well-structured, asynchronous SDK for Wyze device management.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The code handles sensitive data (credentials, tokens) via parameters and internal variables, with standard callback mechanisms.\n- No signs of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage are evident.\n- The code's purpose and flow are typical for such SDKs, focusing on authentication, device listing, and notification management.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Legitimate SDK, no malicious code.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2  \n- No issues found.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, standard SDK wrapper.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.1  \n- No issues found.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above, with focus on login, token, and device management.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2  \n- No issues found.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Similar, with emphasis on notification controls.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2  \n- No issues found.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Reiterates the same, standard client SDK.  \n- Confidence: 0.9  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security risk: 0.2  \n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking with the Code:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the handling of credentials and tokens but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** because there's no evidence of malicious payloads or behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay at **0** due to the code's clarity.\n- The **security risk score** can be slightly higher (around 0.2) because of the handling of sensitive data and callback mechanisms, but these are standard practices.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No modifications needed to the scores.\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (standard handling of credentials and tokens, minor potential surface area)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate SDK for Wyze device management, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should be maintained.",
