  "purpose": "An async SDK for Wyze devices managing authentication, device listing, and notifications.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for login, token refresh, callback registration, and device data retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Token handling, callback invocation, and network requests for device info and profile updates.",
  "flows": "Credentials and tokens flow from input to auth lib; callbacks are invoked upon token updates; device info fetched via service methods.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Callback registration and token management are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clear, well-structured asynchronous SDK for Wyze device management. It handles credentials, tokens, and device info securely and uses standard callback mechanisms. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or sabotage patterns are present. The token and callback handling are typical for such SDKs, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's structure and behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
