{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'cdk-nag', including package metadata and dependencies, and reads a README file for the long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file with open('README.md', encoding='utf8') as fp",
  "sinks": "The open() function and the setuptools.setup() call, which use the data collected to configure package installation",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file (source) flows into setting the 'long_description' key in kwargs, which then flows into setuptools.setup() as part of package configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The JSON string used to initialize kwargs is static and well-formed; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package metadata from a static JSON string, reads a README.md file to populate the long description, and invokes setuptools.setup() with the assembled data. There are no dynamic inputs, no code injection, or external data fetching that could be malicious. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. The JSON string appears to be a straightforward package configuration with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code simply automates package installation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely and predictably.",
