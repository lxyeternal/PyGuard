  "purpose": "This script loads package metadata from a JSON string, reads a README.md file for a long description, and sets up the package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "JSON string containing package metadata, external README.md file",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function call, which processes the package setup with provided metadata",
  "flows": "JSON string -> json.loads() -> kwargs -> open('README.md') -> read() -> kwargs['long_description'] -> setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. No external or untrusted data sources other than the README.md file, which is a typical pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes package setup parameters via JSON, then reads a README.md file to include as the long description, and finally invokes setuptools.setup() with the parameters. The process follows standard package setup procedures. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. There are no indications of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity. The code appears straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, loading package metadata from a JSON string, reading a README file, and calling setuptools.setup(). There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
