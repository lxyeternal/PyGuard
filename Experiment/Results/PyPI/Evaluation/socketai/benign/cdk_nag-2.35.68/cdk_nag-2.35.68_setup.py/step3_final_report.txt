  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script that loads package metadata from a static JSON string, reads a README.md file for description, and invokes setuptools.setup() with this data.",
  "sources": "The static JSON string containing package metadata, the README.md file read operation.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function call with package metadata, reading of README.md content.",
  "flows": "JSON string parsed into kwargs, then kwargs used in setup(); README.md content assigned to kwargs['long_description'].",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is static, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static data, no dynamic or external inputs, no code obfuscation, and no network activity. The JSON string is well-formed and contains standard package info. The file read operation is safe. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and confidence of 1. The code's behavior aligns with these assessments, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious activity or security concerns. All evidence and reports support a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
