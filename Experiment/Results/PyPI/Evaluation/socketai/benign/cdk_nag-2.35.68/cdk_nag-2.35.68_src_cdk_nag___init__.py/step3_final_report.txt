{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive framework for AWS CDK security and compliance checks, including logging, suppression management, and rule definitions. It facilitates automated security assessments of CloudFormation templates and CDK constructs.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from CDK constructs, CloudFormation resource metadata, and suppression configurations. It processes resource properties, suppression rules, and logging instructions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls for reporting, logging outputs, and suppression rule applications. However, no external network activity or data exfiltration is present in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CDK constructs and resource metadata into rule evaluation functions, which then generate logs or reports. Suppression rules influence whether violations are reported or suppressed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code uses standard patterns, jsii for cross-language compatibility, and well-defined interfaces.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured security and compliance framework for AWS CDK, with clear separation of concerns: rule application, suppression management, and logging. It employs standard practices, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert channels. The logic is straightforward, focusing on rule enforcement and reporting, and does not include any external network calls or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate security and compliance library for AWS CDK. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The implementation is transparent, well-structured, and aligns with its purpose of enforcing security best practices.",
