  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a JSII-based Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the external assembly load, which is standard but warrants source verification. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0; risk score is moderate at 0.2 due to external dependencies, aligning with supply chain considerations."
