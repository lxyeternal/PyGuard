  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:** The code performs package setup, type checking, dynamic assembly loading via jsii, and publishing. The main concern is the dynamic assembly load and the `publication.publish()` call, which could trigger external code execution or network activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code does not contain malicious code or obfuscation.\n- The dynamic assembly load (`jsii.JSIIAssembly.load`) involves executing external JSII-compiled code, which could be compromised if the source is malicious.\n- The `publication.publish()` call could trigger network operations or remote publishing, depending on implementation.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code observed)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- Risk: 0.3 (moderate, due to external assembly load and publish call)\n\n**Verdict:** The score seems reasonable. The potential risk stems from external code execution, but no actual malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:** The code initializes a package, loads a JSII assembly, and publishes. No untrusted data or suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- All operations are standard for package setup.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- External assembly loading is typical but relies on source integrity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0 (no evident security concern)\n\n**Verdict:** The score of 0 for malware and risk aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:** Similar to above, focusing on package setup, version retrieval, assembly load, and publish. The main concern is external assembly loading.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious activity or suspicious code.\n- External assembly load could be a vector if source is compromised.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (low risk due to external assembly load)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:** The code sets up a package, manages type checking, loads a JSII assembly, and publishes. No untrusted data or malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Standard package setup.\n- External assembly load is typical but could be risky if compromised.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (low, due to external assembly load)\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring appears reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:** Similar setup: package initialization, version checks, assembly load, and publish. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- External assembly load is standard but relies on source integrity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (low, external assembly load)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, mostly low (0.1-0.3), which is appropriate given the external assembly loading and publishing steps.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering external assembly loading and publishing, but no malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and justified based on the code provided. The main risk is external assembly loading, which is typical in such setups but should be monitored for source integrity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is standard for package setup involving AWS CDK and JSII, with no malicious intent. The risk is minimal but should be acknowledged due to reliance on external sources. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
