  "purpose": "Initialize package paths, perform type checking, load external JSII assembly, and publish the package.",
  "sources": "Reading __path__, importing modules, retrieving package version, loading jsii assembly, and calling publication.publish()",
  "sinks": "publication.publish() potentially triggers network activity or remote code execution; __jsii_assembly__ load may execute external code",
  "flows": "Assembly load from jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() as source, then publication.publish() as sink",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic assembly loading and publishing functions, which could be vectors if sources are compromised; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup with dynamic assembly loading via jsii and a publish call. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External assembly loading is typical in JSII-based packages but can be a supply chain risk if the source is compromised. The publish function may trigger network activity but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code's structure is straightforward, with version-dependent type checking logic, and no suspicious patterns or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a JSII-based Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main concern is the external assembly load, which is standard but warrants source verification. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0; risk score is moderate at 0.2 due to external dependencies, aligning with supply chain considerations.",
