  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code sets up package paths, imports modules, performs version checks, loads a jsii assembly, and calls `publication.publish()`. It notes the dynamic assembly loading and the publish call as potential risks but finds no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.3\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The dynamic assembly load could be risky if the source is compromised, but there's no evidence of malicious code. The publish call is standard.\n\n- **Verdict:** The risk score of 0.3 seems reasonable given the external assembly load and potential for malicious code if the source is compromised. Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code initializes a package, loads a jsii assembly, and publishes. No suspicious behavior or malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard package setup with no malicious intent. External assembly loading is typical but could be a vector if sources are compromised, yet no evidence suggests malicious activity.\n\n- **Verdict:** The zero risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on package setup, version retrieval, assembly loading, and publishing. It notes the external assembly load as a potential vector but finds no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The external assembly load is a typical pattern but could pose risks if sources are compromised. The low risk score reflects this.\n\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages module extension, version checks, loads a jsii assembly, and publishes. No untrusted data or malicious behavior is observed.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. External assembly loading is standard but always warrants caution.\n\n- **Verdict:** The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs package setup, version checks, loads a jsii assembly, and publishes. No suspicious activity or malicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The external assembly load is typical for JSII-based packages.\n\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code performs package setup, type checking, and assembly loading, which are standard operations.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 across reports, reflecting the potential risk of external assembly loading. Given the context, these are reasonable, with some conservative assessments (e.g., 0.3 in Report 1).\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.2** — External assembly loading can be a vector if sources are compromised, but no direct evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and appropriately scored. The primary concern is the external assembly load, which is standard in JSII-based packages but always warrants source verification.\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would agree with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a low-risk, non-malicious package setup with external assembly loading as a typical but cautious point.",
