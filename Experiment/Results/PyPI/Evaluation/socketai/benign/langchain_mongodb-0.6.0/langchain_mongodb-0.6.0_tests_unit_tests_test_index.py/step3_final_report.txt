  "purpose": "Pytest-based test functions for managing MongoDB indexes, including creation, dropping, updating, and status checks.",
  "sources": "Database connection via MongoClient, index functions from langchain_mongodb.index, and sleep in _wait_for_predicate.",
  "sinks": "Calls to index functions that interact with MongoDB; no untrusted data or external network activity.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke index management methods; exception handling for expected failures; sleep used in waiting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for MongoDB index operations, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses standard libraries and predictable exception handling. No external data flows or security-sensitive operations are present. The use of sleep in testing is typical. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. All signals indicate benign, controlled testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and intended for testing index management in MongoDB. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
