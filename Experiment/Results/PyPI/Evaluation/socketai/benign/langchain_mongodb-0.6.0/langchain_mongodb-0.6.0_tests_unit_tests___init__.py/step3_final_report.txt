  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network calls, dynamic eval/exec, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, dynamic code execution points, potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input flow into eval/exec or network functions, leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code evaluation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network calls, inconsistent or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity, indicating high malicious potential. Some reports correctly identify these signs, assigning high malware and obfuscation scores, while others note benign or minimal code. The reasoning aligns with the evidence: high suspicion in report 3 due to eval/exec and obfuscation, moderate suspicion in report 1, and benign assessments in reports 2, 4, and 5. Scores are consistent with the described behaviors. No false positives or overestimations are observed; the assessments are cautious and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code in report 3 demonstrates high malicious intent, with obfuscation and dynamic evaluation, warranting a malware score of 0.8 and security risk of 0.8. Other reports are appropriately scored low, reflecting their benign or limited content. Overall, the scoring is consistent and justified based on the evidence.",
