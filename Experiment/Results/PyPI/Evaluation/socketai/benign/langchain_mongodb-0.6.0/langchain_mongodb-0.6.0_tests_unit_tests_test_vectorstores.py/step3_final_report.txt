  "purpose": "Unit tests for MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch class, validating initialization, data ingestion, search functionality, and serialization within a mock environment.",
  "sources": "Mock collection data, fixtures, and in-memory data structures; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Serialization with dumps and loads for data validation; no external data sinks or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from mock collection data through search functions and serialization steps within the test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite utilizing mock objects and fixtures to validate functionality. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. Serialization steps are standard for testing purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing suite with no malicious intent or security issues. Scores are consistent with a benign, controlled test environment.",
