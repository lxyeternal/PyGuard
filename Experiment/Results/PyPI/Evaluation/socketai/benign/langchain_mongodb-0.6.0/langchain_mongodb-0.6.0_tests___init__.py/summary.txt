  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly recognize the absence of code and assign appropriate zero scores. Report 2's suspicion-based scores should be slightly reduced to reflect the lack of concrete evidence. The overall security assessment remains cautious, with a malware score of approximately 0.2, obfuscated at 0.2, and risk at 0.3, acknowledging potential but unconfirmed concerns."
