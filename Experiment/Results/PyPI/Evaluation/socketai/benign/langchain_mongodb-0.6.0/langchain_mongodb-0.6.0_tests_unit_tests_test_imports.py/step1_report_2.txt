  "purpose": "The code tests whether the __all__ variable in the langchain_mongodb module contains the expected list of exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement for __all__ from langchain_mongodb",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an assertion check",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import and test assertion with predefined list",
  "analysis": "The code imports the __all__ variable, which defines the module's public API, and asserts it matches an expected list. There are no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or other suspicious behaviors. The code serves as a simple unit test to verify module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test to verify expected exports and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
