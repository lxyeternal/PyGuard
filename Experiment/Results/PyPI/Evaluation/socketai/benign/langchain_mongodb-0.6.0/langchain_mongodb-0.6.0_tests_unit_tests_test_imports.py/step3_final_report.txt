{
  "purpose": "Verify that the __all__ attribute in the langchain_mongodb module matches the expected list of class names.",
  "sources": "Import statement for __all__ from langchain_mongodb module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs a static assertion without external data or output.",
  "flows": "Comparison of imported __all__ with the predefined EXPECTED_ALL list.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static import and assertion with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __all__ from a module and asserts it equals a predefined list, serving as a module integrity check. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscation is present. The logic is simple and correct, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, straightforward unit test verifying module exports. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
