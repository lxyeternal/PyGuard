  "purpose": "The code is designed to verify that the __all__ attribute in the langchain_mongodb module contains expected class names.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __all__ attribute from the langchain_mongodb module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data; it only compares predefined lists.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code does not involve data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and performs a simple assertion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __all__ from the langchain_mongodb module and asserts that it contains specific expected class names. The purpose is likely to ensure module exports are as intended. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code performs a simple integrity check of module contents. No external data is being processed or sent, and no code execution or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic test for module exports, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears to be a harmless integrity check.",
