{
  "purpose": "The code is a test function that verifies the contents of the __all__ list from the langchain_mongodb module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported __all__ variable and the EXPECTED_ALL list defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it only performs a comparison operation.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: the code compares EXPECTED_ALL to __all__ to ensure they match.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code performs a simple assertion without any suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports __all__ from a module, defines an expected list of exports, and asserts that the actual exports match expectations. It contains no external input handling, no data leaks, or malicious constructs. The code is minimal and purpose-specific, with no indications of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test verifying module exports, with no malicious or security concerns.",
