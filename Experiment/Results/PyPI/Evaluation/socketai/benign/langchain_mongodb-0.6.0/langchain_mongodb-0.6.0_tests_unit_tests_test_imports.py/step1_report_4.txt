  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test function verifying the contents of the __all__ list in the langchain_mongodb package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __all__ attribute from the langchain_mongodb module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or perform any data leak or external effect.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only asserts the contents of a module attribute.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and performs a simple test.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __all__ from the langchain_mongodb module and asserts that its sorted contents match a predefined list. The code is purely for testing the correctness of __all__ exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code does not execute external commands, handle untrusted input, or include obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple test verifying the module exports; it poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
