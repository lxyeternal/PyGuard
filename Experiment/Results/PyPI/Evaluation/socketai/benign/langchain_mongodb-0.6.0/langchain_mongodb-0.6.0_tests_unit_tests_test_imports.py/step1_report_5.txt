{
  "purpose": "This code is a test script that verifies the contents of the __all__ list in the langchain_mongodb package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __all__ variable imported from the langchain_mongodb package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or can lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported __all__ list to the comparison in the test_all_imports function, which asserts equality with a predefined list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports __all__ from the langchain_mongodb package and defines a test to compare its contents against an expected list. The purpose appears to be ensuring package exports are correct. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or malicious code execution. The code is simple and aligns with typical testing practices, with no security risks or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test script verifying package exports. No malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation are present.",
