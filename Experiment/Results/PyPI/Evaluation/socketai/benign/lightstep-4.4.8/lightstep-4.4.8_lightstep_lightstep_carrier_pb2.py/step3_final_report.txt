  "purpose": "Defines protobuf message schemas for Lightstep tracing data, including BinaryCarrier, BasicTracerCarrier, and TextCarrierPair.",
  "sources": "No data input; only message class definitions and descriptors.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard auto-generated protobuf code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated protobuf schema definitions for tracing data, with no dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. It contains message descriptors and class registrations, which are standard and benign. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is structural, used for serialization/deserialization of tracing information, and it does not perform any runtime operations or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated protobuf schema file with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat, contains no obfuscation, and is safe for supply chain use.",
