  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'lightstep' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the setup() function parameters, including dependencies in 'install_requires' and 'tests_require'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; setup configuration is static and standard.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; dependencies are specified as static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The setup script is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and uses setup() to specify package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. All dependencies and metadata appear standard and safe. No signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is typical for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard package configuration code with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It properly defines dependencies and metadata without any suspicious or anomalous code.",
