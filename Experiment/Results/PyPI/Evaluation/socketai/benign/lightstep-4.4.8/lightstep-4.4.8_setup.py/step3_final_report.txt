{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata and dependencies for the 'lightstep' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings and lists defining package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, test requirements, classifiers, keywords, and package inclusion/exclusion patterns.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a standard setup script with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script utilizing setuptools for package configuration. It contains static metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion rules. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. Dependencies are common open-source packages with specified version constraints. The code's structure and content are typical for Python packaging and show no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence (1.0). The scores are consistent with the static, non-malicious nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the package can be considered safe for use.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
