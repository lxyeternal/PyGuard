  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, static setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling is present.\n- Dependencies are common, well-known packages with version restrictions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are detected.\n- The code is benign and follows typical packaging conventions.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1.0\n\nThese are consistent with the analysis. Since the code is purely static configuration with no suspicious elements, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or points to challenge:**\n- No issues are present in the code or analysis.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made without basis.\n- The dependencies are standard; no signs of malicious packages or hidden payloads.\n\n**Risk score justification:**\n- The highest concern might be the presence of dependencies, but since they are all reputable packages, the risk remains negligible.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, given the code clarity.\n- The overall security risk is 0, aligning with the benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- The code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- risk: 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The security risk is negligible.\n- The confidence in these assessments is high.\n\n**Final note:** The consistent, thorough analysis confirms that this package setup code is safe and typical.",
