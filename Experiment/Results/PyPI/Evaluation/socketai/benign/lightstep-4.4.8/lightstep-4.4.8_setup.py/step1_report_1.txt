  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'lightstep' Python package including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Code reads static strings for package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; all data appears static and part of package setup.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or untrusted data flows; the code only specifies package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to specify package information, dependencies, and metadata. It contains no user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network or system operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; it follows typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
