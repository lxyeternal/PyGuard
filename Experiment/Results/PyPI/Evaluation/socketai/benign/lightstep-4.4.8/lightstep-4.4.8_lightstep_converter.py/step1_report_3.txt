  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for converting span data to wire formats for satellites.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; method parameters may include untrusted input at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leakage points in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed in this static code fragment; flow depends on implementation of abstract methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Python 2 style metaclass assignment (__metaclass__ = ABCMeta) in a class inheriting from object; no actual implementation code or data handling shown.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines an abstract class with method signatures for subclasses to implement. It does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or data flows. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or suspicious code constructs. The use of ABCMeta is a standard pattern in Python 2 for abstract classes; no obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a structural interface definition with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. It appears safe and standard for defining abstract classes.",
