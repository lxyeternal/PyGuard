  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for converting span data to wire formats for Satellites.",
  "sources": "Method signatures indicating data conversion points; no data input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; abstract methods define expected data handling without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Python 2 style '__metaclass__' syntax; no other anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. It uses outdated Python 2 syntax for metaclass declaration but does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The class serves as an interface template for subclasses to implement specific conversion logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard abstract class interface with no security threats, malware, or obfuscation. The outdated syntax is a stylistic issue, not a security concern. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
