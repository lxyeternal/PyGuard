{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract interface 'Converter' for converting span data to wire formats for Satellites, with various method signatures.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines an abstract class with method signatures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network, file, or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "No executable flows or data flows present, as this is an abstract interface with no implementations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses the deprecated 'ABCMeta' from 'abc' with the old Python 2 style '__metaclass__' assignment, but this is not malicious; just outdated syntax. No suspicious or unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines an abstract class with method signatures, serving as an interface for subclasses. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other potentially malicious activities. There are no source-to-sink data flows, no data input or output, and no implementation details that could be exploited. The usage of 'ABCMeta' with '__metaclass__' is an outdated Python 2 pattern but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class definition intended to specify an interface for span data conversion. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected. The code appears safe and non-malicious.",
