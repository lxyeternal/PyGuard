{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract interface for converting span data into wire-compatible formats for Satellites, facilitating standardized data processing.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code; abstract methods suggest data may be provided during implementation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are explicitly present; the methods imply data handling during runtime but no direct data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow or method implementations, only method signatures with parameters indicating data handling, but no execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Python 2 style metaclass declaration (__metaclass__ = ABCMeta) instead of Python 3 syntax, which is outdated but not malicious. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with multiple abstract methods intended for span data conversion. It employs Python 2 style for metaclass declaration, which is harmless but outdated. The class itself does not perform any operations, data processing, or I/O. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Usage of abstract methods indicates it's a template for subclasses, not executable logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward abstract interface with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a template for further implementation, with no suspicious or harmful elements detected.",
