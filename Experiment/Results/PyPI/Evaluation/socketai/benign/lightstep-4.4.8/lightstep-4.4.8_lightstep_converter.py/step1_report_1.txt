  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for converting span data to wire-compatible formats for Satellites.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data sourcing; the code is a class interface definition with method signatures only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; there is no data processing, output, or external communication in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines abstract method signatures without implementation or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard Python syntax for abstract classes with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class using ABCMeta to define method signatures for subclasses. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The use of abstract methods is common in interface design and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an interface template for span data conversion. It contains no executable or data-processing logic, no signs of malicious behavior, and no security risks. It is safe and normal for its intended purpose.",
