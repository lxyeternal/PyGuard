  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for converting span data to wire formats for Satellites.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; all methods are abstract and lack implementations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated __metaclass__ attribute in Python 2 style; no other unusual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class 'Converter' with several abstract methods intended for subclasses to implement. It uses ABCMeta via __metaclass__ for compatibility with Python 2, which is outdated but not malicious. There are no data inputs, outputs, or data processing within this fragment. No suspicious behaviors such as code injection, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be a standard interface definition with no embedded malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines an abstract interface for data conversion. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign component serving as a contract for subclasses.",
