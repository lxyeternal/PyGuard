{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module that imports a 'Tracer' class from a relative module 'tracer', likely for tracing or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package: 'from .tracer import Tracer'",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports a class without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, with no input reading, data processing, or suspicious constructs. It uses a relative import to include 'Tracer' from the 'tracer' module, which is standard in Python packages. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or complex control flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical of a module that provides tracing capabilities. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
