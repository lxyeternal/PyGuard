  "purpose": "Minimal import statements for setting up debugging or tracing functionality in a Python module.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from __future__ import absolute_import' and 'from .tracer import Tracer'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no external network activity, no code execution based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code only imports modules; no data flow or runtime behavior present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is straightforward and typical for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no functions, data processing, or network activity. The import of 'Tracer' suggests debugging or tracing, which is common. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal nature and standard pattern indicate a benign purpose. All signals point to a safe, non-malicious component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import for debugging or tracing purposes. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
