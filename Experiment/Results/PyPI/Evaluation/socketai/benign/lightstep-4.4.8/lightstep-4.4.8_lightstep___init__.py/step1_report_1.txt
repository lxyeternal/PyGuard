{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a module named 'Tracer' from a relative package, likely for tracing or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from __future__ and relative import of 'tracer' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing observed; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways present; only static import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of __future__ import is standard; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a __future__ import statement and a relative import of 'Tracer'. There are no input handling, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors that could indicate malicious intent. The import of 'Tracer' suggests intended functionality related to tracing or debugging, which is common in development code. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a standard module import for tracing purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
