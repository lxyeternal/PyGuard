{
  "purpose": "Establishes a thread-safe HTTP connection to a server via Thrift, used for sending reports.",
  "sources": "URL input for connection, access_token passed as a function argument, network socket for communication.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission of report data, setting custom headers with access tokens.",
  "flows": "Input URL and token -> set headers -> send report via Thrift client -> network socket.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard, thread-safe HTTP client for Thrift communication, with proper error handling and reconnection logic. It dynamically sets headers with access tokens passed as arguments, avoiding hardcoded secrets. No malicious behaviors, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident. Exception handling is appropriate, and the connection lifecycle is managed correctly. The code does not perform any suspicious actions or contain malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-structured connection manager for reporting via Thrift. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
