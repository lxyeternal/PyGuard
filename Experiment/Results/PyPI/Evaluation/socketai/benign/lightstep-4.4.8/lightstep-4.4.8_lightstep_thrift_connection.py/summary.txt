  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-structured connection manager for reporting via Thrift. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
