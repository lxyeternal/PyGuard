  "purpose": "Define a namespace for LightStep supported carrier formats, specifically for use in tracer injection and extraction.",
  "sources": "The class definition and static constants, which are hardcoded string values.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only provides static string constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no unusual or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This code defines a class with a static constant for a specific carrier format. It contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, or external data processing. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code appears to be a simple constants holder for use elsewhere in a larger tracing system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely for defining constants related to LightStep carrier formats, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
