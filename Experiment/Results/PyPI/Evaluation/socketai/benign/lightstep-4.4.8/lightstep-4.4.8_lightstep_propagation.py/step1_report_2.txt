{
  "purpose": "Defines a namespace for LightStep supported carrier formats used in tracing context injection and extraction.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reads; static string constant assignment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external connections, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class defining a string constant representing a tracing carrier format. It contains no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file interactions. The class serves as a constant namespace for use elsewhere, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious definition of a format identifier for use in tracing operations. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or anomalies detected.",
