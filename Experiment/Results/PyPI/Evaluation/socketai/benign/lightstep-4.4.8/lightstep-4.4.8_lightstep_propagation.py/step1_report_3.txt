  "purpose": "Defines a namespace class for LightStep carrier formats used in tracing inject/extract methods.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static constant declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a class for constants, no suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class defining a constant string for a specific carrier format. It contains no data input, output, or processing. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs present. The code serves as a configuration or constants namespace for use elsewhere in tracing implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a namespace for constants related to LightStep tracing formats.",
