{
  "purpose": "Defines a namespace for LightStep supported carrier formats, specifically the 'lightstep_binary' format used in tracing injection and extraction.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only declares a class constant.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only provides a static constant for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class defining a single string constant representing a carrier format. It contains no dynamic logic, data processing, or external interactions. The code serves as a namespace for constants used in tracing operations. All signals indicate benign intent, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The documentation and structure are standard for such constants. The high confidence scores (1) and zero malware/security risk scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward constants holder for a tracing format. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
