  "purpose": "Defines a namespace class for LightStep supported carrier formats used in tracing injection and extraction methods.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a simple class with a single constant string representing a carrier format. It serves as a namespace for constants used elsewhere. There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no logic that could be exploited. It references a URL for documentation, which is standard practice. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, informational namespace class defining a constant for a specific carrier format. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are present.",
