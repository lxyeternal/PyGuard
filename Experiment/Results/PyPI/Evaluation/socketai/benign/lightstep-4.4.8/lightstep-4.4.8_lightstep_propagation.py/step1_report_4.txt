{
  "purpose": "Defines a namespace class for LightStep supported carrier formats, used in tracing context injection and extraction.",
  "sources": "No input data sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs where untrusted data could be leaked or exploited.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, containing only class and constant definitions with no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature, defines a class with a descriptive docstring, and declares a constant string representing a binary format. No user input, external data, or sensitive information is handled. There are no apparent vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or anomalies. The code appears to serve as a simple configuration or constant reference for tracer operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration class defining a constant for a carrier format used in tracing. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
