  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers display functions, which write static info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Code is straightforward and solely prints static information.",
  "analysis": "The script provides CLI commands to print package info and version. It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, but only to determine whether to print version info or general info. The outputs are static, hardcoded strings, with no external data sources, network calls, or user inputs beyond argument check. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden behaviors. The code is minimal and clean, serving purely informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information. It does not contain any malicious code, malware, or security risks. Its behavior is benign and limited to displaying predefined information.",
