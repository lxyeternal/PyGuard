  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to stdout output",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025), but no malicious or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. It only outputs static information based on simple argument checks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code structure is clear and well-defined, serving an informational purpose. The only unusual aspect is the future year in the comment, which is not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0 and very low security risk scores. The code poses no security threat and is safe for use.",
