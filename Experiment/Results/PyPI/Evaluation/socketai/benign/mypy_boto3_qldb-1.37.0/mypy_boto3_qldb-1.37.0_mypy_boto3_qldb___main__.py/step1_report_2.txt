  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv). Uses sys.stdout.write to output package info and version.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via sys.stdout.write; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "User input (sys.argv) influences whether print_version or print_info is called, then outputs are written to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or malicious intent observed. The copyright year is set to 2025, which is future-dated, but this does not imply maliciousness.",
  "analysis": "The code reads command-line arguments and conditionally outputs package info or version. All outputs are benign, static strings. There are no external data fetches, no network connections, and no dynamic code execution. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward CLI utility for displaying static package information. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
