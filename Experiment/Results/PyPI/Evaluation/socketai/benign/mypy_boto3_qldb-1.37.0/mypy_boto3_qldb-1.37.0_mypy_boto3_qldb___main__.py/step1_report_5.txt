  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers output functions, which write to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code present. No suspicious behavior or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that provides package info or version details based on user input. It imports sys to access command-line arguments and output streams. The functions print_info() and print_version() only output static informational text, with no external data fetching, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The main() function conditionally calls these functions based on input arguments, which is standard behavior. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious activities. The code adheres to best practices for a simple informational CLI tool.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
