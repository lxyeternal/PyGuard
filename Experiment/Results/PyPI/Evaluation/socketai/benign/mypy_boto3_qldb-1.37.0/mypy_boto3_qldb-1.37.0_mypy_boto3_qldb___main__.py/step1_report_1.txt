  "purpose": "CLI utility for displaying package information and version details for boto3 QLDB",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), standard output (sys.stdout.write)",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout via sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in command-line input, then prints version or package info accordingly",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI tool designed to display static package information or version. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking, nor does it perform network operations, file modifications, or other potentially malicious actions. The code is straightforward, with clearly defined functions and no hidden or obfuscated logic. The license comment indicates a recent copyright date, but that is not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information or version based on command-line arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
