{
  "purpose": "Define Python type annotations for AWS QLDB service responses and requests to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, datetime, typing), type definitions, and string constants. No external data input sources are explicitly read from within this code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no network calls, file writes, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "This module primarily defines data structures; it does not contain data flow logic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility. The code only defines types and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of TypedDict class definitions for AWS QLDB API request and response structures. It employs conditional imports to ensure compatibility across Python versions, and the constants imported are likely for documentation and validation. There are no executable statements, no network or system calls, no data manipulations, and no dynamic code execution. The purpose is solely to facilitate static type checking, with no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard set of type definitions for AWS QLDB SDK interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues within this module. It functions purely as a type annotation reference, contributing to safer code development.",
