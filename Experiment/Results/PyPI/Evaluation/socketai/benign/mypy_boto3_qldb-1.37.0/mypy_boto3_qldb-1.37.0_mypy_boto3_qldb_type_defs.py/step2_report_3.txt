  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS QLDB interactions. No runtime logic, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is mainly auto-generated SDK type definitions, with conditional imports for compatibility. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code are evident.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high confidence that the code is safe.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is purely type definitions for static analysis, with no runtime or external data processing.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the use of conditional imports and standard patterns. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk scores are zero, consistent with the benign description.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — absolute certainty based on the static nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a straightforward set of type definitions for AWS QLDB, with no runtime logic or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The mention of the '2025' copyright year is unusual but not malicious; likely a placeholder or typo. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware and risk are zero, fitting the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high confidence.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the absence of external data handling, network calls, or executable code, emphasizing that the code is purely for type annotations.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code uses conditional imports for compatibility and contains no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Both zero, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — very high.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is solely for defining data schemas for AWS QLDB, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that no malicious activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- **Scores:** Both zero, fitting the benign description.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a set of static type definitions for AWS QLDB SDK, with no runtime logic, external data processing, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, as the code is purely for type safety and documentation.\n- **Potential Issues:** The only minor anomaly is the future year '2025' in the copyright statement, which is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (as per the reports, but even this is very low; perhaps 0.0 would be more appropriate given the benign nature)\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n**The code is a standard, auto-generated set of type annotations and data schemas for AWS QLDB SDK interactions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (or at most 0.1 for the placeholder year, but practically negligible)\n\nThis analysis confirms the reports' assessments and indicates no security concerns.",
