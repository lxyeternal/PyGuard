{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for the AWS QLDB service API, intended for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations, imported modules, and constant definitions. It does not process external input or user data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes unnecessary imports such as 'sys' for version checking, and some typographical inconsistencies (e.g., aliasing 'dict' to 'Dict' from builtins). No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are detected. The license comment states a future year ('2025') which is unusual but not malicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward set of type definitions using TypedDict and Union for static type annotations, aimed at modeling AWS QLDB API data structures. It uses conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions and includes standard Python typing practices. No runtime code, input handling, or network operations are present. No suspicious patterns, such as code injection, credential handling, or malicious behavior, are evident. The purpose is purely to support static analysis and code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a support library for type annotations in AWS SDK usage. The overall security risk is negligible.",
