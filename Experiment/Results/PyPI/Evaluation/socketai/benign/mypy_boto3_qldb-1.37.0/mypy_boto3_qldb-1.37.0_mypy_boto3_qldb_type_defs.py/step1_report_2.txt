  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS QLDB service requests and responses used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local literals module; class definitions reading input data from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code consists solely of type annotations and class definitions; no data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Type annotations specify data flow for function parameters and return types, not actual runtime data flow; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of TypedDict classes for type annotations, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No runtime logic, data processing, or external calls are present. The code follows standard patterns for type definitions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent. Import statements and data structures are straightforward, serving documentation and type checking purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign set of type definitions for AWS QLDB SDK bindings. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate type safety and documentation.",
