  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS QLDB service interactions, used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (sys, datetime, typing, typing_extensions), internal literals, and annotations for data structures.",
  "sinks": "No clear data sinks; no code execution, network communication, or data output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. The code strictly defines typed dictionaries for API requests/responses.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and conditional imports based on Python version to define typed dictionaries for AWS QLDB API interactions. It does not include any executable code, network calls, or dynamic code execution. All structures are type annotations and data schemas for documentation and type checking, with no signs of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely contains type definitions for AWS QLDB API requests and responses, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to be standard library code for type annotations.",
