  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS QLDB service interactions, primarily for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static code defining TypedDicts, constants, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data handling, external outputs, or data processing; purely static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution paths; serves as a schema for API request and response structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.version_info for compatibility, and a copyright year set to 2025, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for AWS QLDB SDK, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It contains no executable logic, no data leaks, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the copyright statement, likely a placeholder or typo. All indicators point to benign, auto-generated SDK type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations for AWS QLDB, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and very low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
