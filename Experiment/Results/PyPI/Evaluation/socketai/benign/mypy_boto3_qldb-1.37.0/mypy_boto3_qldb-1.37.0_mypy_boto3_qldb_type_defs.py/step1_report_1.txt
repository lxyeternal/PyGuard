{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS QLDB service interactions, providing type safety and clarity for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for string literals, import statements for type hints, and class definitions for request/response structures.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage could involve untrusted data being passed into these data structures, but no explicit sinks for malicious data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Data from external inputs (e.g., user or service input) flows into request dictionaries, which are then used in API calls; responses flow back into defined structures.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains no obfuscated constructs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. It mainly consists of straightforward type definitions and import logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports necessary modules and defines TypedDict classes for AWS QLDB API request and response types, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. No code executes logic or manipulates data at runtime; it purely declares data schemas. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of standard typing practices and clear structure suggests legitimate purpose. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or malware are detected. The structure is consistent with auto-generated SDK type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type annotations and data structures for AWS QLDB API interaction, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
