  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the QLDB service, including documentation and client setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing QLDBClient from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external network calls, no data leaks, no code execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only defines imports and exports without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set in 2025, which is in the future; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple interface for the QLDB service by importing QLDBClient and assigning it to Client, then exposing these via __all__. It includes a docstring with documentation link, usage example, and copyright info. There are no data inputs, no execution of untrusted code, or network activity. The only notable aspect is the future copyright year, which might be an oversight or typo, but does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for a service client. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
