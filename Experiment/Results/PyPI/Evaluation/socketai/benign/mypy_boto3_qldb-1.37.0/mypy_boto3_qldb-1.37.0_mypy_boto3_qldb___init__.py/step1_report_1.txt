  "purpose": "Main interface module for QLDB service, providing access to QLDBClient via boto3.",
  "sources": "The module imports QLDBClient from a local client module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The module assigns QLDBClient to Client for external use; no data flows from input to sensitive output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and follows standard conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as an interface wrapper, providing documentation, licensing info, and aliasing for QLDBClient. It imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable for external access, and declares exports. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code is simple and conventional, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, acting as an interface layer for the QLDB client. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
