  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports a class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- The documentation, usage examples, and licensing info are standard.\n- No untrusted input, external network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight but does not impact security.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), indicating the reviewers are certain about benignity.\n\n**Issue presence:**\n\n- No issues are present in the code; all reports correctly identify it as benign and straightforward.\n\n**Score analysis:**\n\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, justified given the code's simplicity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- Security risk: 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or concerns:**\n\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025). While this is not malicious, it could be flagged as an anomaly. However, the reports acknowledge this and do not consider it a security concern.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate; no overestimation or underestimation detected.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate, and their assessments align with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary. The code is a benign, standard interface module for the QLDB client, with no security concerns.",
