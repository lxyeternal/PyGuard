{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the QLDB service by exposing the QLDBClient class.",
  "sources": "Imports QLDBClient from a local module (.client).",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns and exposes a class.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward module that imports a class and exposes it via an alias. It contains documentation and usage examples but no dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted data handling. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or oversight. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and poses no security or malicious threat. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.0,
