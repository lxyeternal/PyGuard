  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the corresponding code carefully:\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code is a minimal wrapper module that imports `QLDBClient` from a local module and exposes it via a variable `Client`. It also provides documentation and usage examples.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted data.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future. This is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Main interface for QLDB, providing access via `Client`.\n- **Findings:** No sinks, flows, anomalies, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, securityRisk 0.0, confidence 1.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Similar, exposing `QLDBClient`.\n- **Findings:** No external input, no data leaks. Noted the future copyright year (2025).\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, securityRisk 0.0, confidence 1.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the future date is a minor inconsistency but not a security concern.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no network activity, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard module setup.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, securityRisk 0.0, confidence 1.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no data flow, no network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, securityRisk 0.0, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, securityRisk 0.0, confidence 1.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** No, all reports agree.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None detected.\n- **Potential issues:** Only the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n- The overall security risk is 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (benign, no security issues)\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which could be corrected for accuracy but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, with no security risks or malware.",
