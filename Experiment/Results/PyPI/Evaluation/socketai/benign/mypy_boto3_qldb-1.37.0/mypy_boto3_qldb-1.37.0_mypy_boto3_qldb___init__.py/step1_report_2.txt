{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for the QLDB service, exposing the QLDBClient class as a Client for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports QLDBClient from a local module, and reads no external input or user data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is sent or processed in a way that could leak or affect system security.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns a class to a variable and exports it.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future, potentially unusual, but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing a class, assigning it, and defining exports. It includes documentation and example usage, which is typical for a library module. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The only oddity is the future copyright year, which does not impact security but might be a minor inconsistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that exposes a client class for QLDB service without any malicious or suspicious components. There are no security concerns or malware indications.",
