{
  "purpose": "Provide the main interface for interacting with the Amazon QLDB service, exposing the QLDB client class for users.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module (.client import QLDBClient), and the usage example (though commented/documented).",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing, network communication, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class from a local module and assigns it to a variable, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code appears to be straightforward and well-structured. The copyright year is 2025, which is future-dated but not suspicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a simple interface for the QLDB service, importing a class from a local module and exposing it as 'Client'. The code includes a docstring with documentation links, a usage example, and an export list. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Overall, it appears to be a standard, benign interface setup with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface module for QLDB with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely exposes a client class for external use, with no suspicious or malicious features.",
