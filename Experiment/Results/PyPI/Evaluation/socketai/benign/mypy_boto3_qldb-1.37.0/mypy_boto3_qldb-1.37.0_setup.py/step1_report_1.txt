{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'mypy-boto3-qldb' Python library, defining package metadata, dependencies, and other distribution details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly interacts with untrusted input or outputs data in a security-sensitive manner.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code is a static setup configuration, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines package metadata for distribution. It reads a local README file for the long description, sets package details such as name, version, URL, author, and description. The dependencies are explicitly specified with conditional requirements. There are no dynamic code executions, no external input processing, and no network interactions or code injections. The code is a typical setup script consistent with standard packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs package setup tasks safely and as expected for a Python distribution script.",
