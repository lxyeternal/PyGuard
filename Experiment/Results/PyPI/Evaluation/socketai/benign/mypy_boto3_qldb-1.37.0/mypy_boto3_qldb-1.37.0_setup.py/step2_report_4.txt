  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** Confirms the script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious activity.  \n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description—static metadata, reading a local README.md, no dynamic or untrusted input.  \n- **Malware & obfuscated scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, confirms standard package setup with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis:** The code reads static files, sets package info, no dynamic code or external data processing.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no anomalies or malicious activity detected.  \n- **Analysis:** Static configuration, no dynamic or external input, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Both malware and obfuscated are 0.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Same assessment—benign setup script.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, static data, no external interactions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous findings—standard setup script.  \n- **Analysis:** Reads local README.md, static metadata, no dynamic or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Both malware and obfuscated are 0.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is exactly as described—a typical setup.py script with no dynamic or malicious code present.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious activity is detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward static code.  \n- **Risk score:** All are 0, justified by the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a standard Python package setup script, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reported scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
