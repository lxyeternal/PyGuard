{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script for 'mypy-boto3-qldb', defining package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata assigned directly in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution present; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static code with no obfuscation, secrets, or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a local file for description, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. It contains no user input, network activity, or code execution beyond static configuration. The code is typical for Python packaging and lacks any malicious or suspicious constructs. All signals point to benign, static setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals and scores align with this assessment. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
