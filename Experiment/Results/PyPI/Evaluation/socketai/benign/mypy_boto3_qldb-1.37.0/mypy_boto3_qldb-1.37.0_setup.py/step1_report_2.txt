{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures the Python package 'mypy-boto3-qldb' for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static data such as package name, version, author, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present in the script.",
  "flows": "N/A; the script primarily reads local static files and sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and reads a local markdown file for the long description. It then calls 'setup()' with static metadata about the package, including URLs, author info, classifiers, dependencies, and package data. All data appears static and intended for package configuration. No dynamic execution, user input, or untrusted data sources are involved. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
