  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library 'mypy-boto3-qldb' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports standard libraries and setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no network, file, or environment variable operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the script mainly defines package metadata and configuration without dynamic data flows or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a local file for description, and calls setup() with static metadata. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious payloads. All dependencies and URLs point to legitimate sources, and no user inputs or untrusted data are processed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
