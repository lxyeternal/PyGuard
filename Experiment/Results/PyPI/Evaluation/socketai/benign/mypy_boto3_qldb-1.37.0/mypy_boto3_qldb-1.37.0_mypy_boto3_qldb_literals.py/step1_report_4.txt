{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS QLDB service literals and other AWS service identifiers, used for type hinting and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sys' to determine Python version; definitions of string literal types.",
  "sinks": "No actual data processing, input/output, or external data handling present; only static type definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only defines type literals; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or sensitive data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines numerous string literal types for use in type annotations, mainly related to AWS services and resource identifiers. All definitions are static and straightforward, serving as type hints. There are no input processing, data handling, or external interactions. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs detected. The copyright notice and documentation link do not influence code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type annotations for AWS service literals, with no malicious intent, external data handling, or security risks. It serves purely for type safety and code clarity. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
