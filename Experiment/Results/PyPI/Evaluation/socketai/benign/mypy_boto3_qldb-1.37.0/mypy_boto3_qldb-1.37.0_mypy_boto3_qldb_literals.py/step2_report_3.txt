  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS service literals. No external data or input sources.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies that the code is static, purely declarative, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — reasonable.  \n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS identifiers, statuses, regions. No external data.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning correctly notes the static nature, compatibility considerations, and absence of malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, defining AWS service string literals.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning remains consistent; no dynamic code or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.  \n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for AWS QLDB and other identifiers.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies static, non-executable nature, no external data, no obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS identifiers and configurations.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same pattern; static, straightforward, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.  \n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type alias definitions for AWS service constants.  \n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are all reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nGiven the uniformity and correctness of all reports, I concur with their assessments. The code is benign, serving as static type annotations, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and transparent.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk inherent in static type definitions.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of type annotations for AWS SDKs, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
