  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service and resource identifiers used in boto3 stubs for type annotations.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; the code only declares literals and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code is purely type definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The code contains standard type alias declarations with conditional import for 'Literal' depending on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and only provides type aliases using Python's Literal for various predefined string values. It includes a conditional import for 'Literal' to support compatibility with Python versions prior to 3.12. The code does not perform any data processing, external input, network activity, or system modifications. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The structure is typical for type annotations and constants definitions, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition module for AWS service string literals, with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely facilitates type safety in a larger codebase. No security concerns or malware are present.",
