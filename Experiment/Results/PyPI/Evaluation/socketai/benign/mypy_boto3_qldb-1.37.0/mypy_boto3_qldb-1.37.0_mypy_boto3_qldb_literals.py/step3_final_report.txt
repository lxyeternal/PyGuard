  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS service literal definitions, providing type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements and type alias definitions, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; the code consists solely of static type alias declarations without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple string literal types for AWS services, statuses, and regions, using conditional import for compatibility. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The structure is purely declarative, serving as type hints for static analysis. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK constants, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. All reports accurately assess its safety, and no modifications are necessary.",
