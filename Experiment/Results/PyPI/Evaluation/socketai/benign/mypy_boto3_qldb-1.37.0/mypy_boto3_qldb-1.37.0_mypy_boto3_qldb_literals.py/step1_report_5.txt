{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service identifiers and configurations for use with type checking.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from static string literals, environment variables indirectly via type annotations, and external documentation references.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data leaks are present; the code primarily defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only declares static types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are observed. The code conditionally imports typing extensions based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases using Python's Literal for various AWS service names, resource types, regions, and status values. It uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility across Python versions. No input handling, no data processing, and no external code execution are present. All identifiers are static and well-documented, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a type annotation module for AWS SDK typings, providing no evidence of malicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward, benign utility module intended for type safety in Python projects. No security risks or malware are detected.",
