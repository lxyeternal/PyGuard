  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various AWS service literals for use in type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys' module and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. No data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None. The code only defines constants and types; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "None. The code consists solely of type alias definitions without runtime data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears to be straightforward type annotations with no suspicious code or hidden behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases using Python's Literal type to specify fixed string values representing AWS service constants. It includes conditional import for compatibility across Python versions. The entire file is static and purely declarative, serving as type hints for other modules. No input, output, or runtime logic present. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions intended for static type checking, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves a purely declarative purpose without any malicious behavior.",
