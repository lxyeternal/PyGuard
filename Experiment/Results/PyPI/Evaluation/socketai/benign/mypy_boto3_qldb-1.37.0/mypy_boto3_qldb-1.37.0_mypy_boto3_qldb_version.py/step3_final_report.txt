  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string with a copyright notice.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input/output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static assignment of a version string with a comment. No dynamic code, input, output, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The only notable aspect is the future copyright date, which is benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 with high confidence. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
