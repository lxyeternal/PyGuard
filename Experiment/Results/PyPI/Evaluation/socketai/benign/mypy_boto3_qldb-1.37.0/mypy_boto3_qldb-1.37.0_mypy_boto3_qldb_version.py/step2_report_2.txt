  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a copyright comment.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity is present.\n   - The code is minimal and typical for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns.\n   - The only notable point is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable since the analysis is straightforward.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code is purely static metadata, with no potential for malicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n   - No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - The future copyright year is noted but not considered suspicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My Final Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns.",
