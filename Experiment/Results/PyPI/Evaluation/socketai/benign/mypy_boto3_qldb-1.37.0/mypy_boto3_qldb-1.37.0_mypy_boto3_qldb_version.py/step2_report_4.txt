  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims, consistency, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- The code is minimal, containing only a comment, copyright notice, and version assignment.\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which is not malicious but somewhat atypical.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description: a simple string assignment to `__version__`.\n   - No evidence of dynamic code, input/output, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - The only point of note is the future copyright year, which is benign but somewhat unusual.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n   - The confidence score is 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify a risk higher than 0.5; all are consistent with a safe, static version declaration.\n   - The only potential concern is the future copyright date, but it does not constitute a security risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern but might be worth noting for completeness.\n- The code's purpose is purely metadata, and it does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score | Justification                                                  |\n|----------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0            | No malicious activity or indicators present.                     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.               |\n| Security Risk  | 0            | No vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.                       |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, standard, and poses no security concerns.**",
