  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A, straightforward assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with only version declaration and a comment; no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment and a variable assignment indicating the version. There are no input sources, no data processing, or any dynamic behavior. The version string appears static and benign. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious activity. The code serves a typical purpose in software versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple version declaration with no malicious behavior or security concerns. The code is standard for package versioning and does not contain any malicious intent.",
