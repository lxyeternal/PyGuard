{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the Amazon QLDB service, facilitating type-safe interaction with the service through boto3.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, typing, botocore modules, and local type definitions; class and method definitions accessing AWS QLDB features; property and method signatures with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "Methods that accept and unpack input parameters, return data structures, or generate URLs; no direct data leaks or system command executions observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into method calls via **kwargs, which are unpacked into specific request types; responses and property access occur after method invocation; no indication of untrusted data processing or malicious flow patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. Usage of type annotations and interface definitions is consistent with SDK wrapper code. No obfuscated or misleading code structures observed. The license and documentation comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a client class for AWS QLDB with associated exception handling and method signatures corresponding to AWS API operations. The import statements are standard, with conditional imports based on Python version, and the class methods align with the official boto3 QLDB client API. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. All methods are designed to interact with AWS services, and no hidden or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a type-safe interface for AWS QLDB, offering structured method signatures for various service operations. It appears to be a legitimate SDK wrapper or stub implementation without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
