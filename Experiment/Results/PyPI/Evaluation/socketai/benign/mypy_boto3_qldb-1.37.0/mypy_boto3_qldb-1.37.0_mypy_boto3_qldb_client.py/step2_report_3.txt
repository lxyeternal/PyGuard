  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security implications, logical consistency, and the accuracy of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that this code is a type stub/interface for boto3's QLDB client, with no executable logic or data processing. It notes the presence of generate_presigned_url, which is standard and not malicious.\n\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The confidence score is 1, which is appropriate given the clear nature of the code.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is justified; no malicious behavior detected. Risk score 0 is also appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that this is a static type interface with no runtime logic or data handling. The absence of suspicious patterns is correctly noted.\n\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The confidence score is 0.9, which seems reasonable given the clear and standard nature of the code.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity. Security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a detailed description of the code as a type annotation stub, with particular attention to generate_presigned_url. It correctly states that this is standard in AWS SDKs and not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The confidence score is 0.9, aligning with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0 is justified. Security risk is very low, though slightly above zero due to the URL generation feature, which is standard but can be misused if misconfigured—however, that is outside the scope of static code analysis here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the lack of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious code. It highlights that the code is a static interface with no runtime logic.\n\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The confidence score of 0.95 is appropriate.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score 0, security risk near zero, as expected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The report describes the code as a static, type-safe interface with no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. It notes the absence of dynamic code execution or data leaks.\n\n- **Findings:** No evidence of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. The confidence score of 0.95 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of type annotations and interface definitions for boto3's QLDB client, with no executable logic or data processing.\n\n- **Malware assessment:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent and justified. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or contain obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n- **Security risk:** The overall security risk is minimal to none, as the code is purely declarative and intended for static type checking.\n\n- **Generate_presigned_url:** This function can generate URLs with embedded credentials, but in this context, it's part of the standard SDK interface and not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n- **Potential assumptions:** No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities; all recognize the code as a benign interface.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly at **0**, given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk score:** Should stay at **0** or very close to it, as there's no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a benign, auto-generated, type stub interface for AWS SDK, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
