  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is purely type annotations and interface definitions with no executable logic.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None detected; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification for scores?** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, serving as static type stubs.\n- **Overall assessment:** No malicious activity, no security risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No, similar to Report 1, it's a static interface with no runtime logic.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0.9 — perhaps slightly high for risk; however, since it's just a stub, this is acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious behavior; the high risk score could be conservative but still acceptable given the nature.\n- **Overall assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1 — very low, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; the only minor concern is the generate_presigned_url method, which is standard.\n- **Overall assessment:** Safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1 — suitable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; the code is a type stub.\n- **Overall assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is a static interface with no malicious activity.\n- **Overall assessment:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code as static type annotations and interface definitions, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks in this code. It is a well-structured, auto-generated type stub for the AWS QLDB client, intended solely for static type checking and IDE support.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nApprove with confidence that this supply chain component is benign.",
