  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS QLDB service, providing method signatures and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and property definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations are mostly placeholders, calling AWS APIs via boto3. No untrusted data handling or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Method calls and property access, with no data processing or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of type annotations, class and method definitions, and documentation strings. It defines a client interface for AWS QLDB with methods matching the official boto3 client structure. There are no indications of malicious logic, code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a type stub or interface for a standard AWS SDK wrapper, serving as a type-safe binding with no runtime logic or data manipulation. Its purpose is to provide static type checking and documentation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type interface for AWS QLDB SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It mainly provides method signatures and documentation strings, serving as a type hinting stub. No signs of malware, data leakage, or sabotage are present.",
