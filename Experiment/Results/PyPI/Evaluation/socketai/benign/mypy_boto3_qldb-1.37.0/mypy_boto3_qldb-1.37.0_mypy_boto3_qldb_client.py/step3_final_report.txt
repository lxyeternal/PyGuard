  "purpose": "Type annotations for qldb service Client.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, class definitions, imported type defs, and documentation links; no runtime data or external input handling.",
  "sinks": "generate_presigned_url method can produce URLs with embedded credentials, but this is standard SDK behavior, not malicious.",
  "flows": "Method calls like generate_presigned_url, but no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs; all methods are interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; purely static interface with no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static type stub for the boto3 QLDB client, with no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. It includes standard AWS SDK features such as URL generation, which are common and not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores (~0). The presence of generate_presigned_url is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The code's purpose is solely for static type checking and IDE support, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated type stub for the AWS QLDB client, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The minor security consideration is the URL generation capability, which is standard in SDKs and not malicious in this context.",
