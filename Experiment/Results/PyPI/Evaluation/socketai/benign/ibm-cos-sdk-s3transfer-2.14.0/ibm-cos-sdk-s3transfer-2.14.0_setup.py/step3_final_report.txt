  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the ibm-cos-sdk-s3transfer library.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from __init__.py via regex; reading README.md for description.",
  "sinks": "None suspicious or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Version extraction from __init__.py; static data read for description; no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context managers in get_version() and setup() for long_description; no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script performing package configuration. It reads version info via regex, loads README for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, benign data. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. Minor hygiene issue with open() without 'with' context managers is noted but does not pose security risks. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor hygiene issue does not elevate the security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1.",
