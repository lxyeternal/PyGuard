  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Sources: Reading `__init__.py` for version, `README.md` for description.\n- Sinks: None suspicious.\n- Flows: Version extraction via regex; description from README.\n- Anomalies: No unusual patterns.\n- Analysis: Typical, benign setup code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, malware, or security risk.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Completely standard, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Packaging and distribution.\n- Sources: Version from `__init__.py`, description from README.\n- Sinks: None suspicious.\n- Flows: No untrusted data flow.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard setup script.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Also standard, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Package setup.\n- Sources: Version from `__init__.py`, description from README.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Static data read, no untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Typical setup code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Standard, benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Packaging.\n- Sources: Version from `__init__.py`, description from README.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Data flows are straightforward.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Standard, safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Packaging.\n- Sources: Version from `__init__.py`, description from README.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: Straightforward.\n- Anomalies: Uses `open()` without context manager, which is a minor security hygiene concern but not malicious.\n- Analysis: Standard setup code; no malicious behavior detected.\n- Conclusion: Safe, with a minor code hygiene note.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: Slightly elevated due to open() without context manager (0.2), but not a security breach.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is a typical setup script with no network activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. **Final malware score: 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports mention obfuscation, and the code is straightforward. **Final obfuscated score: 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports agree that the code is benign. The only minor concern is the use of `open()` without a context manager in report 5, which is a code hygiene issue but not a security risk. Given that, a conservative final risk score would be low, around 0.1 to 0.2.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The scores given in the reports are consistent with the analysis.\n- The minor hygiene issue (using `open()` without `with`) does not justify increasing the risk score significantly.\n- No evidence suggests any security vulnerability or malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| Malware            | 0            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1 - 0.2    |\n\n**Overall, this package setup script appears safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code.**",
