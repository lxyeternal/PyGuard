  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for copying objects in an S3-compatible environment. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The minimal security risk score reflects standard concerns about untrusted input handling, which are properly mitigated. The overall assessment indicates a safe and standard utility module."
