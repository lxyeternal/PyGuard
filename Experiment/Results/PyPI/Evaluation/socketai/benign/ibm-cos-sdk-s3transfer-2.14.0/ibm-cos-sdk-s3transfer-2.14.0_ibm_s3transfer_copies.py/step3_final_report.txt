{
  "purpose": "The code manages copying objects in an S3-like environment, supporting both single and multipart copies, with argument filtering, size adjustments, progress callbacks, and task coordination.",
  "sources": "External inputs such as 'call_args', 'transfer_future.meta', and 'extra_args' passed into SDK calls like head_object, copy_object, upload_part_copy, and complete_multipart_upload.",
  "sinks": "API calls to head_object, copy_object, upload_part_copy, and complete_multipart_upload which interact with the cloud storage service.",
  "flows": "External inputs (sources) are filtered via get_filtered_dict and used in SDK calls (sinks); data flows from inputs through filtering into API calls for copying objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected. Argument filtering is properly implemented, and all SDK calls are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard S3 object copying, including multipart upload support, with proper argument filtering and size management. It relies on external inputs but filters them to prevent injection or misuse. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, using SDK methods correctly, and no anomalies or security flaws are evident. The risk primarily involves untrusted input handling, which is mitigated by filtering functions. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for copying objects in an S3-compatible environment. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The minimal security risk score reflects standard concerns about untrusted input handling, which are properly mitigated. The overall assessment indicates a safe and standard utility module.",
