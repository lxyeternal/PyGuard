  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to AWS S3 transfer operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points; solely exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists of class declarations without execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes, inheriting from base Python exception types and a specific AWS exception. There is no dynamic code, no input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, providing structured error handling. No hardcoded secrets, malicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions used for error handling in AWS transfer operations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
