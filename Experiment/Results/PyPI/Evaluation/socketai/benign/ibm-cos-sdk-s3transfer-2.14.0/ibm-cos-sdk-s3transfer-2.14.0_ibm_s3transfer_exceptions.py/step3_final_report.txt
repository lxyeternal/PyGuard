  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in AWS transfer utilities.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are instantiated as needed but contain no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions and AWS-specific exceptions. There are no dynamic operations, data processing, or embedded logic. The import from 'concurrent.futures' is standard and used for defining a subclass of 'CancelledError'. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code serves as part of an error handling framework, with no network activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions used for error handling in AWS SDK or transfer utilities. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
