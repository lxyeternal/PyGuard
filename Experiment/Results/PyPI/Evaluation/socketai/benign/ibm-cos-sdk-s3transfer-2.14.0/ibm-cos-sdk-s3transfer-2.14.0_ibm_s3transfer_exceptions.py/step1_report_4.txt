{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to AWS S3 transfers and retries.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exceptions are raised internally within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, including a subclass of CancelledError with a custom message. It imports only a single module, 'concurrent.futures', for exception handling. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as part of an error handling mechanism for AWS SDK transfer processes. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in AWS transfer processes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks, serving purely as standard error classes.",
