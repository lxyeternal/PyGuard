  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to AWS S3 uploads and transfer operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; the code only defines classes and imports a module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are used for exception handling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears standard for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard concurrent futures exception, defines multiple custom exception classes, and extends one class with additional context. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated elements, or suspicious patterns. The classes are straightforward and serve typical error handling purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard custom exception class definitions for error handling in AWS-related transfer operations. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears legitimate and benign.",
