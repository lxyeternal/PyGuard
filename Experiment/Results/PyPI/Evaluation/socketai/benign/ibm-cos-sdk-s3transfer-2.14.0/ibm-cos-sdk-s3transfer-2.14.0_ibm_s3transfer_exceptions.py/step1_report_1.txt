{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to retries, S3 uploads, subscriber methods, transfer completion, and transfer cancellation.",
  "sources": "No user input or untrusted data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output actions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no embedded logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library module, defines several custom exception classes, and a subclass of CancelledError. All components appear standard and appropriate for error handling in a Python application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No external data is read, processed, or written. The code is clean, well-structured, and contains no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining custom exception classes for error handling. There is no malicious behavior, security risk, or obfuscation detected. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase, serving as error definitions.",
