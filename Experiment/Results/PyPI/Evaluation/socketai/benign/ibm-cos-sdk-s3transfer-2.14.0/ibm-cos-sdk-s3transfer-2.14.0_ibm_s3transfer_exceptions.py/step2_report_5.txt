  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is solely defining custom exception classes.\n- No sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted input are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded logic are detected.\n- The code is standard, clean, and appears to be a benign part of a larger AWS SDK or utility library.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The code imports only a standard library module (`concurrent.futures`) and defines exception classes, including a subclass of `CancelledError`.\n- The `RetriesExceededError` class captures the last exception, which is a common pattern and not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present.\n- The consistent \"malware\" score of 0 across all reports aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; the code is purely for error handling and poses no security risk.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- No adjustments needed; the reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores reflect the true nature of the code.\n- No further action is necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
