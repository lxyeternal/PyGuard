  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, input/output, or external data handling.\n- All exception classes are standard and straightforward.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n- The import is from a standard library, and inheritance is appropriate.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Security risk scores:**\n\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Purpose and reasoning:**\n\n- The purpose of each report is accurate: these are simple exception class definitions used for error handling.\n- The analysis in each report correctly states that no malicious activity or security issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Specific notes:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is as described—only exception class definitions. No issues are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the code is standard and correct.\n- **Score reasonableness:** The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state the benign nature.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, and considering the code's benign nature, I would **agree with the provided scores**:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**My own estimates** would match these.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Code verification:** No issues or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** All appropriate; no changes needed.\n- **Overall conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No further action required; the code is safe and correctly scored.",
