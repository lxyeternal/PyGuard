  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The slight risk score reflects reliance on external parameters, which is standard for such operations. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern and functions as intended."
