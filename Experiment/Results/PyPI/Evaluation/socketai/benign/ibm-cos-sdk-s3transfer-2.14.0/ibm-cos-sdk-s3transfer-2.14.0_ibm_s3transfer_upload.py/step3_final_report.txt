{
  "purpose": "The code manages file uploads to cloud storage, supporting various input types, multipart uploads, progress callbacks, and interruption handling, utilizing SDK calls such as put_object and upload_part.",
  "sources": "File-like objects, filenames (strings), in-memory bytes buffers, and call_args.fileobj from transfer futures.",
  "sinks": "SDK methods (put_object, upload_part) that send data over the network; progress callbacks that may leak data if misused.",
  "flows": "Sources (file objects, filenames, buffers) are wrapped with interruption and bandwidth limiters, then passed to SDK calls via transfer futures, with progress callbacks triggered during read operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or network anomalies detected. The code follows standard patterns for upload management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation for uploading files to cloud storage, supporting multiple input types, multipart uploads, progress tracking, and interruption. It uses SDK calls appropriately, manages resources correctly, and includes mechanisms for progress aggregation and error propagation. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or network activity beyond legitimate upload requests. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to resource exhaustion if misused, but this is typical for such utilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, consistent with the detailed assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-designed upload utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the scoring in the reports accurately reflects its benign nature. No modifications are necessary.",
