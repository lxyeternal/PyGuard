  "purpose": "A high-level transfer manager for Amazon S3, managing uploads, downloads, copies, and deletions with concurrency, bandwidth limiting, and event handling.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as file objects, bucket names, keys, and extra arguments; external S3 API calls.",
  "sinks": "External S3 API endpoints; no untrusted data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided file objects or filenames into transfer tasks scheduled on executors, with coordination and event signaling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of an S3 transfer manager. It performs argument validation, manages concurrency via executors, handles bandwidth limiting, and registers event handlers. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are present. The code uses common patterns and external libraries appropriately, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure transfer management module with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The overall risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting typical operational risks without malicious implications.",
