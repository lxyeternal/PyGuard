  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate, and secure transfer management library with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the absence of external data handling or network activity."
