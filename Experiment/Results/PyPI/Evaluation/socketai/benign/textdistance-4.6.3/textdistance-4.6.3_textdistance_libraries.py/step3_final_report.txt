  "purpose": "A plugin management system for string similarity algorithms, dynamically importing modules based on stored module and function names, with controlled data sources.",
  "sources": "Module names and function names retrieved from internal code structures and external JSON configuration ('libraries.json').",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via import_module, attribute access for functions and classes, and potential execution of imported code.",
  "flows": "Reading module and function names from 'libraries.json' or class attributes -> import_module() -> getattr() -> function or class instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The dynamic import is controlled and based on predefined data.",
  "analysis": "The code manages plugin libraries for string similarity measures, loading modules dynamically based on predefined names. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import process is controlled and relies on internal data structures, minimizing risk. External JSON data could be manipulated if compromised, but in the current context, it appears safe. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are detected. The overall security risk is low, primarily contingent on the trustworthiness of external data sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured plugin architecture with controlled dynamic imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The primary concern is external data integrity, which is outside the scope of this code segment. Overall, the security posture is acceptable with minimal risk.",
