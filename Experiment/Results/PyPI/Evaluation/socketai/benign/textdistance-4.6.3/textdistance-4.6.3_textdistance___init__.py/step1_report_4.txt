  "purpose": "To provide a Python package for computing distances between sequences using various algorithms with a common interface.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__title__, __version__, __author__, __license__), and the import statements from algorithms and utils modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially imported modules (.algorithms, .utils) could contain untrusted code, but no direct sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted data sources are visible in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) from internal modules can obscure the actual imported code, but this is common in package __init__.py files. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains package metadata and two import statements for internal modules. No input handling, data processing, network activity, or other operations are present. The wildcard imports may obscure the specific imported content but are standard in package __init__.py files. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initializer file with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes the package's internal modules. No malware, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are detected.",
