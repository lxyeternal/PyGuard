  "purpose": "To provide a Python package for computing distances between sequences using multiple algorithms.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .algorithms and .utils modules; package metadata variables (__title__, __version__, __author__, __license__, VERSION).",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations shown.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly demonstrated in the provided code snippet; mainly module metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures; import wildcard statements are standard for library packages but can complicate dependency analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of package metadata definitions and import statements. It imports all functions/classes from submodules (.algorithms and .utils), which could contain relevant code. However, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors in this snippet. The use of wildcard imports is typical in library code but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no network operations, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package entry point with no indications of malicious activity or security risks based on the provided snippet. The primary concern would be inspecting the imported modules for any malicious behavior, but this cannot be inferred here.",
