  "purpose": "Provide a Python package for computing distances between sequences using multiple algorithms with a common interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .algorithms and .utils modules",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks; no network connections, file writes, or environment variable usage observed",
  "flows": "Imports from package modules serve as sources; potential usage of imported functions or classes in other parts of the package could process data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code defines basic package metadata and imports all functions/classes from internal modules 'algorithms' and 'utils'. No external data input, network activity, or unsafe operations are present. The code appears to be a standard package setup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign package initialization script setting up module metadata and importing core functionalities. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
