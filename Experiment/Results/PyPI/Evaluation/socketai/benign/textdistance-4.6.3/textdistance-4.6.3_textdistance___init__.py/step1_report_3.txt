  "purpose": "Provides an interface for calculating distance between sequences using multiple algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (__title__, __version__, __author__, __license__) and imports modules from algorithms and utils submodules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Imports modules after setting package info; no data flows from external sources or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines package metadata and imports submodules. No external input processing, no network activity, and no execution of dynamic code. The imports are standard for a package structure. The comments clarify intent but do not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward package initialization file with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script that declares metadata and imports modules for sequence distance algorithms. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
