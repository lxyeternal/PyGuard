{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python package for computing distances between sequences using multiple algorithms.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.algorithms' and '.utils' modules; defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; no untrusted data handling or output involved.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only sets up package info and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Imports all contents from internal modules without explicit control; no apparent hardcoded credentials or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets package metadata (__title__, __version__, etc.) and imports submodules for algorithms and utilities. It does not include executable logic, user input handling, network activity, or sensitive operations. The use of 'from .algorithms import *' and 'from .utils import *' is common in package __init__.py files to expose module functionalities. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization file that exports core modules for sequence distance computations. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are evident. The package structure seems typical for a Python library, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
