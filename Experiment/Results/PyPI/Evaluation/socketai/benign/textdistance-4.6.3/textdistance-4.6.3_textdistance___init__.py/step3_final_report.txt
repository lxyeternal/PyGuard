  "purpose": "Package metadata and module exports for the TextDistance library.",
  "sources": "Package metadata variables (__title__, __version__, etc.) and wildcard imports from .algorithms and .utils modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external data sinks in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are static; imports expose submodule contents, but no data flow or execution logic is visible.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports in __init__.py, which can obscure imported symbols but is common in package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file defining metadata and exposing submodules via wildcard imports. No executable code, network activity, or data processing is present. The wildcard imports are typical for package __init__.py files, intended to make submodule contents accessible at package level. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The supply chain risk is negligible based on this snippet.",
