  "purpose": "This code imports all functions and classes from multiple modules related to different processing methods, likely for a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from local modules: compression_based, edit_based, phonetic, sequence_based, simple, token_based.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing points present in this snippet; the code only imports modules.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown; potential data flows depend on how imported modules are used elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) can obscure what is actually imported, which may hide malicious or unintended code if the modules contain such. No explicit malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected here.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import statements from local modules with wildcard imports. This practice reduces code clarity but is not inherently malicious. The code itself does not include input/output, network operations, or data handling. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are visible within this snippet. Since the code only imports modules and does not execute any code or contain hidden logic, it appears benign. However, the actual security assessment depends on the contents of the imported modules, which are not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import structure with no explicit malicious behavior or security risks detected in this fragment. The use of wildcard imports is not recommended for clarity but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, this snippet appears safe, pending review of the imported modules.",
