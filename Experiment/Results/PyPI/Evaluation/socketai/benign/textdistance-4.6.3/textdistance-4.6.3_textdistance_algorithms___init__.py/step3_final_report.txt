  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules into the namespace; no data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code within modules.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules using wildcard syntax. No external data, network activity, or code execution is visible. Wildcard imports are discouraged as they reduce code clarity and can mask malicious or unintended code within imported modules. All reports correctly identify the use of wildcard imports as a concern but find no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the import pattern concern. Confidence in benign assessment is high, but the actual security depends on the trustworthiness of the imported modules, which are not provided. The code itself appears benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package import setup using wildcard imports, which pose a minor security and maintainability concern but do not indicate malicious behavior. The risk is primarily due to obscured symbols, not active malicious code. Scores are consistent with this assessment; no changes are necessary.",
