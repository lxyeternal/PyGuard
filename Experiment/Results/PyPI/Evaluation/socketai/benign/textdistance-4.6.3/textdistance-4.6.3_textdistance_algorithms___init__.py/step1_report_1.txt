  "purpose": "Import various modules related to different processing techniques (compression, edit distance, phonetics, sequence, simple, token-based) in a package structure.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the same package directory",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only internal module imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can obscure what is actually imported and may hide malicious or unintended code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports from multiple modules within the package. Wildcard imports can hide imported symbols, potentially importing malicious or unwanted code without clear visibility. No data handling, network activity, or external data processing is present. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious patterns, but the use of wildcard imports is a potential concern for code clarity and security transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs package module imports with no direct malicious behavior detected. However, the use of wildcard imports warrants caution as it can mask malicious code within the imported modules. No external or malicious activities are evident in this snippet.",
