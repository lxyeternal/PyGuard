{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating permutations, combinations, and n-grams from text input, likely for natural language processing or analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: *texts in words_combinations and input_list in find_ngrams.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data in a way that leads to data leaks, code execution, or system effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (texts or input_list) through processing functions without external data sources or outputs that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected. The use of standard library functions and straightforward logic reduces suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: words_combinations and find_ngrams. words_combinations generates permutations and combinations of input text data, while find_ngrams creates n-grams from a sequence. Both functions operate solely on the provided data structures without external interactions, network calls, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated constructs, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to serve legitimate NLP preprocessing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for text processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manipulates input data in standard ways. No malicious intent or security threats are evident.",
