{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating permutations, combinations of words, and n-grams from input text data.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters: *texts in words_combinations and input_list in find_ngrams.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output to external systems; no untrusted data handling beyond function input processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into text processing functions, but there are no external data transmissions or risky data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of text permutation, combination, and n-gram generation. It uses standard library functions (permutations, product, zip) without any external or unsafe operations. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or privacy violations. Functions operate solely on provided input data, with no external data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, intended for text analysis or processing tasks. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
