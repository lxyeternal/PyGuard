  "purpose": "Utility functions for text processing: generating word combinations, permutations, and n-grams.",
  "sources": "Input texts for words_combinations; input_list for find_ngrams.",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate purely on input data without external data flows.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions, processed internally, no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard text manipulation tasks using itertools and typing. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or external interactions are present. The functions are simple, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The permutation and product operations could be computationally expensive but are not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe code constructs are detected. The code's logic is transparent and aligns with benign utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for text processing with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent.",
