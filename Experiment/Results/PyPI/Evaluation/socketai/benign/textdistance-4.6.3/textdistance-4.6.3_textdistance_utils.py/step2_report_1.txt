  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code logic, and scoring consistency.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, performing standard text processing functions.\n- No reports identify any suspicious or malicious code constructs.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the benign assessments.\n- Confidence levels are high, mostly 0.9 or 1.0, reflecting certainty in benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Consistency:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are straightforward implementations of permutations, combinations, and n-grams, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Potential issues:** The only notable aspect is that `words_combinations` involves permutations and product, which could be computationally expensive for large inputs but not malicious.\n- **Malware suspicion:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The functions are utility in nature.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified, as the code does not pose security risks.\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- The reports do not mention any assumptions about the functions potentially being used maliciously. Given the code's simplicity, this is appropriate.\n- No report suggests that the code could be exploited or contains vulnerabilities that could lead to security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nI concur with the reports. The code is benign, straightforward, and has no malicious features. The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious behavior detected                               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is clear, no obfuscation                                |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No vulnerabilities or security concerns identified          |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign utility for text processing, with no security or malicious concerns.",
