{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for generating word combinations and n-grams from input texts.",
  "sources": "Reads input texts, specifically the *texts arguments in words_combinations and the input_list in find_ngrams.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; functions process data in-memory without external communication or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Input texts are split and permuted, then combined to evaluate a function; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of permutations and product could lead to high computational complexity, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements combinatorial functions: one for generating and evaluating permutations and combinations of input texts, and another for creating n-grams. No network operations, no file I/O, no eval or exec, and no use of sensitive environment variables. The logic appears straightforward and intended for linguistic or data processing purposes. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions operate on input data without side effects that could harm or leak data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs data processing tasks related to text analysis without external communications or security risks.",
