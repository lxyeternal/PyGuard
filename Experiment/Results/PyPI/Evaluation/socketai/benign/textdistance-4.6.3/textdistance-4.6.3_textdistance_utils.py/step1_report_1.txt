{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating word permutations, combinations, and n-grams, likely for text processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'texts' in 'words_combinations' and 'input_list' in 'find_ngrams', which are data sources for text processing.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform computations and return numerical or list outputs; no direct sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through splitting, permutation, combination, and n-gram generation functions, with results returned for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code relies on standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard text processing functions: 'words_combinations' generates permutations and combinations based on a provided function 'f'; 'find_ngrams' extracts n-grams from a sequence. The functions do not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a typical utility for text analysis, with no indicators of supply chain attack vectors or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for text processing tasks. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code appears to serve legitimate purposes without any suspicious features.",
