{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for generating word combinations and n-grams from input texts, likely for linguistic or analytical purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through function arguments: *texts (for words_combinations) and input_list (for find_ngrams).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that process or send data to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "The functions process input data locally: words_combinations generates permutations and combinations, find_ngrams generates n-grams, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The code strictly performs data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules (itertools, typing) without any external or unsafe functions. The functions generate permutations, product combinations, and n-grams in a straightforward manner. No dynamic execution, no network calls, no data exfiltration, and no use of environment variables. No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior are detected. The code appears to be a standard linguistic utility without hidden or malicious functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, providing linguistic data processing functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
