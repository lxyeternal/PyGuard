{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'textdistance' Python package, configuring dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing 'setuptools' for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system modification occurs beyond reading files and setting package info.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' → setting package parameters → executing setup() with package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The code is standard for a setup script. The multiple alias keys in 'extras' (e.g., 'extra', 'benchmarks') could cause confusion but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration, reads a README file with fallbacks, defines dependencies in various categories, and invokes 'setup()' with package metadata. The dependencies are typical for testing, linting, benchmarking, and core functionality. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected. No code injection, data leakage, or security risk behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script for the 'textdistance' package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages package dependencies and metadata, with safe file reading operations and no suspicious logic.",
