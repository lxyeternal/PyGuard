  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'textdistance' Python package, defining dependencies, package info, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description, package data definitions, and package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external data outputs found; no network communication or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' into 'long_description' during setup; no complex data flows or user input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of standard 'setuptools' setup routine.",
  "analysis": "Code primarily performs package setup tasks, including dependency specification and metadata. The code reads a README file with exception handling but no user input or external data processing. No code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard practices and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
