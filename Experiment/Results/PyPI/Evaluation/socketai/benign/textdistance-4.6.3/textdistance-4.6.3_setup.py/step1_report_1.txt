  "purpose": "Define dependencies and setup configuration for the 'textdistance' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description, defining dependencies in 'extras' and 'setup()' arguments.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is used in a manner that could lead to data leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "File reading (README.md) to 'long_description' variable, then used in setup(). No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to be a standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up package dependencies, reads a README file, and configures package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious logic present. The dependencies are standard for a package build process. The reading of README.md is straightforward and enclosed in try-except blocks to handle errors. No anomalies or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It handles dependencies and metadata configuration securely and transparently.",
