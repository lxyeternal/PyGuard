  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'textdistance', specifying dependencies, package info, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file to get long description, and static strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No untrusted data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Reads external file 'README.md' to set long description; static package data and metadata are assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package configuration, defines dependencies across multiple categories, handles reading the README file with fallback options, and sets up package metadata. No code executes untrusted input, no network connections, or system modifications. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is typical for Python package setup, with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only manages package metadata and dependencies. The code appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
