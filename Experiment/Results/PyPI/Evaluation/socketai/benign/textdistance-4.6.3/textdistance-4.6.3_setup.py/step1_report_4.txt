  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'textdistance' Python package, defining dependencies, metadata, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; importing setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no execution of untrusted input or code.",
  "flows": "Reading file input for long description; passing static data to setup function; no dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard packaging library 'setuptools' and reads the README.md for long description. It defines dependencies in a structured manner under 'extras' for various purposes. It handles file reading with error fallback, which is a common practice. The setup() call uses static, predefined metadata and dependencies. No external data, user input, or untrusted sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious code constructs identified; all code appears to be standard setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and uses static data. The structure is typical and safe for open-source package distribution.",
