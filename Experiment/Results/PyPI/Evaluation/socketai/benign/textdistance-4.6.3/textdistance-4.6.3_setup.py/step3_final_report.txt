  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, defining dependency lists, static metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading static files and setting package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple alias keys ('extra', 'benchmarks') in 'extras' could cause confusion but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. It reads a README file safely with exception handling, defines dependencies in various categories, and calls 'setup()' with fixed metadata. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minor potential confusion over alias keys does not constitute a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero. The slight concern about alias keys does not impact security. The scores assigned in the original reports are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to set the securityRisk score to 0 for consistency.",
