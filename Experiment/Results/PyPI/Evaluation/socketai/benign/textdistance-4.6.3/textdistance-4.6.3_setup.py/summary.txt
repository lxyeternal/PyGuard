  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero. The slight concern about alias keys does not impact security. The scores assigned in the original reports are appropriate, with a minor adjustment to set the securityRisk score to 0 for consistency."
