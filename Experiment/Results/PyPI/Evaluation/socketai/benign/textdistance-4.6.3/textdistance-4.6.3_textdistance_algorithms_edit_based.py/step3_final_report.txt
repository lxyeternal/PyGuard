{
  "purpose": "Implementation of various sequence similarity and distance algorithms such as Hamming, Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, Needleman-Wunsch, Smith-Waterman, Gotoh, StrCmp95, and MLIPNS, primarily for string and sequence comparison tasks.",
  "sources": "Input sequences provided via class methods or function calls; no external data sources or environment variables involved.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file I/O; all computations are internal.",
  "flows": "Data flows within the class methods and functions, processing sequences to compute similarity or distance metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. External 'numpy' is imported conditionally for performance optimization, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard, well-documented algorithms for sequence comparison, with clear structure and no signs of malicious behavior. Optional numpy usage is handled gracefully and solely for computational efficiency. No external data leaks, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. Commented-out code is benign and typical in development.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of sequence similarity algorithms with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by the optional numpy dependency and the benign purpose.",
