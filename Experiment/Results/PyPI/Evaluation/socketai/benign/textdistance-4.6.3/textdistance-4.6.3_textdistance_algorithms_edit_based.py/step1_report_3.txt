{
  "purpose": "This code provides implementations of various string and sequence similarity/distance algorithms, including Hamming, Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, Needleman-Wunsch, Smith-Waterman, Gotoh, StrCmp95, and MLIPNS.",
  "sources": "The code reads input sequences through function parameters and internal sequence processing methods. It imports standard libraries, optional numpy, and local modules (.base and .types).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands. No apparent untrusted data outputs or sensitive data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into similarity/distance calculations, with no external network or data exfiltration mechanisms. Computed scores are returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are identified. Usage of numpy is optional, handled gracefully. The code appears straightforward and standard for similarity calculations. No obfuscated code or misleading dynamic execution detected. The code imports local modules, but these are not suspicious by themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard sequence similarity algorithms with well-documented mathematical foundations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, system manipulation, or data exfiltration. Optional dependencies are handled safely. All functions operate within expected parameters, and no suspicious patterns or code constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate library for string and sequence similarity calculations, with no malicious intent or security risks observed. It is well-structured, and no indicators of sabotage or malware are present.",
