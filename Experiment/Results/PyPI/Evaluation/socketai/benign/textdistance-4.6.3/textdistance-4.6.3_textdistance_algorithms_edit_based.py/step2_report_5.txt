  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code implements standard sequence similarity/distance algorithms (Hamming, Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler, Needleman-Wunsch, Smith-Waterman, Gotoh, StrCmp95, MLIPNS).\n\n- No external data sinks, network operations, or system modifications are detected.\n\n- The only external dependency is `numpy`, imported conditionally, used solely for matrix operations, which is typical and benign.\n\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or hidden behaviors are identified.\n\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured library for sequence comparison.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0 across the board, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), consistent with the absence of external communication or malicious features.\n\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0 or close), reflecting the clear, standard implementations.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The only minor concern is the optional `numpy` import, but it is handled gracefully and used only for performance, not malicious purposes.\n\n- Commented-out code (e.g., in `NeedlemanWunsch`) is typical and not suspicious.\n\n- No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no external data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, not obfuscated.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, due to optional dependencies and no external data transfer.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- The code is a standard, transparent implementation of sequence similarity algorithms.\n\n- No hidden malicious features or obfuscation detected.\n\n- The only potential concern is the optional `numpy` dependency, which is benign.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Risk             | 0.1             |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscating features.",
