  "purpose": "Define base classes for sequence similarity/distance calculations with extensibility for external libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports, class methods, and static methods that process sequences, counters, and external library interactions.",
  "sinks": "Potential points include 'external_answer' calling external libraries, and 'lib.get_function()' execution.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through sequence normalization, counters, and passed to external functions in 'external_answer', which can lead to untrusted code execution if external libraries are malicious or compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'libraries.get_libs' and dynamic external function execution in 'external_answer' could be suspicious if external libraries are malicious. The code dynamically calls functions returned from external sources without explicit validation, which could be a potential risk if the libraries are malicious or compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for sequence comparison, with methods for similarity, distance, and external library integration. It relies on external libraries via 'libraries.get_libs', dynamically fetching functions to perform calculations. The external answer method could invoke untrusted code if the external libraries are malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code’s design to allow external plugins poses a risk if those plugins are malicious, but the code itself does not contain malicious payloads. The 'lib.get_function()' call and subsequent execution is the only notable point that could be exploited if external libraries are compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for sequence similarity/distance with extensibility for external libraries. The only potential security concern is the dynamic execution of external functions via 'lib.get_function()', which could be exploited if malicious external libraries are used. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected within this code fragment itself.",
