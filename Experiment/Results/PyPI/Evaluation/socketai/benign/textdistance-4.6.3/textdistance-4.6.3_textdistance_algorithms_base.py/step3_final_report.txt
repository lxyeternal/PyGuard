{
  "purpose": "Defines base classes for sequence similarity and distance calculations with support for external plugin libraries, enabling extensibility of algorithms.",
  "sources": "External library functions accessed via 'lib.get_function()' within 'external_answer()' and 'libraries.get_libs()' to retrieve plugin libraries.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of external functions via 'func(*prepared_sequences)', which could execute malicious code if external libraries are compromised.",
  "flows": "Code retrieves external libraries, checks conditions, prepares sequences, and calls external functions, all within 'external_answer()' with exception suppression.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'suppress(Exception)' around external function calls can hide errors or malicious failures; reliance on dynamic external code without sandboxing or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured framework for sequence similarity/distance with extension points via external libraries. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the dynamic invocation of external functions, which could be malicious if external plugins are compromised. The use of 'suppress(Exception)' can hide errors, including malicious failures, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; security risk scores of around 0.2-0.4 reflect moderate concern due to external code execution potential. Overall, the code itself is benign; the primary risk stems from trusting external libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured sequence similarity framework with external plugin support. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of external libraries, which could execute malicious code if compromised. The scores assigned are consistent with this assessment.",
