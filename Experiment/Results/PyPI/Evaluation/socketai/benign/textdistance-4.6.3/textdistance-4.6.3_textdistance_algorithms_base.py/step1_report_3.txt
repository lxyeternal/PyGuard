  "purpose": "Define base classes for sequence similarity and distance calculations with optional external library integration.",
  "sources": "Import statements; class methods accessing external libraries; suppress context manager; use of __future__ import for annotations.",
  "sinks": "Potential external library function calls; suppression of exceptions; use of dynamic attributes.",
  "flows": "Method calls to external libraries via libraries.get_libs, lib.check_conditions, lib.get_function, and lib.prepare; suppress(Exception) around external calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suppress(Exception) to silently ignore errors in external library calls; dynamic attribute access in external_answer; no hardcoded secrets or credential leaks; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines class structures for similarity measures with optional external library support. It interacts with external libraries through a controlled interface, checking conditions before calling external functions and suppressing exceptions silently, which could hide errors or malicious behavior if external libraries are malicious. There are no indicators of embedded backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The external calls are abstracted and involve only the external library interface, not directly executing untrusted code. The suppression of exceptions may conceal issues but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity is detected. The code structure appears standard and intended for modular similarity computations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of sequence similarity classes with optional external library integration. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage, but the use of suppress(Exception) could hide issues if external libraries are compromised. Overall, it appears safe and non-malicious, with a low malware risk.",
