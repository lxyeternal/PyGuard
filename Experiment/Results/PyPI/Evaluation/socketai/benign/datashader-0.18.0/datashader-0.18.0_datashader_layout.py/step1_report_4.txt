  "purpose": "The code provides layout algorithms for assigning 2D coordinates to graph nodes, including random, circular, and force-directed layouts.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from 'nodes' and 'edges' dataframes, extracting node IDs, coordinates, and edge connections. It also uses optional seed and parameter inputs.",
  "sinks": "Coordinates are assigned to nodes; no untrusted data outputs are evident. No external network or file operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Input dataframes are read for node and edge data; positions are computed and added as new columns to the nodes dataframe; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses Numba's JIT compilation, but only for a performance-critical internal function (_cooling), not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected. No obfuscated code features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple graph layout algorithms, primarily for visualization purposes. It reads node and edge dataframes, computes new coordinate columns, and returns the updated dataframes. The use of numpy, scipy.sparse, and param is standard. The _cooling function uses Numba for performance but is a typical physics-based simulation for layout stabilization. No network activity, file I/O, or suspicious behavior observed. All operations appear consistent with intended graph layout functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard graph layout computations with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code behavior. It is well-structured, using common libraries and techniques for performance optimization. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
