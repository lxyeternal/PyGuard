  "purpose": "Module setup and dependency management for a Python package, including optional features and version-dependent imports.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, version checks, optional module imports, fallback functions for missing modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; fallback functions return strings or raise errors, which are safe.",
  "flows": "Import statements and fallback functions are straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; fallback functions are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard import management, version checks, and optional dependency handling with safe fallback functions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The fallback functions simply inform about missing modules or raise errors, which is safe. The optional external modules (pyct) could, in theory, execute malicious code if compromised, but this risk is external and not inherent in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The existing malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
