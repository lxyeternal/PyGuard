  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward, performing imports, version checks, and setting up optional commands with fallback functions. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, standard package setup.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe import practices, version checks, and fallback functions. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; consistent with code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard import and dependency management, no signs of malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Benign setup code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** The code handles optional dependencies safely, with fallback functions that provide messages or raise errors. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Routine, safe code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, with standard conditional imports and fallback functions. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Analysis:** All reports describe code that performs module imports, version checks, and optional dependency handling. The fallback functions are benign, merely informing users about missing modules or raising errors. No dynamic code execution, network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated patterns are present.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Consistently zero across all reports, matching the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero, as the code does not perform any unsafe operations or handle untrusted data.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe package initialization script with no malicious or security-threatening features.",
