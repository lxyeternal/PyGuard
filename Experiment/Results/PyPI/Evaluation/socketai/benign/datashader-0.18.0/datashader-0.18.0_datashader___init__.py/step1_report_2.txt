{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up the import structure for a Python package, importing various modules and handling optional dependencies and commands.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (__future__, functools), third-party libraries (packaging, pandas, pyct), and internal package modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted input or data leading to system effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily through module imports and conditional imports; no untrusted data flows are visible.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of optional commands with fallback functions that return a string or raise an error; no direct malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. Use of try-except for optional dependencies is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script performs module imports and handles optional dependencies. It conditionally imports modules based on package versions and handles ImportError gracefully by defining fallback functions. There are no obfuscated code patterns or suspicious dynamic execution. The code structure is typical for setting up a package's namespace and optional features. No signs of malicious behavior such as system calls, network activity, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for a Python package with optional dependencies and does not contain malicious behavior. It mainly manages imports and optional features safely.",
