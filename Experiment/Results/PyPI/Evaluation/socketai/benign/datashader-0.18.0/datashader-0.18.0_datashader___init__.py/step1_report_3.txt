{
  "purpose": "The code primarily imports modules, sets up conditional imports, and defines fallback functions for missing dependencies in a Python package, facilitating API access and compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard library (__future__, functools), third-party libraries (packaging, pandas, pyct), and local modules (__version__, core, reductions, glyphs, pipeline, transfer_functions, data_libraries).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data is written to files, network, or system resources directly.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources or flows from input to sensitive operations are evident. The code conditionally imports modules and defines fallback functions, with no data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to handle missing optional dependencies, with fallback functions that return informational messages or raise errors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, managing imports, conditional compatibility, and fallback mechanisms. It imports essential modules and defines placeholder functions if dependencies are missing. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code features are present. The fallback functions simply inform users about missing dependencies. Overall, the code appears to be routine package initialization logic with safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It manages imports and dependencies carefully, providing user feedback if optional dependencies are missing. No security risks or malicious activities are detected.",
