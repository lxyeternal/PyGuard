{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for color conversions, color lookups, and colormap manipulations commonly used in data visualization.",
  "sources": "Color name to hex lookup, input parameters to functions (hex codes, color names, list slices), colormap selection parameters.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No data leakage or system effect points identified.",
  "flows": "Input data (color names, hex codes, list indices) flow through color conversion functions and colormap selection functions; no untrusted external sources or sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns. The code mainly deals with color data manipulation, with no network, file system, or environment variable access.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for color conversions: hex to RGB, color name to RGB, and list-based colormap selection. It includes several predefined color palettes. No external data sources or untrusted input handling that could be exploited. No network, file, or environment variable operations are present. The functions operate purely on in-memory data with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The colormap functions are straightforward, and the color lookup table is static. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and primarily focused on color data processing for visualization purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is a utility module for color management with no security risks observed.",
