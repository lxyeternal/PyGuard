{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for color conversion and colormap handling, including color lookup, conversion between hex, RGB, and color names, and colormap selection and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Color lookup dictionary, input parameters for color conversion functions, and colormap data arrays.",
  "sinks": "Color data output, functions returning color tuples, palette lists, and subset selections; no data leaks or external system effects detected.",
  "flows": "Color names or hex inputs from user or other modules → rgb() and hex_to_rgb() functions → output RGB tuples or hex codes; colormap functions → palette lists and subset slices.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration routines present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines static data structures (color lookup, colormaps) and functions for color conversion and palette manipulation. Functions validate input types, convert color formats, and manipulate color lists for visualization purposes. There are no network calls, file operations, or suspicious behavior. The functions operate solely within the provided data, and no external dependencies or system modifications are present. The color data and lookup dictionaries are standard and benign. Overall, the code is well-structured for visualization utilities, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of color utility functions and static data for color management and colormap handling. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a legitimate, benign utility module for visualization or plotting tasks.",
