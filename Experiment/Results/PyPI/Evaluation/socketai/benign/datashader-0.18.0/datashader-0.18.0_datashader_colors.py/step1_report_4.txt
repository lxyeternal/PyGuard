{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for color conversion, color lookup, and colormap manipulation, primarily used for color visualization in graphical applications.",
  "sources": "Color name lookup dictionary, input parameters for functions such as hex color strings, color names, and colormap indices.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable functions if used with untrusted input: hex_to_rgb, rgb, and colormap_select, which process color strings and indices. No network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Untrusted color input (string or tuple) flows through rgb() to hex_to_rgb() for conversion; indices and parameters flow into colormap_select() for subset and order manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. No obfuscated code, hidden network connections, or suspicious data handling. The functions handle color data only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a color lookup dictionary, functions for converting hex codes to RGB, and functions for interpreting colors by name or code, with proper validation. It includes color palettes and colormap data, with functions for selecting and reversing colormap segments. All functions operate solely on provided input parameters, with validation to prevent invalid conversions. No network, file, or system-altering operations are present. The use of data structures and functions appears standard for visualization purposes. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for color processing and colormap manipulation with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not include network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration features. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
