  "purpose": "Utility functions for color conversions, color lookup, and palette management, used for visualization tasks.",
  "sources": "Color name lookup dictionary, input parameters to functions (hex strings, color names, tuples), static palette data.",
  "sinks": "None; functions perform in-memory operations with input validation, no external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (color names, hex strings, tuples) are validated and converted within functions; no external or untrusted data flows to system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; static data and straightforward functions with proper validation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides color lookup, conversion, and palette functions with static data. It accepts untrusted input but performs validation, without external system interactions or malicious routines. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The functions are deterministic and safe, serving visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for color handling with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to potential misuse of untrusted input, but not malicious activity. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
