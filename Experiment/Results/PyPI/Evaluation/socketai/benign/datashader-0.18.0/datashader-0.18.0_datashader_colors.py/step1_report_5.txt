{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for color conversion, color lookup, and color palette manipulation, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads color names, hex color codes, and palette data from hardcoded dictionaries, lists, and variables. No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or functions that process untrusted external data inputs that could lead to data leaks, system modifications, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code converts color inputs (names or hex codes) to RGB tuples and manipulates color palettes. These conversions are purely computational with no external data flow or side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation, external network connections, or data exfiltration code. The palette data is static. The functions perform standard color conversions and palette manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles color lookups, conversions, and palette manipulations. It uses standard color data structures and conversion functions. No external data sources, network communication, or suspicious logic are present. The functions do not execute untrusted code, nor do they perform any system modification or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a utility library for visualization tasks with safe and benign operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for color and palette operations with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes static data and performs color conversions and manipulations.",
