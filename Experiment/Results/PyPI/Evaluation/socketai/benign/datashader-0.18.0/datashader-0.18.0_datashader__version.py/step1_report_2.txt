  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using static strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it assigns static version strings and tuples directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets module-level version variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and does not perform any unusual operations or contain hardcoded secrets beyond version info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated version module, setting version strings and tuples explicitly. It does not process external input, execute dynamic code, or interact with external systems. It contains no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is typical for type hints, with no impact on runtime behavior. The comments indicate it's generated by setuptools-scm, a common version management tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version info module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
