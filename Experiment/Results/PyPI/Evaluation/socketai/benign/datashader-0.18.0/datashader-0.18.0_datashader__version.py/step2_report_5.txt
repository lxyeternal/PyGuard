  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated version module.\n   - The code assigns static version strings and tuples, with no input, external data, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints is standard and does not impact runtime behavior.\n\n2. **Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - No report detects any malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n   - The code does not perform network operations, file I/O, or handle untrusted data.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is simple and correct; no errors or flaws are present.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment that this is benign, auto-generated version info.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence score is 1, indicating certainty about benign nature, which is justified.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as there's no vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions & Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent, based solely on static code analysis.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I agree with the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- The code poses no security concern.",
