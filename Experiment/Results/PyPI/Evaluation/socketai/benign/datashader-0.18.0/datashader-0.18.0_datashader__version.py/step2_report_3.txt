  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, auto-generated module defining version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with static values.\n   - It includes a conditional block for type hints (`TYPE_CHECKING`), which is standard practice and does not affect runtime behavior.\n   - There are no external data inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or any form of data processing.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - The code's purpose is purely to define and export version information, generated by `setuptools-scm`.\n\n3. **Logical Flaws or Errors in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, accurate, and thorough. They correctly note the static nature of the code, lack of external data handling, and benign purpose.\n   - No errors, flaws, or misinterpretations are evident in the reasoning.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score: 0\n     - `obfuscated` score: 0\n     - `securityRisk` score: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is auto-generated and safe, which is correct.\n   - No assumptions about malicious behavior are justified here, and the evidence supports that.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard version module with no security concerns.\n   - The scores reflect the actual risk level accurately.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, well-understood, and does not pose any security threat.",
