{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, no external data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of static version strings and tuples to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code contains straightforward version definitions without unusual patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets static version variables with hardcoded values. The presence of TYPE_CHECKING conditional introduces type hints but does not affect runtime behavior. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns are observed. The code appears standard and purpose-specific for versioning, with no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version information module, with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation detected.",
