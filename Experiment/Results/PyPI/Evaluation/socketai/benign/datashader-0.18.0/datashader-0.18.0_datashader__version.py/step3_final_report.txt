  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples; conditional type checking block.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, data flow, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated module for version info, with no dynamic behavior, external data, or network activity. It includes standard type hinting constructs that do not impact runtime. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports accurately assess the code's safety and do not require any modifications.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
