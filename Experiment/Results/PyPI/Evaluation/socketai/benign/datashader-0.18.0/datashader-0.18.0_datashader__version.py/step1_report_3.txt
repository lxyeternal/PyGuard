  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and provides version strings and tuples for package management.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples, including hardcoded version data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only assigns static version data without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses static, hardcoded version strings and types without any suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining version-related constants for a Python package. It includes a conditional block for type checking, which does not execute at runtime, and assigns static version data to variables. No input/output, external data, or sensitive information handling is present. There is no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply sets version variables for package management purposes.",
