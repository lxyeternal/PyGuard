  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, performance-oriented, and free of malicious behavior. The use of 'exec' is controlled and typical for such libraries. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal inherent risk due to dynamic code generation, which is acceptable given the controlled context."
