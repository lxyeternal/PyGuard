  "purpose": "Define configurations and logic for two-stage antialiasing aggregation in rendering or image processing.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the function parameter 'antialias_stage_2' which is externally provided; no direct data input handling within the code.",
  "sinks": "The function returns flags ('overwrite', 'use_2_stage_agg') used for downstream processing, but no direct sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'antialias_stage_2' flows into conditional logic to determine 'overwrite' and 'use_2_stage_agg' flags based on enum and tuple data; no untrusted external data processing or security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. Code uses standard Python features for configuration logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum and named tuple for configuring antialiasing stages. It includes a type-checking alias for structured data input. The function 'two_stage_agg' processes this input to decide whether to use a two-stage aggregation and whether to overwrite pixel values. The logic is straightforward, relying on enum comparisons and tuple unpacking, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious code. There are no data leaks, code injections, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration utility for rendering or image processing with no malicious intent or security risks. It is purely functional, with no external data manipulation or security vulnerabilities.",
