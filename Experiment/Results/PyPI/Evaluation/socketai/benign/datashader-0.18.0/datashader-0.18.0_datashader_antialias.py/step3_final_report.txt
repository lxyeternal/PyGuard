  "purpose": "Configuration utility for determining antialiasing aggregation modes in rendering.",
  "sources": "Input configuration tuple 'antialias_stage_2' containing combination enums, zero values, and flags.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal logic only processes configuration data.",
  "flows": "Reads 'antialias_stage_2' -> inspects enum combinations -> sets 'use_2_stage_agg' and 'overwrite' flags based on enum values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; straightforward logic; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums and a configuration tuple for antialiasing. The function 'two_stage_agg' checks if configuration exists, then inspects enum combinations to determine if two-stage aggregation is needed and whether to overwrite pixel values. It uses simple, deterministic logic without external system calls or data leaks. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is clear, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility for rendering, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess it as safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
