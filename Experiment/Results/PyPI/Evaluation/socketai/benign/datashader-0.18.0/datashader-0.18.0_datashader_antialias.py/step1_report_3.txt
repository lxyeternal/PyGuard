{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration structures and logic for second-stage antialiasing aggregation in graphics rendering.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; uses enum values and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, no network, file, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; control flow is static and configuration-based.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected. The code primarily performs logical configuration checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enums and named tuples for configuration. The function 'two_stage_agg' assesses the provided configuration data (antialias_stage_2) to determine whether to perform a 2-stage aggregation and whether to overwrite pixel values. It iterates through configuration tuples and makes logical decisions based on predefined enum values, with no input/output, network activity, or secret handling. No malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration logic module for graphics processing, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activity. It is purely computational and configuration-driven.",
