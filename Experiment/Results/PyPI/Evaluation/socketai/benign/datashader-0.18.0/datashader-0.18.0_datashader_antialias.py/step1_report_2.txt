  "purpose": "Define configurations and functions for second-stage aggregation in antialiased line rendering.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code defines data structures and a function operating on provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "The function processes input parameters related to antialiasing configurations, but does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "The function takes a tuple of configurations, determines aggregation mode and overwrite behavior, and returns boolean flags.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enumerations, a NamedTuple class, and a function for configuration logic related to antialiasing. The function inspects input configurations to decide whether to use a two-stage aggregation process and whether to overwrite pixel values, based solely on provided parameters. No input validation issues or security-sensitive operations are present. No data leaks, malicious network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, configuration utility for rendering processes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
