{
  "purpose": "A spatial data visualization and rasterization library supporting multiple data formats and optional dependencies, enabling spatial transformations, rasterization, and aggregation for visualization.",
  "sources": "Data read from pandas, dask, xarray, geopandas, spatialpandas, and their slices or attributes, with conditional imports for optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Data processed internally within data transformation pipelines; no external network, file, or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through spatial filtering, coordinate transformations, rasterization, and aggregation functions, without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected. Conditional imports are standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured spatial visualization library component, handling multiple data formats with safe optional dependency management. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Data flows are confined to internal processing, with no external data exfiltration or network activity. Validation functions and data handling follow standard practices. The optional dependencies are handled with care, and no dynamic code execution or external system calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source spatial visualization library component with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—are appropriate and conservative, reflecting the benign nature of the code and the handling of optional dependencies.",
