  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AST utility library with a notable security risk stemming from dynamic evaluation via eval() of source code obtained at runtime. While no malicious code is embedded, improper use or untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.6, reflecting moderate to high concern due to eval() usage."
