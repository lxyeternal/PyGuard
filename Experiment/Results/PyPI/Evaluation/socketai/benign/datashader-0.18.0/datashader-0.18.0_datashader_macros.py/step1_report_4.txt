  "purpose": "Utilities for manipulating and transforming Python Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), including function extraction, expansion of variable arguments, and AST to source code conversion.",
  "sources": "inspect.getsource() to retrieve function source code, ast.parse() to generate AST, copy.deepcopy() to duplicate AST, inspect.currentframe() and frame.f_back for frame inspection, and potentially unsafe eval() with compiled code objects.",
  "sinks": "eval() function with dynamically constructed scope, compile() producing code objects used in eval(), and source code generation or transformation functions.",
  "flows": "function_to_ast() retrieves source code -> ast.parse() creates AST -> expand_function_ast_varargs() modifies AST -> compile() creates code object -> eval() executes in dynamic scope -> function returned from eval().",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on dynamically compiled ASTs, which may execute arbitrary code if input functions are malicious; reliance on inspect.getsource() could leak sensitive source if used improperly. No explicit hard-coded credentials or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs AST parsing, transformation, and compilation of Python functions. It uses inspect.getsource() and eval() to dynamically reconstruct and execute functions from ASTs. The use of eval() in function_ast_to_function() can be risky if the source functions originate from untrusted sources, as it allows arbitrary code execution. However, there is no evidence of malicious code injection, backdoors, or malicious side-effects embedded within this module itself. The functions focus on safe transformation and expansion of function arguments and do not contain hidden or suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious intent, but the dynamic execution via eval() presents a potential security risk if used with untrusted inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended for AST manipulation and dynamic function reconstruction, with no clear malicious behavior. The main security concern is the use of eval() with compiled ASTs, which could execute malicious code if the source functions are untrusted. No malware, backdoors, or suspicious operations are detected within this module; however, caution is advised when using eval() with external or unverified functions.",
