  "purpose": "Utilities for manipulating the Abstract Syntax Tree of Python constructs, including function conversion, AST transformations, and dynamic evaluation.",
  "sources": "inspect.getsource() for source code retrieval, ast.parse() for parsing source into AST, and eval() for executing compiled AST code.",
  "sinks": "eval() function executing dynamically generated code, which can run arbitrary code if source is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Source code obtained via inspect.getsource() -> parsed into AST -> compiled into code object -> eval() executes code in current scope.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on source code obtained at runtime; no input validation or sandboxing; straightforward AST manipulation without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides AST utilities for function introspection, transformation, and expansion of variable args. The primary security concern is the use of eval() on source code retrieved via inspect.getsource(), which can execute malicious code if the source is compromised or untrusted. No malicious code or backdoors are embedded; the code's functionality is legitimate. The use of eval() introduces a significant security risk, especially in untrusted environments, but does not constitute malware itself. The risk is mitigated if source code is trusted and controlled. The code is not obfuscated, and no suspicious behavior is detected beyond the eval() usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AST utility library with a notable security risk stemming from dynamic evaluation via eval() of source code obtained at runtime. While no malicious code is embedded, improper use or untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.6, reflecting moderate to high concern due to eval() usage.",
