  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a copyright statement, a version string assignment, and a comment describing the source of truth for the version. There are no input, output, or processing mechanisms, nor any suspicious or malicious code constructs. The version is hardcoded, which is common practice for package versioning. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks are evident.",
