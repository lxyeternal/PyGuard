  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code simply assigns a version string to `__version__`.\n   - It contains only a comment with a copyright notice.\n   - There are no functions, dynamic code, input/output, or external data flows.\n   - The code is a standard pattern for version declaration in Python modules.\n\n2. **Anomalies Noted**:\n   - All reports mention the copyright year as 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming before 2025). This appears to be a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n   - No other anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n3. **Malware and Security Risks**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n\n4. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - The majority of reports assign a security risk and malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n\n5. **Potential for Change**:\n   - The only questionable aspect is the future copyright year. While it doesn't indicate malicious intent, it might warrant a minor security concern if it were to be exploited for misinformation or confusion. However, in this context, it's more likely a typo.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n**My own assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (low, mainly due to the future copyright date, which is likely a typo)\n\n**Final note**:\nThis snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration. The only noteworthy point is the future year in the comment, which should be corrected but does not pose a security threat.",
