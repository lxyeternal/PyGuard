  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the code and its functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only assigns a version string to `__version__` and includes a comment with a copyright notice.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output, or data flow is present.\n   - The code is a standard version declaration pattern.\n\n2. **Anomalies and observations:**\n   - The only noted anomaly across reports is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming it's before 2025). This is likely a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n   - No suspicious or obfuscated code, no hidden mechanisms, no external data sources, or code execution.\n\n3. **Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The scores seem consistent and reasonable.\n\n4. **Assessment of risk scores:**\n   - Since there's no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities present, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on unfounded assumptions; all analyses correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and align with the code's actual content.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The only potential concern is the future year \"2025\" in the comment, which could be a typo or oversight. While not malicious, it might warrant a quick review or correction to avoid confusion.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, thorough, and appropriately assess the code as benign. No changes to scores are necessary. The code is a typical, harmless version declaration with no security risks.",
