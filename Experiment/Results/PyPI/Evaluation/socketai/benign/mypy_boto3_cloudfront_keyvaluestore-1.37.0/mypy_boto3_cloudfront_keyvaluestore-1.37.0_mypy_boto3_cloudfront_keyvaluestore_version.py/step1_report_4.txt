  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "The assignment of __version__ = \"1.37.0\".",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are used or processed.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows or processing occurs beyond setting a static variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains only a version string assignment and a comment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a comment indicating authorship and purpose, followed by a simple assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious or unusual code constructs. This is a typical pattern for version declaration in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for version management, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
