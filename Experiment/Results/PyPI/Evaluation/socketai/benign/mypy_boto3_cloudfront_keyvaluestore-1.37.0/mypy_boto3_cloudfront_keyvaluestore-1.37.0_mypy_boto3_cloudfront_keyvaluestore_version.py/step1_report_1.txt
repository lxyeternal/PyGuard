  "purpose": "Define and store the version string of a software component.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow or external data input.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways identified.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with future date (2025) inconsistent with current year; no other unusual code or hidden mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string variable '__version__' to '1.37.0'. The only other statement is a comment with a copyright note dated 2025, which is inconsistent with the present date (assuming current date is before 2025). There are no functions, no dynamic code execution, no data handling, or network activity. The code appears to be a standard version declaration with a potential typo or future-dated comment, which is not malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines a version identifier and includes a copyright comment with an inconsistent future year. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
