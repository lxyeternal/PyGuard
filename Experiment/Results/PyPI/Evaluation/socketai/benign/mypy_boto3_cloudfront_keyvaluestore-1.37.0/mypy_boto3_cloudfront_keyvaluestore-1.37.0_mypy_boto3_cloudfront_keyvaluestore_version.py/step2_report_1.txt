  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue Present?**: The code does contain only a version assignment and a comment. No malicious code or obfuscation is present.\n   - **Anomaly**: The copyright year is 2025, which is inconsistent with the current date (assuming before 2025). This is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — Correct, no malicious activity.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct, code is straightforward.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — Appropriate, no security concern.\n   - **Conclusion**: The report's reasoning is sound. The only anomaly is the future date, which isn't security-relevant.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue Present?**: Same as above; simple version declaration.\n   - **Anomaly**: Same future copyright year, but no malicious implications.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — Correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — Correct.\n   - **Conclusion**: Accurate assessment.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue Present?**: No. The code is just a version string with a comment.\n   - **Anomaly**: Future copyright year.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — Correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — Correct.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid assessment.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue Present?**: No. Standard version assignment.\n   - **Anomaly**: Same future year comment.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — Correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — Correct.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue Present?**: No. Simple, static version string.\n   - **Anomaly**: Same future date in comment.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — Correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 — Correct.\n   - **Conclusion**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, static version declaration.\n- The only notable anomaly across all reports is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present in any snippet.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 for all, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 for all, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: 0 for all, since no security risks are identified.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions.** The only minor adjustment might be to note that the future date is likely a typo, but it doesn't affect security assessment.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
