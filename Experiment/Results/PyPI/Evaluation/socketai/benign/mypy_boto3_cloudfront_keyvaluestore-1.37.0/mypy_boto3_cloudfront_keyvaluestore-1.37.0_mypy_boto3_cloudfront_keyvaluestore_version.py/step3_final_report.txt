  "purpose": "Define the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "The comment containing the copyright notice and the assignment to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns a static string to __version__, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future year '2025' in the comment, which is likely a typo or oversight.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with a comment. It contains no dynamic code, input/output, or external data handling. All reports correctly identify the code as benign. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not imply malicious intent. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity of the code. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The only issue is the future year in the comment, likely a typo, but it does not impact security. All scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
