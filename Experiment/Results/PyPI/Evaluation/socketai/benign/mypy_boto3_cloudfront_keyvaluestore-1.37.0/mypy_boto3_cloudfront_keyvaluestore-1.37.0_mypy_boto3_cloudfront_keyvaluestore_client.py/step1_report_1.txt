  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the cloudfront-keyvaluestore service, providing a structured interface to AWS SDK functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class attributes; method parameters",
  "sinks": "Method calls to AWS services via boto3 client methods; generation of presigned URLs",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into methods, potentially including untrusted data, which then are used in AWS SDK calls or URL generation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily defines a client interface and relies on external libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules to define a boto3 client wrapper with typed method signatures. It creates a client class with methods to interact with AWS cloudfront-keyvaluestore, including URL generation and pagination. No indications of malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or unexpected behaviors are present. The methods are straightforward wrappers around boto3, and the code does not contain any network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured client interface definition for AWS SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly provides type annotations and method signatures for interaction with AWS services.",
