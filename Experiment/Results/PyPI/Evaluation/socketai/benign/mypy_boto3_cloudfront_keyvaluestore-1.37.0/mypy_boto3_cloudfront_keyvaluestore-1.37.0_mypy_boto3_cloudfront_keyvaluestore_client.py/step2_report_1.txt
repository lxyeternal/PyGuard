  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a standard type annotation and client class definition for the AWS cloudfront-keyvaluestore service. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely a stub with no signs of malicious activity. The low risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given that it's a client interface.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a legitimate SDK stub with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No suspicious logic or code. The low risk score is justified.  \n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious or suspicious features.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0  \n- **Assessment:** The risk score could be slightly increased to 0.1 to reflect that it's an SDK stub, but overall, it's minimal. The malware score is correctly zero.  \n- **Verdict:** Slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.1) could be more accurate, but current is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward, type-annotated AWS SDK client wrapper, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or obfuscated code detected.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** The code provides a standard client interface with no malicious activity or suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical SDK stub.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All agree on 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** The majority are at 0.1, reflecting minimal risk typical of SDK stubs. This is reasonable, as the code does not perform any untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub for AWS CloudFront Key Value Store, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My personal estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0.1 to 0.2, but 0.1 is acceptable)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is benign, and the scoring aligns well with its nature as a type-annotated SDK interface. No adjustments needed.",
