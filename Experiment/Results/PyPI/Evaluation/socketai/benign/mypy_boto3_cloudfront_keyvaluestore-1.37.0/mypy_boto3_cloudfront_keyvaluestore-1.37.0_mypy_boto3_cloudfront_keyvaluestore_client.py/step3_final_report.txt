  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS cloudfront-keyvaluestore service, serving as a structured SDK interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore, local type definitions, and version checks for standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters such as Params, kwargs, and URL generation functions, which handle data passed to AWS API calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into SDK methods, which invoke AWS API endpoints; no untrusted data is processed internally.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; straightforward SDK stub.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface with type annotations, designed for AWS CloudFront Key Value Store. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No malicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The parameters that accept untrusted data are typical for SDK wrappers and do not indicate malicious intent. The exception classes and method signatures follow standard patterns, and version checks ensure compatibility. Overall, the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious SDK stub for AWS CloudFront Key Value Store, with no suspicious or malicious features. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its nature as a type-annotated interface. No modifications are necessary.",
