{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with the cloudfront-keyvaluestore service in boto3, providing structured access to AWS API calls.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements, sys.version_info, and type definitions from other modules. It does not process external untrusted input directly.",
  "sinks": "The code defines methods for AWS API calls that can potentially send or receive data, but these are standard SDK methods with no indication of malicious data handling or exfiltration.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the methods wrap AWS API calls without custom data processing or insecure handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual constructs are present. The code appears to be a straightforward SDK stub wrapper with proper type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for an AWS service client. It imports modules safely, checks Python version compatibility, and defines exception types and client methods according to the AWS SDK. No data processing, input handling, or external data manipulation occurs outside standard SDK usage. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The class methods are designed for typical API interactions with AWS services, with no indications of data leakage or hidden malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK client stub with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as a type-annotated interface for AWS API calls related to cloudfront-keyvaluestore. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
