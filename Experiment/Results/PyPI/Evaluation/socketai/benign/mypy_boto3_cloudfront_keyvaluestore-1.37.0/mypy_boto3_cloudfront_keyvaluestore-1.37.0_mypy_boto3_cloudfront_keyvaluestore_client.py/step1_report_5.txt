  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the cloudfront-keyvaluestore service, providing a structured interface for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (sys, typing), botocore modules, and local modules (.paginator, .type_defs). No external or user inputs are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Methods that could potentially generate URLs (generate_presigned_url), or interact with AWS services (delete_key, describe_key_value_store, get_key, list_keys, put_key, update_keys). No indication of malicious data sinks such as network exfiltration or data theft.",
  "flows": "Method calls act as sources and sinks; for example, generate_presigned_url produces a URL potentially containing untrusted parameters, but it is a standard AWS operation. Data flows are internal API calls without evident malicious data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Code structure follows standard boto3 stubs conventions. No use of eval, exec, or obfuscated constructs. The only dynamic code is type checking based on Python version, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and a client interface for AWS CloudFront Key-Value Store service. It imports necessary modules, defines exceptions, and a class with methods matching AWS SDK operations. No evidence of data leakage, malicious URL generation, or backdoors. All methods align with documented AWS SDK behaviors. The code does not include any hidden or malicious code patterns. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured SDK stub.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious SDK interface definition for AWS CloudFront Key-Value Store. It contains no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. The structure and content follow conventional SDK patterns, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
