  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type annotations and client class for AWS SDK.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, no suspicious patterns. Purely a structured interface.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (minimal, typical for SDK code)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a standard SDK stub with no malicious activity. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: SDK stub with type annotations.\n- Analysis: No suspicious logic; standard pattern.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a straightforward SDK interface. The security risk score appears justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Client interface for AWS service.\n- Analysis: No dynamic code execution, no malicious patterns.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Confirmed as a standard SDK stub, with no signs of malicious behavior. The security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: SDK client stub.\n- Analysis: No malicious data handling or suspicious logic.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical SDK wrapper. The low security risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: SDK interface with URL generation.\n- Analysis: No malicious URL parameters or data exfiltration signs.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Obfuscated: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard SDK stub, with no malicious intent. The risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the code is purely SDK interface with no data processing or external inputs that could be exploited, a low risk score (~0.1) is justified. The reports' scores are consistent with this.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent security considerations in SDK code)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely interface/typing definitions for AWS SDK, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
