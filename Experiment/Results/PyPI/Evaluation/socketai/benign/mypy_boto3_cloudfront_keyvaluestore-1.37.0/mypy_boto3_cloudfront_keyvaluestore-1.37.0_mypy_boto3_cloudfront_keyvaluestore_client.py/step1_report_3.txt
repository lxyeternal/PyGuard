{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python client interface for interacting with the CloudFront Key Value Store service, including exception handling, method signatures, and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property accessors.",
  "sinks": "None identified that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious effects. Methods are standard API call signatures with no embedded execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Method parameters pass through to AWS SDK calls; no explicit source-to-sink data flows identified within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flow. The code appears to be a standard SDK interface definition with detailed typing annotations and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured Python module providing type annotations and API method signatures for a specific AWS service client. It imports necessary modules, defines exception classes, and declares client methods with appropriate typing. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. All components serve as a clear, standard SDK interface, with documentation links for further reference.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a legitimate, standard SDK interface definition for AWS CloudFront Key Value Store client. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
