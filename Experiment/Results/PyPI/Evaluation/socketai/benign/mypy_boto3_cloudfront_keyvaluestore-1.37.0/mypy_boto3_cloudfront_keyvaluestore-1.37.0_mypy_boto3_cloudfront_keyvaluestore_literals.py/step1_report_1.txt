{
  "purpose": "Define string literals for various AWS service names and paginator identifiers to ensure type safety and clarity in code that interacts with AWS SDKs.",
  "sources": "The code sources input data primarily from static string literals assigned to variables and imported modules. It also reads the Python version information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sink points where untrusted or external data is processed or executed. It primarily declares constants and type annotations.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, checking Python version for conditional imports, and assigning string literals to type alias variables. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, focusing on type annotations and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a set of type annotations for AWS service names, including conditional importing of 'Literal' based on Python version. It defines numerous string literal constants for various AWS services and related entities, which are used for type safety. There are no data processing, user input handling, or code execution features present. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected. The code is purely declarative, aiming to improve code quality and developer experience.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module defining constants and type annotations for AWS service names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward utility module for type safety, with no security concerns.",
