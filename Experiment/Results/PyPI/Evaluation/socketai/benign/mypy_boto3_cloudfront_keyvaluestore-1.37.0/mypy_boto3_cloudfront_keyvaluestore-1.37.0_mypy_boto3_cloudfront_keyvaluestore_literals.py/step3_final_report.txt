  "purpose": "Static type annotations for AWS service name literals and paginator identifiers, intended to improve type safety and developer experience in Python code.",
  "sources": "Constant string literals, conditional import of Literal based on Python version, no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "sinks": "None; purely static definitions used for type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or dynamic execution; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year '2025' is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal definitions for AWS services, with conditional import for compatibility. No dynamic code, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The future date in the copyright is suspicious but benign, likely a placeholder or typo. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-documented, and serves as a utility for type safety without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and serves as a set of type annotations for AWS SDKs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
