  "purpose": "Define string literals for various AWS service names and paginator identifiers used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Static string definitions; imports of 'sys' and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and consists solely of constant literal definitions. The copyright date '2025' is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then declares multiple constant string literals representing AWS service names and paginator identifiers. No dynamic execution, external input, or data processing is present. The code is purely declarative, with no obfuscated constructs or hidden behaviors. The presence of a future date in the copyright statement does not indicate malicious intent but is somewhat suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign static declaration of string literal types for type annotations related to AWS SDK service names. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk detected. It appears to be a normal part of type stub definitions for type checking.",
