  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its intent, and the potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static string literal definitions used for type annotations.\n- Conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- No data is processed from external or untrusted sources.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or input handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (October 2023). This is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious.\n\n**Security implications:**\n\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a set of constants for type safety.\n- No malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or code that could be exploited.\n- The presence of extensive AWS service name lists is typical for SDK type stubs.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it does not pose a security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS service names.\n- No security concerns, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### My final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static type declaration module with no dynamic behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. The future date in the copyright is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and serves a purely utility purpose for type safety in AWS SDK integrations.",
