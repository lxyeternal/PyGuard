  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS service literal identifiers, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string literals used for AWS service names and pagination identifiers; no input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other security issues.",
  "flows": "Since the code consists solely of constant literal definitions, there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code contains standard type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The large list of service names appears to be a static reference dataset.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple constant literals representing AWS service names and pagination identifiers. These are purely static, predefined strings intended for type hinting and documentation purposes. There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or code constructs that could be malicious. The extensive list of AWS service names does not contain any hidden code or malicious content; it functions as a static lookup set. No external code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present. Overall, the code appears to serve a utility purpose with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static type annotation module providing string literal definitions for AWS services. It contains no malicious behavior, no malicious code, and no security risks. It is a benign utility module with standard Python compatibility handling.",
