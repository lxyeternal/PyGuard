  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS CloudFront Key-Value Store service literals and related service names for type safety in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys' module and conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'; definitions of string literal types for various AWS service names.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling, user input, or data output; all definitions are static constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all variables are statically assigned string literals.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static type aliasing by defining string literal types for AWS service names. It uses conditional imports to support different Python versions. There are no input/output operations, network calls, or data processing. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs are present. The license and documentation comments are benign and serve the purpose of documentation and type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static type definition module for AWS service string literals. There is no malicious or suspicious behavior present. It appears to be a benign, purely declarative code intended for type safety in client code.",
