  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various AWS service literal names used in boto3-stubs for type safety and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions assigned to variables, import statements, conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no user input handling, no data transmission, no file or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely declarative, defining string literal types; no unusual or suspicious code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script establishes type aliases for AWS service names, paginator names, and resource service names using Python's Literal type for type safety. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice. There are no data sources or sinks, no network or file operations, and no dynamic code. The content is solely static definitions for type hints. No potential malicious or suspicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation module providing AWS service name literals. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The content is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
