  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security issues, anomalies, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literals for AWS service names, no external or untrusted data involved.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or anomalies; code is purely static.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, serving as type annotations with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct, no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate, no security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static definitions for AWS service names, no external data.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type aliasing, standard practice, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static string literals, conditional import, no external data.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow, no anomalies.  \n- **Observation:** The copyright date is \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to current dates, possibly indicating a placeholder or a typo, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely static declarations, benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The future date is slightly suspicious but not malicious; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static definitions, no external data.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No dynamic or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard type annotations, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static string literals, no external data.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No data flow or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static definitions for type safety, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, as the code is purely declarative, with no external data handling, dynamic execution, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code in all reports is a set of static type annotations and constants for AWS service names, intended to improve type safety and developer experience. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor point is the future copyright date in report 3, which is not malicious but slightly unusual.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security concerns.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are appropriate.",
