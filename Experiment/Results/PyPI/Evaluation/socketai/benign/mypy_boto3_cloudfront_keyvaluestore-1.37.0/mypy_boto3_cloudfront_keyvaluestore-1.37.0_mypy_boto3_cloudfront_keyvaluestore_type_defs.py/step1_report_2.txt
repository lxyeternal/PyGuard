  "purpose": "Define type annotations for cloudfront-keyvaluestore service type definitions for better type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Static type definitions; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code solely declares types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely type definition declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code strictly contains type annotations and imports with no executable or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type definitions using TypedDict for a specific AWS service. It includes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, which is standard practice. There are no functions, data processing, external data handling, or code execution paths. All classes are type annotations, and there are no indicators of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The only notable aspect is the extensive use of type hints to enforce data structure schemas, which is benign. The copyright notice and documentation link do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a static type definition module with no executable logic or runtime behavior. It poses no security threat or malicious intent, serving solely as type annotations for better code safety.",
