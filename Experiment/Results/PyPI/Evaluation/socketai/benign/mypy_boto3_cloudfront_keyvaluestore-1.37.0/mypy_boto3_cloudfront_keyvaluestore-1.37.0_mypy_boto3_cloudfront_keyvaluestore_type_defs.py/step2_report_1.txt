  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static type definitions using TypedDict.\n- No runtime code, data processing, external data handling, or executable logic.\n- The code includes conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate static type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues and logic:\n\n**Presence of issues in code:**\n- The code is purely type annotations and data structures, with no executable or dynamic code.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious behavior can be introduced through static type definitions alone.\n- The conditional imports are standard for compatibility and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or mistakes are evident.\n- The code appears well-structured, consistent, and adheres to Python typing best practices.\n- The use of `NotRequired` from `typing_extensions` for optional fields is appropriate.\n- The documentation and copyright info do not impact security.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The overall risk scores are 0 or 0.5, which aligns with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n**Justification for scores > 0.5:**\n- Since all code is static type definitions with no runtime or dynamic elements, a score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious code is present.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or attack vectors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Malware concerns:** None of the reports find or suggest malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation or malicious hiding techniques are present.\n- **Compatibility logic:** The conditional imports are standard and do not introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Confidence:** 1 (full confidence in the benign nature)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS CloudFront key-value store service. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe and poses no security threat.",
