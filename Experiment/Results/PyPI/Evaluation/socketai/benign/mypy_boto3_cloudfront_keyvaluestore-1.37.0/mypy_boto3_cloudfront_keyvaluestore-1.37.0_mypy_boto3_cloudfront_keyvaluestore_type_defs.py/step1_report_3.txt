{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for cloudfront-keyvaluestore service data structures for use with boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, datetime, builtins, typing, typing_extensions; and all class and variable definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic execution, network calls, file I/O, or data leaks present. No untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard practice. No suspicious or unusual code constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions using TypedDict for data structures related to cloudfront key-value store operations. It imports modules carefully with version checks, employs standard Python type hinting techniques, and defines data types with optional fields where appropriate. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data manipulation occurs. The code is purely declarative, serving as type hints and documentation aid. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign set of type definitions for boto3 cloudfront key-value store service. It appears to be standard, safe, and intended solely for static type checking. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk identified.",
