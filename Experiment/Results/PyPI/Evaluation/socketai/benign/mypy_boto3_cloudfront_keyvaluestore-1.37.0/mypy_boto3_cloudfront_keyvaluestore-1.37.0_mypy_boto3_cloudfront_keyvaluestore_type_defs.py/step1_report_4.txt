  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for cloudfront-keyvaluestore service, mainly used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; only type definitions and static documentation references.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows, as this is purely type annotation and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard for defining TypedDicts with optional fields, and includes conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines TypedDict classes for data modeling in a Python SDK context, with no execution or runtime logic. The conditional imports based on Python version are typical for compatibility, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are present. No external data or commands are executed, and the code does not handle input or perform network operations. It strictly provides type annotations for SDK usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign type definition module with no malicious intent. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It is solely used for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
