{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations and data structure definitions for the AWS CloudFront Key-Value Store service, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only through type annotations and class definitions; no runtime data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code only defines data schemas without runtime or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present; standard conditional imports are used for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDict class definitions with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or dynamic code. The documentation and copyright notice do not impact security. The absence of runtime code, network activity, or data processing indicates no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type definitions for AWS SDK schemas. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
