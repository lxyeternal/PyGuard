  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static type annotations and data structure definitions for the `cloudfront-keyvaluestore` service.\n- The code consists of `TypedDict` classes, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling is present.\n- No evidence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or backdoors.\n- The code is purely declarative, intended for static type checking and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports agree that the code is static type definitions with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correct, following standard practices for Python type annotations, with proper conditional imports for compatibility.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0.\n   - **Justification:** The code contains only static type definitions, no executable code, no network or file I/O, no data leaks, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - **Conclusion:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate and should remain.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0.\n   - **Justification:** No obfuscation, no hidden or suspicious code, no code hiding techniques.\n   - **Conclusion:** The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**\n   - All reports assign 0.\n   - **Justification:** No runtime code, no external data handling, no secrets, no vulnerabilities.\n   - **Conclusion:** The security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of static type annotations.\n- No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for SDKs, with no executable or dynamic components. The extensive documentation and conditional imports are standard practices, not indicators of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, safe, and serves solely for static type checking. No changes to the reported scores are necessary.",
