  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for cloudfront-keyvaluestore service, used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static type annotations and docstrings; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the code only defines data types.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; only static type annotations and class definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are detected. The code uses standard Python type annotations, conditional imports based on Python version, and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions using TypedDict, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation. There are no data processing, external data handling, or executable code that could be malicious. The only notable aspect is the conditional import logic based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of type annotations and data structure definitions for a specific AWS service, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
