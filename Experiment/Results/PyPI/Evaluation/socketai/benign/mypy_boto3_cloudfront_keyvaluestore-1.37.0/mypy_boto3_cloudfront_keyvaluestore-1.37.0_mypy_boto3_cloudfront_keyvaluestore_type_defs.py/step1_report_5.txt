  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for cloudfront-keyvaluestore service.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines data classes for request/response schemas; reads system version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; primarily type definitions and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hidden code, or obfuscated logic detected; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for request and response data structures using TypedDict. It conditionally imports modules based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. There are no data leaks, code injections, or network operations. The code is purely for static type checking and does not execute any runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of type definitions intended for static analysis and API schema validation. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident.",
