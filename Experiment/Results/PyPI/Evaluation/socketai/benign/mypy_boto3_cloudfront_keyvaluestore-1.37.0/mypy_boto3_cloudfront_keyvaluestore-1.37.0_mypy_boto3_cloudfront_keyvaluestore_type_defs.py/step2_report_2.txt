  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations for cloudfront-keyvaluestore; purely static.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling or external data processing.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard conditional imports.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is solely type definitions with no executable or malicious code. The presence of a copyright notice and documentation link does not introduce security concerns.  \n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scoring are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type annotations for better safety and clarity.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic or external data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** Standard pattern; no suspicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely static, type declaration code with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, aligned with the code's nature.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations for boto3 stubs; no runtime data.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external input.  \n- **Anomalies:** Conditional imports are standard.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, fitting the static nature.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct and justified.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations and documentation; static definitions.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data or external sources.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard type definitions.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the code.  \n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions for request/response schemas; no dynamic code.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling or execution.  \n- **Anomalies:** Standard conditional imports, no obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static type annotations with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type definitions with no executable, network, or data-processing components that could be malicious.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious or suspicious code.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK data structures, with no security concerns. The scores and conclusions across all reports are consistent and justified.",
