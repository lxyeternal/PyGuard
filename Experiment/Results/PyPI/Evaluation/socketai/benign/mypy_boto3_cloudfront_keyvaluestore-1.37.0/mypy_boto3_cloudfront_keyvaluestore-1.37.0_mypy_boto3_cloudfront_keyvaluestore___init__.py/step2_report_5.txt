  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple module that imports classes, defines a class alias, and sets an `__all__` list.\n- The code includes documentation strings with usage examples and a copyright notice.\n- No dynamic data handling, network calls, or execution of untrusted data are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for a Python SDK interface module.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Main interface and documentation.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no malicious intent.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Interface, documentation, class alias.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, safe example code.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero, but justified as minimal risk due to documentation presence).\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable. No malicious concern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous, straightforward interface.\n- **Analysis:** No issues, safe pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment, no anomalies.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar, no anomalies.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code?** No.\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes. All reports correctly identify no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal or zero security risk.\n- **Is there any assumption-based vulnerability?** No. The code is static and benign.\n- **Is the malware score justified?** All are zero, which is correct.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign static module.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero, indicating no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 for documentation, but zero is acceptable)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly assess the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. The code is a straightforward module interface with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
