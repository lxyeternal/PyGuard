  "sources": "Import statements from .client and .paginator modules.",
  "sinks": "None directly present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules, assigns a class to a variable, and defines an export list. It contains documentation and type hints for ease of use. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling are present. No anomalies or signs of malicious activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module interface for a Python SDK or library component, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply organizes imports and exports for use by other modules.",
