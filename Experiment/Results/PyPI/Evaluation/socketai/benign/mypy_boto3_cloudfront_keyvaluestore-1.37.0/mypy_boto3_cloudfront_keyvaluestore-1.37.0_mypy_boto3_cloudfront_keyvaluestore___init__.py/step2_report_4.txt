  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal module that imports local classes and functions, sets up some aliases, and provides documentation. \n- There are no dynamic behaviors, network calls, or data processing.\n- The documentation is straightforward, including usage examples.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a typical SDK or API wrapper module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. This aligns with the code content, which is just module setup and documentation.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1). These seem reasonable given the code content.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  0, appropriate given the clarity of the code.\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting negligible security risk. This is appropriate.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only minor concern could be the presence of a copyright notice with a future date (\"2025\"). This is not a security concern but might be an inconsistency or typo. However, it doesn't impact security assessments.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code is just an interface layer with no security implications.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious elements are present.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (a very low, almost negligible risk, perhaps just reflecting the presence of documentation and import statements, which are benign)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I agree with the assessments provided. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n- The code is a standard, safe module setup for an SDK or API client.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; they accurately reflect the security posture of this code snippet.",
