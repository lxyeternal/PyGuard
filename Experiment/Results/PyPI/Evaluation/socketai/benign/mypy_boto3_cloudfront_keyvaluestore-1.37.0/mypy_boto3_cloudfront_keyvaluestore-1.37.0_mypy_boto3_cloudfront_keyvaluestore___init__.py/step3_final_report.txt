{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python module interface for the cloudfront-keyvaluestore service, providing class imports, aliases, and documentation for users.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the module import statements and the documentation string, which contains usage examples.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code flow is static; it imports classes and sets up aliases without any data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for an SDK module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static Python module that imports local classes, defines a class alias, and sets an export list. The documentation string provides usage instructions. There are no dynamic operations, data processing, or external interactions. All security signals—malware, obfuscation, and risk—are absent or negligible. The code's benign nature is consistent with the reports, which correctly assign scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low or zero security risk. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are identified, and the code structure aligns with typical SDK modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard interface module with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The existing reports accurately reflect its benign nature, and no modifications to the scores or further analysis are necessary.",
