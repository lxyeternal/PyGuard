{
  "purpose": "Provides main interface and documentation for the cloudfront-keyvaluestore service, including imports and client initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), string literals in documentation, and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "Imports and assignments are static; no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of module setup, imports, and simple variable assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module interface with imports and documentation. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or execute dynamic code. The only potential concern is the presence of documentation and import statements, which are benign. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as an interface layer with no indications of malicious behavior.",
