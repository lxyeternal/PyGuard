  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python module 'mypy-boto3-cloudfront-keyvaluestore'.",
  "sources": "Reads static README.md file; imports pathlib and setuptools; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution; static data only.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> passes static data to setup() with package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup script with no dynamic input, network activity, or malicious code. It reads a local file and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The dependency condition is standard for compatibility and does not introduce risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is 1.0.",
