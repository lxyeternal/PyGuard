  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python module.\n- It reads a local README.md for the long description.\n- It uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and data files.\n- No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution.\n- No network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- The only dependency conditionally included is 'typing-extensions' for Python <3.12.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct, standard, and benign.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Security risks:** None detected; no untrusted data handling, no network activity, no credential management.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is static and straightforward.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws identified.\n- The report's conclusion that the script is benign and standard is accurate.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — the script poses no security risk.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The only potential concern could be if the package itself is compromised, but that is outside the scope of this script review.\n- The code reads a static file and calls setup(), which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the detailed review, the scores provided are appropriate and consistent with the code.**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
