{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging and distribution of the 'mypy-boto3-cloudfront-keyvaluestore' Python package, primarily for type annotations and stubs for boto3 CloudFront service.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package data for inclusion; imports setuptools and Path modules for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data exposure points are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no flow of untrusted data from source to sink is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a markdown file for documentation, and uses setuptools to define package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The only external dependencies are standard library and 'setuptools'. The 'install_requires' field conditionally includes 'typing-extensions' for Python versions below 3.12, which is standard. Overall, the code is a typical setup configuration without suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks. It simply manages package metadata and dependencies for distribution purposes.",
