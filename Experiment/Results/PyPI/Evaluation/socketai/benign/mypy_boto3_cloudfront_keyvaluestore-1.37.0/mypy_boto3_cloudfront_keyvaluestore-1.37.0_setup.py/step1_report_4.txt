{
  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-cloudfront-keyvaluestore package, used to configure package installation details.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports 'setup' from setuptools; reads environment variables through standard Python functions if any; no user input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setup()' to process package metadata; no data is sent or written to external locations or network connections within this code.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for description, then passes static metadata to 'setup()' without involving untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that imports standard libraries and defines package metadata. It reads a local README.md file to include as a long description, then calls 'setup()' with static parameters. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no code that could be malicious. It follows typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package setup operations with no suspicious code or data leakage.",
