  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-cloudfront-keyvaluestore package, used to configure and install the package with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, and imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; primarily configuration data.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md content, then calls setup() with static arguments; no untrusted data flows or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path to read a README.md file for the long_description, then invokes setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or external data is used dynamically. The install_requires conditionally includes 'typing-extensions' for older Python versions. No code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
