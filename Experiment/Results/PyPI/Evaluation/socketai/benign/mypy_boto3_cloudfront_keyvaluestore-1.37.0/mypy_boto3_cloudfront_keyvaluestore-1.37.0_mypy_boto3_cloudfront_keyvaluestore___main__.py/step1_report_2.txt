{
  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package providing information about boto3 CloudFrontKeyValueStore, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "targets": "The code outputs static package information; it does not process or utilize untrusted data beyond reading command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, it calls print_version() which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, it calls print_info() which writes package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package metadata. It checks for '--version' argument to determine output, otherwise displays static package information. There are no external data inputs beyond command-line arguments, and no sensitive operations, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple CLI interface to display package information. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
