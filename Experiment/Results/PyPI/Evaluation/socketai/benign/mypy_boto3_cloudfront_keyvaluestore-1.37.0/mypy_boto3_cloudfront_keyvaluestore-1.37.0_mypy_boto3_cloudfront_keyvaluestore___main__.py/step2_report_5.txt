  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info and version.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or untrusted input processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The code is straightforward and uses only standard library functions.\n\n**2. Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- No discrepancies or errors in the reasoning.\n- The analysis correctly identifies the code as a simple informational CLI utility.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to issues:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1.0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No need to adjust scores; they accurately reflect the benign assessment.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk score is also 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- No justification is needed for higher scores.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- Malware score remains at 0.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports are cautious and based on static analysis, which is appropriate.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the reports:**\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n- The scores accurately reflect the benign, static nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static CLI utility that outputs package info and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports and scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
