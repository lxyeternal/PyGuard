  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI script that outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only the standard library (`sys`) and performs straightforward operations:\n     - Checks if `--version` is in `sys.argv`.\n     - Prints static strings to `stdout`.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or handling of untrusted data.\n   - No obfuscation, no secrets, no backdoors, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Report Summaries and Validity:**\n   - All five reports agree that the script is benign, straightforward, and only outputs static information.\n   - They correctly identify that the script reads command-line arguments and writes to stdout.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious code, or security risks are found.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated and malware scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0.0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 is correct; code is clear and simple.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** 0.0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are detected.\n   \n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the static nature of the code and no hidden malicious intent.\n   - Given the code's simplicity, this assumption is valid.\n   - No evidence suggests any hidden malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Final Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign CLI utility for displaying package info.\n   - The scores provided in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe CLI script with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and align with the code's nature.",
