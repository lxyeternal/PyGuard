  "purpose": "This script serves as a command-line interface entry point that provides package information and version details to the user.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs data using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Output is sent to stdout; no external data sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' (source) triggers print_version() (sink), otherwise print_info() is called (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to output static package info and version data. It checks for '--version' in sys.argv and prints relevant info accordingly. The code is straightforward, with no untrusted data handling, no external network calls, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info and version. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It is safe to use.",
