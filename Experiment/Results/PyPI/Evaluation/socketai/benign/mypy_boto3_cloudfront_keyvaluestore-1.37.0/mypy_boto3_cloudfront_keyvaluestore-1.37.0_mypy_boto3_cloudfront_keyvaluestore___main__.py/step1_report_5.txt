  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a package, including version and documentation details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs data to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data to stdout)",
  "flows": "Command-line input (e.g., '--version') triggers printing functions that output static information",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI entry point that outputs package info and version. It reads command-line arguments to decide whether to print version or info, both are static texts. No untrusted data input, no external data fetching, no suspicious code patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The structure is straightforward and uses only standard library functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign output operations for CLI purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this code.",
