  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to stdout output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports only sys, checks for '--version' in sys.argv, and prints static package info or version. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The code is simple, with functions that output static strings, and no obfuscation or secrets. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are consistent with the code's behavior. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility that outputs package info and version. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further modifications are necessary.",
