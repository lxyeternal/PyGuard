  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.\n   - It reads command-line arguments via `sys.argv` and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or untrusted input handling is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is straightforward, with functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` that output static strings.\n\n   **Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and purely informational.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given in the Reports:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0.0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0.0 or 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0.0 or 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are 1.0, which is justified.\n\n   **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest scores are 0.0 for malware and security risk.\n   - Since the code is benign, no higher scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n   - They correctly state that no suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward, safe CLI utility that outputs static information.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring and analysis are justified.",
