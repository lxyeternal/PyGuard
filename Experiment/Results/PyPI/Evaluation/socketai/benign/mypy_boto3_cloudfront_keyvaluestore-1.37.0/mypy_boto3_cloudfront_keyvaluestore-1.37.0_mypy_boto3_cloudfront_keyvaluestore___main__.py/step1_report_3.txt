  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv --version leads to print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code solely prints static information.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for input/output operations. It defines two functions to print static package info and version. The main() function checks for a '--version' argument to decide which info to print. No external data sources, no data manipulation, and no network activity or suspicious code paths. The code is straightforward, with no anomalies or obfuscation. It serves as a simple CLI utility to display static package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and only outputs static package-related information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard CLI script for informational purposes.",
