  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments -> conditional check -> output via sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code performs simple informational printing.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI tool that outputs package information or version based on command-line arguments. It uses standard library functions without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling beyond printing static strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The code structure is simple and clean, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility intended for informational purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears to be a safe and standard implementation.",
