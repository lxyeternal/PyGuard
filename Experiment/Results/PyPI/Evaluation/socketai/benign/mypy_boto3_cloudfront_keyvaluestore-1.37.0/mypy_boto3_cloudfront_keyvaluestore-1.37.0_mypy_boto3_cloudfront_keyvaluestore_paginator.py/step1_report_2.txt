{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class for the cloudfront-keyvaluestore service client, facilitating typed pagination support for listing keys.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules, system version info for conditional imports, and user input via function arguments in 'paginate'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code mainly defines classes and type annotations without executing external commands or handling sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The 'paginate' method receives kwargs, which are used internally within boto3's pagination system; no direct data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes version-dependent imports and standard class inheritance. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are detected. No obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, class inheritance, and method definition for a paginator class. It imports necessary modules, defines a subclass, and annotates the 'paginate' method with appropriate types. There are no suspicious data flows, no hardcoded credentials, or potentially malicious code patterns. The code relies on external boto3 and botocore libraries for functionality, with no internal logic that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a paginator class with type annotations for a specific AWS service. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate SDK extension code.",
