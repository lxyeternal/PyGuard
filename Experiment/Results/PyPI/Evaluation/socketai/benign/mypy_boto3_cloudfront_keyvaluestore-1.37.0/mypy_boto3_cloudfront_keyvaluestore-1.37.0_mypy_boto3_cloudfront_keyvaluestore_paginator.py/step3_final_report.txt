  "purpose": "Type annotations and class extension for boto3 paginator support in the cloudfront-keyvaluestore service.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, sys.version_info, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' method forwards kwargs to the parent Paginator; no external data sinks or leaks.",
  "flows": "kwargs received in 'paginate' flow into the parent class method without external or malicious processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass 'ListKeysPaginator' extending a generic Paginator with type annotations. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' based on Python version, and the 'paginate' method simply forwards kwargs to the parent class. No data processing, network activity, or external command execution occurs. The code is purely structural, intended for type safety and SDK support, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a paginator class for boto3, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
