{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definition for the cloudfront-keyvaluestore service client, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's Python version info, imports from botocore and typing modules, and loads type definitions from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code mainly defines classes and imports modules.",
  "flows": "Imports (sources) are used to define class inheritance and method annotations; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and conditionally imports Unpack based on Python version. It defines a paginator class extending a generic Paginator with type annotations. No external data is fetched or written; the code only defines structure and documentation. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware-like activity are present. The presence of license and documentation comments is standard. The code's purpose is to facilitate type-safe pagination for a specific AWS service client.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate, and well-structured module for boto3 stubs with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for type annotations and class definitions without executing any potentially dangerous operations.",
