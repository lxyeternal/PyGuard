  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package named 'SPF2IP'.\n- No reports identify any suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code.\n- All reports agree that the code only reads a README file, sets package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- Dependencies ('dnspython' and 'ipaddress') are common for network-related Python packages.\n- Entry point 'SPF2IP=SPF2IP:main' suggests a CLI tool, but no code for 'main' is provided here, which is typical for setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **does not** contain any malicious or suspicious logic.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup script.\n\n### Potential issues or concerns:\n- The reports are consistent and do not raise any red flags.\n- Since the setup script is static and reads only trusted files and hardcoded strings, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The only minor point is that the 'ipaddress' module is included as a dependency; in Python 2, this module is not built-in, so its inclusion makes sense. In Python 3.3+, 'ipaddress' is part of the standard library, so the explicit dependency might be redundant but not malicious.\n\n### Scoring:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- All reports correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The purpose and sources are benign; no suspicious data flows or sinks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, the code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.** The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, safe, and typical for a Python package distribution.",
