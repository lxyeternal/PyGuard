  "purpose": "Configure the setup and installation parameters for the Python package 'SPF2IP'.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.rst' file, package metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; setup configuration does not execute code with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for long description; no untrusted data flows into dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard setup tools.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python setuptools methods to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It reads a description file with specified encoding. No user input, network activity, or code execution based on external data is present. All modules and dependencies appear legitimate and typical for Python packaging. No suspicious behavior or malicious constructs observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It uses standard libraries and conventions for package distribution.",
