  "purpose": "Configure package metadata and setup for the SPF2IP Python module",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst for long description, importing setup, find_packages, open, path modules, and defining setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious effects",
  "flows": "Reading README file (source) to variable, then passing static data to setup function (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary setup utilities, reads a README file for description, and configures package metadata including dependencies and entry points. All data used is static or from trusted sources (filesystem files and hardcoded strings). There are no dynamic code evaluations, network operations, or obfuscated segments. The package configuration appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
