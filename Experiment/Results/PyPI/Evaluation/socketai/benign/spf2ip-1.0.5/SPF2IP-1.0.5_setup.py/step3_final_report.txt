{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the Python package 'SPF2IP', defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description; uses hardcoded package info; specifies dependencies 'dnspython' and 'ipaddress'; defines console script entry point.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads static file -> sets package metadata -> installs dependencies -> defines CLI entry point.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script for packaging. It reads a README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. Dependencies are standard for DNS and IP address handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores and assessments are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
