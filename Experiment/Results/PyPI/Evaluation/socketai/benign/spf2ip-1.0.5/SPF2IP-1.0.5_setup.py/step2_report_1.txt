  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports consistently state that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated segments. The code only reads a README file and defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n2. **Code Content and Logic:**  \n   The code is straightforward, typical for a Python package setup using setuptools. It does not process untrusted input, handle sensitive data, or perform any network operations. The dependencies ('dnspython' and 'ipaddress') are standard for DNS and IP address handling, respectively.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Mistakes:**  \n   No errors or flaws are apparent in the code. The setup configuration appears correct and conventional.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.  \n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**  \n   Since the code is purely for package setup, any assumptions about vulnerabilities are unfounded. The package's functionality (retrieving IPs from SPF records) is not implemented here; this is only the setup script.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content. The high confidence (1) across reports is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risks identified in setup script)  \n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Since the actual functionality (retrieving IPs from SPF records) is not present in this setup script, no security concerns related to that logic can be inferred here.\n- The package appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of suspicious elements.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided setup script is a standard, benign Python package configuration with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
