  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python module named 'SPF2IP' that retrieves IP addresses from SPF records.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description; reading module metadata from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only reads static files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data flows that could be exploited, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The package appears to be a legitimate distribution setup for a module related to SPF records.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and appears to be standard package distribution code.",
