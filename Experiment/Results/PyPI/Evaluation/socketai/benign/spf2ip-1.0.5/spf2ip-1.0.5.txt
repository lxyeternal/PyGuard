      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SPF/IP extraction utility with no malicious intent or malicious code. It performs DNS queries based on user input, which could be misused if malicious domains are supplied, but this is inherent to its purpose. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to DNS queries based on user input. Overall, the code is benign and appropriate for its intended use."
