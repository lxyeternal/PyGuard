{
  "purpose": "The script retrieves and processes DNS SPF records to extract IP addresses associated with a domain for either IPv4 or IPv6.",
  "sources": "dns_request_unicode function querying DNS TXT records; regex matching DNS response data; dns.resolver.query method; command-line arguments for domain and IP version input.",
  "sinks": "Returning extracted IP addresses; printing IP addresses to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input domain from command line -> dns_request_unicode retrieves TXT records -> regex extracts include statements and IPs -> DNS lookups for hostnames/IPs -> process and sort IP addresses -> output IP addresses.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses regex to parse DNS SPF records and resolves include directives and IP addresses without sanitization; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no suspicious network connections or file operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly focuses on extracting SPF-related IP addresses through DNS queries, handling various DNS record types and include directives. It includes proper exception handling for DNS resolution and IP address parsing, uses standard libraries, and does not perform any suspicious activities such as data exfiltration, network connections to unknown domains, or code execution from untrusted sources. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques are detected. The overall purpose is legitimate and aligns with standard DNS SPF record analysis. No indicators of malicious intent or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for extracting IP addresses from SPF DNS records without malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices and does not contain any suspicious or harmful code segments.",
