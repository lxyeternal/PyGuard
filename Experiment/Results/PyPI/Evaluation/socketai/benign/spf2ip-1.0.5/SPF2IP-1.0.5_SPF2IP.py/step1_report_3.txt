{
  "purpose": "The script extracts IP addresses associated with a domain's SPF records, including included domains, for IPv4 or IPv6.",
  "sources": "Reads input domain via command-line arguments; fetches DNS TXT records for SPF data; performs DNS queries for various record types (A, AAAA, MX, TXT).",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs resolved IP addresses to stdout; DNS queries could be targeted with malicious domain names; no data is sent over the network outside DNS queries.",
  "flows": "User supplies domain -> DNS TXT record retrieved -> SPF data parsed -> included domains processed recursively -> DNS queries for hostnames/IPs -> IP addresses collected and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; code structure is consistent with legitimate SPF processing. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. No external data leaks or unintended network communications identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs DNS resolution for SPF records, processes include mechanisms recursively, and extracts IP addresses from SPF entries, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. The logic appears to be a standard SPF parser. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. DNS queries are used solely for record retrieval, consistent with intended functionality. No unusual or suspicious code constructs or behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate SPF processing utility without malicious intent. It performs DNS queries to extract IP addresses from SPF records and their includes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
