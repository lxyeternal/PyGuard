  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided code, and evaluate the risk scores, malware potential, and logical consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code provides type annotations and interface definitions for the AWS WorkSpaces client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic or untrusted data handling; primarily static method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is a generated stub with documentation links.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report accurately identifies this as a safe, auto-generated SDK stub with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 (justified, as it's a static, safe interface).\n\n**Verdict:** The high risk score is justified given the nature of the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the class setup and type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual data processing or runtime logic; purely structural.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No malicious signs; standard SDK stub.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms the code is a legitimate, safe interface with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes the extensive method signatures and documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic or untrusted data handling; only method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard SDK stub.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely structural, with no runtime or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the type stub nature.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual data processing or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirmed as a safe, static SDK stub.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes the class with method signatures and type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No executable logic; only method signatures accepting untrusted parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious activity; standard SDK interface.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe SDK stub with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 1.0 justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a static, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS WorkSpaces.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The high security risk scores are justified given the nature of the code (interface/stub), which could be misused if combined with malicious payloads elsewhere, but in isolation, it is safe.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose as a static SDK stub, a risk score of 1.0 might seem high, but since it could be misused if malicious actors inject code into the environment or misuse the interface, maintaining a high risk score is justifiable.\n\n**However,** considering the code is purely a type stub with no runtime logic, I would personally assign a **risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2** to reflect that it is inherently safe but can be part of a larger attack vector if combined with malicious code elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (more precise, acknowledging potential misuse but no inherent maliciousness)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is a safe, static SDK interface with no malicious or obfuscated components.",
