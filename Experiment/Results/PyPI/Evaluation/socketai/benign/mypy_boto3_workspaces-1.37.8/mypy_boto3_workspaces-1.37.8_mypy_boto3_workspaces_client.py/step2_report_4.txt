  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code content, and evaluate the potential security implications, including malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a comprehensive, type-annotated interface for the AWS WorkSpaces client, primarily for static type checking. It notes the absence of executable logic, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The report concludes there's no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a generated stub with method signatures, type hints, and documentation links, with no runtime or malicious logic.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the class and method definitions, with no signs of malicious activity. It highlights the extensive type annotations and the absence of dynamic code or network operations.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard SDK stub, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the method signatures, type hints, and documentation, noting that the code is purely structural with no runtime logic or data processing. It states that no malicious behavior or sabotage is evident.\n\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is a static interface, with no executable or malicious components.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the type annotations, method signatures, and the absence of executable commands or dynamic code. It confirms that the code is a static type stub with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely structural for type checking.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that the code contains method signatures with untrusted data parameters but no actual data handling or network activity. It emphasizes the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a typical SDK interface, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a generated, static SDK stub for AWS WorkSpaces, containing no executable logic, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious behavior. The type annotations and method signatures are standard for such interface definitions.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, generated, and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities evident.\n\n**Final notes:** The code's purpose is to provide type safety and documentation for static analysis and IDE support. It does not perform any runtime operations or contain any executable payloads. The absence of dynamic code, network calls, or data processing confirms its safety.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, auto-generated type stub for the AWS WorkSpaces SDK, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores should remain at zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
