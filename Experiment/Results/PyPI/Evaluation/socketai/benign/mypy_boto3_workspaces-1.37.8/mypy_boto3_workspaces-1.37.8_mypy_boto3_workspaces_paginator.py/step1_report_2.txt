  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 workspaces client, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.paginate, custom type definitions from .type_defs, and the paginator class methods which call the underlying boto3 paginate functions.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods which accept **kwargs with specific types, passing them to the base Paginator's paginate method.",
  "flows": "User calls the paginate method with typed arguments, which are unpacked and passed to the base Paginator, then iterate over the results.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward and standard for boto3 stubs; no suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines typed paginator classes for each API operation, extending the generic Paginator. Type annotations are used to ensure correct input and output types. Conditional imports handle differences in Python versions. No external data fetching or network calls are present outside the typical boto3 pagination pattern. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present; the code's purpose is to provide type-safe wrappers for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 workspaces. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It functions solely to improve type safety and code completion support.",
