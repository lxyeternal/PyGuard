{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the boto3 workspaces service, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Read-only imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; no external input handling or user data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs directed to external systems; no evidence of data leaks, network connections, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Code defines classes and paginate methods that pass through input kwargs to underlying Paginator.paginate calls, with no data manipulation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscation; code appears to be standard boilerplate for boto3 type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines type aliases based on Python version, and creates subclasses of Paginator with overridden paginate methods. All classes and methods are standard for boto3 paginators with type annotations. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or hidden functionality. The code is well-structured and purpose-specific, serving to add type safety and documentation for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign type annotation and paginator class definition for boto3's workspaces service. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is purely for typing purposes and documentation.",
