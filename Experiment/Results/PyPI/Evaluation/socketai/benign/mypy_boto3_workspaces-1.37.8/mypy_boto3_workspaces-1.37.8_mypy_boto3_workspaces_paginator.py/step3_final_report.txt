{
  "purpose": "The code defines type-annotated paginator classes for the boto3 workspaces client, serving as SDK stubs to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs, which are passed directly into the underlying boto3 paginator's paginate function.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into the boto3 paginator via **kwargs; no external data is processed or transmitted by this code.",
  "flows": "Input via **kwargs flows into the boto3 paginator's paginate method, with no additional processing or external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward class and method definitions with documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions extending boto3's Paginator with type annotations for various WorkSpaces API calls. It includes conditional imports for Python version compatibility and uses standard patterns for SDK stub generation. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of **kwargs is typical for such wrappers, and the code does not perform any network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3's AWS WorkSpaces client. It serves as a safe SDK stub with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
