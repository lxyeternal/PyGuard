{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the AWS WorkSpaces service client using boto3-stubs, providing type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; type annotations in class methods; conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code mainly defines class structures and type annotations without executing or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code sets up class hierarchies and method signatures; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is standard for boto3-stubs paginator type definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for AWS WorkSpaces service. It includes conditional imports for compatibility, detailed docstrings with links, and type-safe method signatures. No data handling or external data processing is present. The structure is consistent with standard boto3-stubs generated code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks were identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and class extensions for AWS WorkSpaces paginators using boto3-stubs. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected. It is a legitimate, safe code module intended for type-safe SDK usage.",
