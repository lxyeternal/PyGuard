  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Type of code**: All reports confirm that the code is a set of static type definitions (TypedDict, Union, constants, imports) for AWS WorkSpaces SDK API request/response schemas.\n\n2. **Purpose and sources**: The purpose across reports is consistent: defining data structures for SDK static typing, facilitating type safety, and code clarity. Sources include standard library modules, third-party typing extensions, constants, and generated code patterns.\n\n3. **Data flow and sinks**: No runtime data processing, external data handling, or untrusted input processing is evident. The code solely defines data schemas.\n\n4. **Anomalies**: No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears standard for SDK model definitions.\n\n5. **Analysis & conclusion**: All reports agree that the code is benign, purely declarative, with no executable logic or security risks. They note that the code is consistent with SDK code generation, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n\n6. **Confidence & malware risk**: The confidence levels are very high (mostly 0.95 to 1.0), and malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent or code.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Code presence**: Confirmed as static type definitions for AWS SDK.\n- **Malicious indicators**: None detected; no runtime logic, no external data processing, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk**: Effectively zero.\n- **Obfuscation**: None.\n- **Malware**: None.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS WorkSpaces SDK.\n- No security issues, malware, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code is safe, static, and intended solely for type safety.\n\n**My estimated scores**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion**: This code is a benign, standard set of type definitions with no security concerns.",
