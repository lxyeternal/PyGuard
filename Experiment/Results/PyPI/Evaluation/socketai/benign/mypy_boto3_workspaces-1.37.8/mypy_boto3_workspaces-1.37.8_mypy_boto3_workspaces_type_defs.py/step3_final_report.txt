  "purpose": "Static type definitions for AWS WorkSpaces SDK data schemas, facilitating type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, constants, conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "None; purely data structure definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDicts, Union types, constants, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It contains no executable logic, external data processing, or network interactions. The structure aligns with standard SDK model definitions, with no suspicious patterns or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS SDK interactions, with no malicious or security concerns.",
