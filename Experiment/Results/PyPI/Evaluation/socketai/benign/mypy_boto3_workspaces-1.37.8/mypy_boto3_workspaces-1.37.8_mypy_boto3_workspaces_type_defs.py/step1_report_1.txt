  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Workspaces service API requests and responses, used for static type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, import statements, constants, and type alias assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or perform insecure operations; primarily data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows are within type definitions, with no runtime data processing or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code consists solely of type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code provides comprehensive TypedDict definitions for API request and response payloads, using standard Python typing and conditional imports for compatibility. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data leakage, or malicious logic. The use of type annotations aligns with static type checking tools and does not introduce runtime security issues. No external calls, data handling, or processing of untrusted data is present in this snippet. It appears to be a safe, static type definitions module for API schema validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of static type definitions for a Python SDK related to AWS Workspaces. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions that could be malicious. The code is consistent with secure, non-malicious intent, focusing solely on type safety and code clarity.",
