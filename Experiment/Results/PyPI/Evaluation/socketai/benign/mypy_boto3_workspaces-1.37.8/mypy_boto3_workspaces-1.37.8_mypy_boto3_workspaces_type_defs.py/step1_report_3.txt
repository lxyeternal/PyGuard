{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for boto3 workspaces service, facilitating API interactions and data handling.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, and data structure definitions. Data sources include standard library modules, third-party dependencies (botocore, typing_extensions), and internal literals.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code mainly defines data types. No functions or code execution points are present that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; only data structure definitions without logic or data flow handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns. Usage of standard type hints and data structures consistent with AWS SDK code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict and Union definitions used for type hinting in a Python SDK for AWS Workspaces. It imports standard and third-party modules for type annotations, defines numerous data structures with clear fields, and utilizes conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No executable logic, external data handling, or code injection mechanisms are present. The code is consistent with SDK code generation for typed API models, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious set of type definitions for AWS SDK interactions with Workspaces. There are no indicators of malware, security risks, or suspicious anomalies.",
