  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a comprehensive set of static type definitions for AWS WorkSpaces SDK, primarily using TypedDict, Union, and constants.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The purpose is solely to facilitate static type checking and API schema validation.\n\n**Confirmation of issues:**\n- The code does not contain executable logic, data handling, or untrusted input processing.\n- The type definitions appear correct and consistent with standard SDK practices.\n- No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- None identified. The code is purely declarative, and the type annotations are standard and well-structured.\n- Conditional imports for Python version compatibility are correctly implemented.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n\n**Scores and justification:**\n- Malware score: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated score: All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- Risk score: All reports assign 0.0 or very low, which is justified since there's no runtime or security-sensitive operation.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is not handling untrusted data or performing any risky operations.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent with the code's static nature.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a safe, standard set of type definitions for AWS SDK interactions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure elements are present.\n- The high confidence levels (0.95 to 1.0) across reports reinforce this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis code is purely static type annotations with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and intended for static type checking.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a risk score of 0.0.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No action needed; this is a benign, well-structured type definitions module.",
