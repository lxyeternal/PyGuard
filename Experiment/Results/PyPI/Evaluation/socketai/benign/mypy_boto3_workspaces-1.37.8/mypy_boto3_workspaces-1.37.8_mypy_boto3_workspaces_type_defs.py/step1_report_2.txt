{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for the AWS WorkSpaces SDK in Python, enabling type-safe API interactions and data handling.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for class definitions, TypedDicts, Union types, and constants imported from various modules; code also reads data from type annotations and constants.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly designed as sinks for untrusted data; primarily data structure definitions, not runtime data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; the code only defines data types, not execution logic or data processing pipelines.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code strictly defines type structures and constants with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS WorkSpaces API responses and requests using Python's typing system, including TypedDict, Union, and constants. It imports necessary modules and conditionally uses typing extensions based on Python version. The structure aims to facilitate type-safe SDK usage. There are no runtime data manipulations, no code execution, and no external data processing within this script. All components are standard for defining structured data types, with no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This module is solely for defining type annotations for AWS SDK interactions. There are no malicious behaviors, sabotage, or security risks present. It is a safe and standard component of SDK type definitions.",
