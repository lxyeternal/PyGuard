  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Workspaces service API requests and responses, providing structured data models for SDK and code generation.",
  "sources": "All class and type definition declarations, including import statements, class inheritance, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No execution sinks, command execution, network calls, or data manipulation that could lead to malicious behavior are present.",
  "flows": "The code is purely declarative, defining data structures without any data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns, are present. No dynamic code execution, eval, exec, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version. It adheres to standard type hinting practices for API data models. No runtime logic, input handling, or untrusted data processing is included. The code appears to be generated or written for SDK type safety, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving as a set of structured type definitions for AWS SDK data models. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe for use and does not pose any security threat.",
