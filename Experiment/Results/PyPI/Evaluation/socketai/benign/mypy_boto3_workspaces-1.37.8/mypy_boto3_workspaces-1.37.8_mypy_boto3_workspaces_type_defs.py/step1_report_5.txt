  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS WorkSpaces service, defining data structures for API requests and responses.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads data from input parameters, constants, and type annotations; no external or untrusted input sources are directly used.",
  "sinks": "Data is structured into dictionaries and lists; no execution or data leakage points are evident. No external data flows or command execution are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines types and data structures for static typing purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code consists solely of TypedDict definitions and type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict class definitions for AWS SDK models, used for static type checking. It imports necessary modules, defines type aliases, and specifies data structures with no runtime logic, external input handling, or executable code. There are no signs of code injection, malicious behaviors, or sabotage. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or command executions. The type annotations and data structures are standard for SDK definitions and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of type definitions for AWS WorkSpaces SDK and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as static type annotations to aid in development and type checking. Therefore, it poses no threat or malicious activity.",
