{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS SDK enumerations and constants to support type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string literals for type annotations; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing of untrusted data are present; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspect is the extensive list of string literals representing AWS service enumerations, but this is standard for type safety. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The conditional import of 'Literal' is normal for compatibility, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' depending on Python version. It defines numerous constant type aliases for AWS SDK enumerations using 'Literal'. There are no dynamic code executions, external inputs, or data leaks. No signs of malicious logic, such as network activity, file modifications, or secret handling. The initial comment block provides documentation and usage examples, consistent with standard type definition files. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, safe type definition file intended for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of type alias definitions for AWS SDK string literals. It is purely declarative, with no malicious behavior, no data handling, and no external interactions. It is likely a component of a larger SDK or type stubs. No security issues or malware signs are detected.",
