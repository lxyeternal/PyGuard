  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various enumerations used in the AWS boto3 workspaces service for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing/extensions for conditional type annotations; definitions of string literal types for AWS resource and service enumerations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code solely defines type aliases for use elsewhere and does not process untrusted input or produce output.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is declarative type definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The copyright notice and documentation link are benign.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a standard pattern for type annotations compatibility. It then defines numerous string literal types representing enums for AWS services, resources, regions, and other parameters. There are no dynamic executions, no data handling, and no code that interacts with external inputs or outputs. The code is purely for static type hinting and documentation support, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign set of type alias definitions for AWS boto3 service enumerations. It serves as documentation and type safety aid without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
