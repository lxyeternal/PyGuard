{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS service configurations and enums to support type annotations in boto3-stubs for better code correctness and IDE assistance.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals assigned to variables, imports of type annotations, and version check for conditional import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data sources are present; the code is purely static.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to any sinks, as this is a set of static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed. The code is standard for defining type aliases with Literal.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports to maintain compatibility with different Python versions, which is standard practice. All variables are assigned static string literals for type annotations. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or runtime logic exists. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The entire module serves as a static type hinting aid, with no operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward static type definitions module for AWS SDKs, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or external file operations. It appears to be a benign part of a type stubs package for static analysis and IDE support.",
