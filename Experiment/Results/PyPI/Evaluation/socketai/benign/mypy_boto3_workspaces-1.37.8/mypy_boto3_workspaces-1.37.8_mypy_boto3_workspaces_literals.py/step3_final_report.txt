  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS SDK enumerations and configurations using Python's Literal type, supporting type checking and IDE features.",
  "sources": "Defines string literals for various AWS services, resource types, and configurations as static constants; no external data sources or runtime data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; purely static definitions without dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for static type annotations with conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static type alias definitions using Literal, with a version check for Python compatibility. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or obfuscation. The purpose is to provide type safety and documentation support for AWS SDKs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions intended for static analysis, IDE support, and documentation. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
