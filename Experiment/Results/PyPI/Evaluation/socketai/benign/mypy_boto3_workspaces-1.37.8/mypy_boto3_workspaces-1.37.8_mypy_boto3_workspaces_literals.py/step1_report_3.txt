{
  "purpose": "Defines type annotations for various string literal types used in the boto3 workspaces service, facilitating type checking and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and conditionally imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user inputs, or data leaks are present. No sinks that could lead to malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code only defines constants; there are no data flows or data processing operations that could be exploited.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be standard type alias definitions without any unusual or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script provides type annotations for numerous string literal types used in boto3 for AWS Workspaces and related services. It includes a conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a common compatibility pattern. The code is solely for type hinting and documentation purposes, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or data manipulation. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It strictly adheres to standard practices for type alias definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, non-malicious type alias module used for static type checking. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, and no obfuscated code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
