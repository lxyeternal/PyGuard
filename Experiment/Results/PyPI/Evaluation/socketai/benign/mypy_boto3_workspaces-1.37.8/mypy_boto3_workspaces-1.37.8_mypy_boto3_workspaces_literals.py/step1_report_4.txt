  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS SDK service enumerations and constants, used for type annotations in boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "The code imports sys for version checking, and defines multiple Literal types assigned to specific string values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present; the code solely defines constants and types.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sinks; the code is static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code only provides type literals and version-dependent imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type alias definitions for string literals, conditioned on Python version to import Literal appropriately. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or file operations are present. The purpose is purely to provide type annotations for AWS SDK service constants, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purely static set of type definitions intended for type hinting in SDK stub files. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks.",
