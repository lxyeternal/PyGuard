  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward version declaration: a docstring, a copyright comment, and a static assignment to `__version__`.\n- There are no external inputs, outputs, or data flows.\n- No obfuscation, code execution, or dynamic behavior.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk is also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is benign, no malicious intent, straightforward.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n- Malware score: 0, appropriate.\n- No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, notes the future copyright year but considers it benign.\n- Confidence is high (1).\n- Malware score: 0.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: simple version assignment, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same analysis, straightforward, no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), noting the future year as a minor anomaly.\n- Still concludes benign.\n- Malware: 0.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- **Risk scores:** All are appropriately low (0), matching the benign nature.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not malicious but worth noting.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed; the analysis aligns with the code content.\n- The future copyright year could be flagged as a minor issue, but it doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate; the code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
