  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "The line assigning __version__ = \"1.37.8\".",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A — straightforward assignment without external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, copyright notice, and a version assignment. The version string is hardcoded and static, which is typical for such files. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. No external inputs, outputs, or data flows are involved. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as a version indicator.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard versioning snippet commonly used in Python projects.",
