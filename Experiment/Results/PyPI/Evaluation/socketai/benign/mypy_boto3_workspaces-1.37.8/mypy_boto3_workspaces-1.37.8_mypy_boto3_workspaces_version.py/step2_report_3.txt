  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward version assignment with no external data input, no code execution, and no malicious constructs.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this is not inherently malicious.\n- No reports mention any obfuscation, suspicious code, or signs of malware.\n\n**Issue presence confirmation:**\n- The actual code snippet provided is just a single assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.8\"` with a docstring comment. There are no other code elements, no dynamic behavior, no external data sources, and no obfuscation.\n- Therefore, all reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a simple version string declaration.\n- The only minor point is the mention of the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it does not constitute a security risk or malicious activity.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The securityRisk scores are also 0, which is correct.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1, with one at 0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n**Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports suggest any malicious or risky behavior. The code is static, simple, and standard.\n- Therefore, the risk scores should remain at 0 or very close to it.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n**Score consistency:**\n- The scores align well with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — The code is trivial and benign.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risk or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is not malicious but might warrant a comment or correction for clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary. The code poses no security threat.",
