  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the underlying code to ensure consistency, accuracy, and appropriate risk assessment.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe code is a minimal Python snippet:\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.8\"\n```\nIt contains a docstring, a copyright comment with a future year, and a static assignment to `__version__`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is straightforward; no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **External data/input processing:** None.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Straightforward version declaration, no anomalies, no data flow, benign.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, `securityRisk=0`.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, notes the future copyright year.\n- **Scores:** All zero, same as above.\n- **Assessment:** No problem; the future date is likely a typo or intentional but not malicious.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Standard version assignment, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar, straightforward version declaration, no issues.\n- **Scores:** All zero.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others, notes the future year as a potential anomaly.\n- **Scores:** `confidence=0.9`, `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`.\n- **Assessment:** The slightly lower confidence might be due to the future year comment, but since no malicious activity is detected, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** Correctly 0; no vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The future copyright year, while unusual, does not impact security.\n- No changes needed to scores; they are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a minimal, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scoring. No adjustments are necessary.",
