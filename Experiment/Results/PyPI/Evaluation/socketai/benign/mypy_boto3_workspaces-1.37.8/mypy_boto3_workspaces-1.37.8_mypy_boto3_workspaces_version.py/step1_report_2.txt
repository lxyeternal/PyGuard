  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string value to __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; no unusual code structures or hidden behavior. The only unusual aspect is the comment mentioning the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, which is typical for Python package versioning. The comment indicates copyright in 2025, which is a future date, possibly a typo or intentional. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for package version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign version assignment with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The future copyright year is unusual but not malicious.",
