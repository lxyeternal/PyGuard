  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package, serving as a source of truth for the package's versioning information.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it contains a static string assignment and a docstring comment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static string to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future; this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple version string assignment with an accompanying docstring and a copyright comment. No external data input, code execution, or dynamic behavior is present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packages. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not pose a security risk. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0. Confidence in benignity is high, and no suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor issue is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern but may be corrected for accuracy. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
