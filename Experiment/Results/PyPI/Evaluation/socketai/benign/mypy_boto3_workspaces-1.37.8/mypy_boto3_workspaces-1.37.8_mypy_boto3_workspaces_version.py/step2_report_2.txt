  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward version assignment with no external input, data processing, or malicious constructs.\n- The only notable anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this is not inherently malicious.\n- No reports mention any obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The actual code is just a docstring and a single assignment: `__version__ = \"1.37.8\"`.\n- No code execution, data flow, or external input/output is present.\n- The code is benign and typical for Python package versioning.\n\n### Error, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the code itself.\n- The only potential point of concern is the future copyright year (2025), which could be a typo or an oversight but not malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benignity.\n- Report 5 has a slightly lower confidence (0.9), which is acceptable given the future date comment.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- Since the code is static, simple, and contains no external input or suspicious behavior, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- Malware score is correctly at **0**; no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated score is correctly **0**; no obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk is **0**, as there are no vulnerabilities or malicious constructs.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025). This is likely a typo or a placeholder but not malicious.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis confirms benign behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard version declaration.\n- All scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, straightforward, and presents no security concerns. The only minor note is the future copyright year, which could be corrected but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep all scores at zero; no further action needed.",
