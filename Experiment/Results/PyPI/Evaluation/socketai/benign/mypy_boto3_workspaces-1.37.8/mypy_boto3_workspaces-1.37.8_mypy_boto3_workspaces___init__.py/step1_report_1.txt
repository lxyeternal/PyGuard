  "purpose": "This code serves as a main interface module for a 'workspaces' service, providing imports, type aliasing, and exports for various paginator classes and a client class related to AWS WorkSpaces.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator) and string literals containing documentation.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive sinks such as network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily within the module's imports and exports, with no external data flows or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and appears to be a typical SDK wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, a type alias, and an __all__ declaration for module exports. It includes a documentation string with usage examples. No code executes untrusted data, performs network operations, or manipulates sensitive data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The module appears to be a clean, well-structured interface layer.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign interface for AWS WorkSpaces SDK components, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It mainly organizes imports and exports for user convenience.",
