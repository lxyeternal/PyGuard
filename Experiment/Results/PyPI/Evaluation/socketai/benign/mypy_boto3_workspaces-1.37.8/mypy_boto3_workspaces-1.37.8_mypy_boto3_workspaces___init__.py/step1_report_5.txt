{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for the AWS WorkSpaces service, including importing necessary components and defining exports for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), no external data inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; no data leakage, injection, or malicious activity observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; primarily module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a straightforward API interface wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules, defines a client alias, and exports them via __all__. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or any data processing that could be malicious. It follows standard Python module patterns for API wrapper modules. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for interfacing with AWS WorkSpaces, containing no malicious or suspicious activity. It is a clean, well-structured interface definition with no security concerns.",
