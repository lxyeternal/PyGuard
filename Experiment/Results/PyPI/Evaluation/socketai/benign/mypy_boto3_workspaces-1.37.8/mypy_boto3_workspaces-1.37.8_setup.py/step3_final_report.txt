  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-workspaces Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md for long description; static package metadata and dependencies defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Static data from local files and hardcoded parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup script that reads a local README file and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The package dependencies and URLs are explicitly defined. All signals indicate benign, well-structured packaging code without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, safe Python package setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports correctly assess the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the code shows no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
