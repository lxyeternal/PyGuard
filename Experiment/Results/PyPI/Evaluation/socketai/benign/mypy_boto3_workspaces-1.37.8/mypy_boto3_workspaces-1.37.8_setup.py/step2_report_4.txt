  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the script as a standard Python package setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation are reported.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, and a security risk of 0.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and follows common packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code content**: The code reads a local README.md file and calls `setup()` with static parameters. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious logic are present.\n- **Behavior**: No untrusted data, no code injection, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware presence**: None detected.\n- **Obfuscation**: None detected.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports or code. All assessments correctly identify the script as benign.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The script is purely static configuration code.\n- No untrusted data handling or code execution.\n- No network activity or malicious patterns.\n- All package data and dependencies are standard and explicitly specified.\n\n### Potential points of contention:\n- None. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The script is a typical, well-structured setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code and reports align perfectly. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or code changes, but based on the current static code and reports, the package setup script is secure and benign.",
