  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Path for file handling, reads a markdown file for long_description, and invokes setup() with static package configuration parameters. All data is static or derived from local files. No user input or untrusted data sources are used. No code execution, network activity, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves solely for packaging purposes and contains no suspicious or malicious code.",
