  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-workspaces', used for package configuration and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setuptools for package setup; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network or file operations beyond standard package setup.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file (source) and passing metadata to setup() (sink). No untrusted data flows or external command executions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No external inputs or outputs are manipulated beyond package configuration. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
