  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is consistent; the code is straightforward.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which seems appropriate given the code's static and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code is static, reads only a local README.md file, and calls `setup()` with fixed parameters.\n- No signs of code injection, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior.\n- The dependencies are standard, with a conditional requirement based on Python version, which is common practice.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reasoning in all reports correctly identifies the code as benign and standard.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0, correct.\n- Security risk: 0, justified.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- No issues are detected or suspected.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a typical, safe setup script with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence.",
