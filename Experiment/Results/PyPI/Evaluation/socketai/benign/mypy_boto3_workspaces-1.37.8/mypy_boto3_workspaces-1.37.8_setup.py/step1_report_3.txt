{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute the 'mypy-boto3-workspaces' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description, and defines static package metadata and dependencies within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling that could be exploited or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script mainly sets static configuration and reads a local file for description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard Python packaging practices with no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and third-party modules to facilitate package setup. It reads a local README file for long description, which is safe. The setup() function defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All data appears static and configuration-oriented. There are no sources of untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, and no network or system modifications. The dependencies are standard and explicitly specified. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It strictly performs configuration for packaging and distribution purposes.",
