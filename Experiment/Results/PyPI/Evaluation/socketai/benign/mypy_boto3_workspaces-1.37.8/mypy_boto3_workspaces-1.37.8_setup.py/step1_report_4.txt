{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the packaging configuration for the mypy-boto3-workspaces Python package, defining its metadata, dependencies, and distribution details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and static string values for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data is transmitted or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script is static configuration code without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code adheres to standard setup script conventions without hidden or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads static files, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no untrusted input handling, nor network activity or credential handling. All code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs standard package configuration tasks.",
