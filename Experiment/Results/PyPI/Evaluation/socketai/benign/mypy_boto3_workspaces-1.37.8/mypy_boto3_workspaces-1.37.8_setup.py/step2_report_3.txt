  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims and scores, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description.\n- The setup() call contains static package metadata, dependencies, and URLs.\n- No untrusted data, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Flow and sinks:** No untrusted data flows or sinks are involved.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; the code follows typical packaging practices.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is clear and static.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** All claims are accurate; no assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, code is clear.\n- **Security risk score (0):** Correct, no vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed reviews, the code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores are justified.",
