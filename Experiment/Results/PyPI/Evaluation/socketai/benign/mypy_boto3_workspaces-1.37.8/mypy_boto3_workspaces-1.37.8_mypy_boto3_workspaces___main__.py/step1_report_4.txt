  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (for command-line arguments), sys.stdout (for output), imported sys module.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (for output), no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument in sys.argv → conditional check → output via sys.stdout.write.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. Code performs straightforward info printing.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes these based on command-line arguments. No input validation or external data fetching is performed. No suspicious or malicious code is present. The code only outputs static text when invoked, with no network activity or data processing beyond printing static strings. No obfuscated code or obfuscation techniques are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious flows, and no security risks. It is a benign, straightforward script.",
