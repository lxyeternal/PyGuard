  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation**:  \n   The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking, nor does it perform any external network or file operations. The code matches the description in all reports.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external data sources.\n   - No network activity, file manipulation, or other malicious behavior.\n   - The code's logic is straightforward and safe.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The code is minimal and performs only static output, which is appropriate for its purpose.\n\n4. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   - No issues justify higher risk scores; the code is purely informational with no malicious intent.\n   - The scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n6. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores**:  \n   - Both are correctly assigned as 0, reflecting the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - All reports are based on straightforward analysis, with no assumptions about hidden malicious behavior.\n   - The code is transparent and simple, reducing the likelihood of missed malicious intent.\n\n8. **Score Consistency**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports' scores are accurate and justified.\n\n**Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scoring as it accurately reflects the code's benign nature. No further action is necessary.",
