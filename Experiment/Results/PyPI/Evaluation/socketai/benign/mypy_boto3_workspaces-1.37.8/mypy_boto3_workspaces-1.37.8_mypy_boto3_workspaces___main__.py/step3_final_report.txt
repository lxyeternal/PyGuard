  "purpose": "A simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs static strings to sys.stdout; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check leads to printing version or info strings; no external data flow or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI script that prints predefined static information. It only reads command-line arguments and writes to stdout, with no external dependencies, dynamic data handling, or code execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as 0. The code does not process untrusted input in a risky way, nor does it perform any malicious actions. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No issues or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
