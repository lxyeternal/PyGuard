  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) -> Conditional branch -> Output to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious file operations, no network communications, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no unusual variables or logic",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that prints package info or version based on command-line arguments. It uses standard library functions and no external data inputs beyond command-line args. There are no suspicious data flows, no hardcoded secrets, and no potentially malicious code actions such as network access, file manipulation, or code execution. The code's simplicity indicates it performs a benign function for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information or version details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe for use.",
