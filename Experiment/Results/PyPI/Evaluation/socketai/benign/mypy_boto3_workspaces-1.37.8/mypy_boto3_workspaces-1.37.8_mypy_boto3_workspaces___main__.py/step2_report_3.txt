  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.\n   - It only reads from `sys.argv` and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n   - There are no dynamic data inputs, external network calls, file manipulations, or code execution.\n   - All strings are hardcoded, and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Issues or Anomalies**:\n   - The code is straightforward, with no anomalies, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior.\n   - No dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - **Malware score:** 0.0\n     - **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n     - **Security risk score:** 0.0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n4. **Risk Justification**:\n   - Since the code performs only static output based on command-line arguments without any external dependencies or dynamic behavior, the risk score should remain at **0.0**.\n   - No reason exists to elevate the risk score because there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the script is benign.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely informational.\n\n6. **Scores Consistency & Recommendations**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a simple, safe CLI utility.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports correctly identify that this is a benign, straightforward script with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
