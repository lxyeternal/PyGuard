{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point that provides package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 WorkSpaces.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data; no other sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) triggers the flow; '--version' argument leads to printing version info; otherwise, prints package info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements detected. The code performs straightforward I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version info, and includes a main function that checks for a '--version' argument to decide what to print. There are no external data sources, no untrusted inputs affecting sensitive operations, and no use of third-party libraries or network calls. The logic is simple, direct, and secure. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard CLI utility that outputs package metadata based on command-line arguments. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use and appears to be a legitimate component of a package.",
