  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a Python package that outputs package info or version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv (argument '--version') flows to function call to print_version; otherwise, flows to print_info output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and primarily outputs static package information. It only reads command-line arguments and writes static text to stdout. No untrusted input processing or data leaks are present. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions as a simple CLI utility displaying package info or version. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
