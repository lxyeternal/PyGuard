  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 WorkSpaces and related documentation.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs info to stdout)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs static information), no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version; otherwise, print_info is called, both output static data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded strings are informational and static; no dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The script performs simple command-line argument checking and prints static package info or version. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond command-line args, and outputs are fixed strings. No data leaks, external calls, or malicious behavior are present. No obfuscation or complex logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
