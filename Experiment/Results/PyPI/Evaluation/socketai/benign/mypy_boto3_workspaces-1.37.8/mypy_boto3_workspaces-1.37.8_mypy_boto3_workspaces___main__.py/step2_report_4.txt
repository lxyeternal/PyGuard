  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It prints static package information or version based on command-line argument '--version'.\n- Uses only standard library functions (`sys.argv`, `sys.stdout.write`).\n- No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is straightforward, static, and benign. No issues are detected in the code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports consistently identify the code as benign, with no flaws or logical errors. Their reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- The code is purely informational, with no malicious behavior.  \n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.  \n- **Score should remain 0.**\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- The code is clear, with no obfuscation techniques.  \n- **Score should remain 0.**\n\n**Security Risk Score:**  \n- The code does not handle untrusted input in a dangerous way, nor does it perform any risky operations.  \n- It is a static informational script.  \n- **Score should remain 0.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward.  \n- No external dependencies or dynamic behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the script is a simple, safe CLI utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, static, and straightforward.\n- No modifications needed to the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0. The code poses no security threat.",
