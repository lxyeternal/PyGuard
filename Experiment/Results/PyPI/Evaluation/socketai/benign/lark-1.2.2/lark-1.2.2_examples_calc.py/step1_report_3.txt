{
  "purpose": "A simple REPL calculator supporting variables, expressions, and basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input is read from the user via the input() function; variables are stored in the self.vars dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The parsed expression is evaluated directly, and the results are printed to the console. No external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User input -> parsing via Lark -> transformation and evaluation in CalculateTree -> output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. Usage of eval-like parsing is controlled through the grammar. The code contains a try-except for Python 2 compatibility, which is benign. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic calculator with variable support using the Lark parsing library. It reads input from the user, parses the expression according to a defined grammar, evaluates it, and outputs the result. The CalculateTree transformer manages variable assignment and expression evaluation, storing variables in an internal dictionary. There are no external data transfers, no use of system calls beyond console input/output, and no dynamic code execution beyond parsing the provided expressions. The code appears straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic calculator implementation with variable support, and it does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a local expression evaluator without external interactions or data exfiltration.",
