  "purpose": "A simple REPL calculator supporting variables and arithmetic operations, parsing user input with 'lark' and evaluating expressions.",
  "sources": "User input read via 'input()' function.",
  "sinks": "Evaluation of parsed expressions; no external data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "User input -> parser ('lark') -> transformer -> variable storage or calculation result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic calculator with variable support, parsing input expressions with 'lark' and evaluating them via a transformer. It reads user input directly and evaluates it within a controlled grammar, limiting scope to arithmetic and variable assignment. No external network activity, file operations, or code injection is present. The parser and transformer are designed for safe arithmetic evaluation, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The inherent risk of evaluating user input is minimal here due to the restricted grammar and safe evaluation approach.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe calculator implementation with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The risk associated with user input evaluation is low and well-managed. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
