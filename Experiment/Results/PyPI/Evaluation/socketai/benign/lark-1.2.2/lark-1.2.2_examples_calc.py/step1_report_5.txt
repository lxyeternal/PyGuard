  "purpose": "A simple REPL calculator supporting variables and basic arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Input from user via 'input()' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' function outputs calculation results; 'calc' function processes user input.",
  "flows": "User input flows from 'input()' to 'calc' parser, which processes and evaluates expressions, then outputs via 'print'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Use of 'eval'-like parsing is safe here as it is controlled with 'lark'. No code injection or external data flows identified. Variable storage is in-memory only. The code handles variable assignment and calculations securely without unsafe evaluations.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a basic calculator with variable support using the 'lark' parsing library. It reads user input from the console, parses expressions, evaluates them, and displays the results. No external data sources or network communications are present. The use of 'lark' is appropriate and does not introduce obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code manages variables securely within its scope. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code snippets. The code appears to be a straightforward calculator implementation intended for educational or simple calculation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign calculator application with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It securely handles variable storage internally and processes user inputs without external data leaks or network activities. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
