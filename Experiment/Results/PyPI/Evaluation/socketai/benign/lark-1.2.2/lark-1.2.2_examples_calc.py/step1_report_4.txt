  "purpose": "A basic REPL calculator supporting variables, operations, and expression evaluation.",
  "sources": "User input via 'input' function, especially the variable 's' in main() and test() functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'calc(s)', which parses and evaluates user-provided expressions. No direct data leaks or unsafe sinks observed.",
  "flows": "User input -> calc(s) -> parsing and evaluation -> possible variable lookup or calculation results.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'raw_input' for Python 2 compatibility, which is standard. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a calculator using the 'lark' parsing library. It includes variable assignment, expression parsing, and evaluation. Input is received from the user and then parsed and evaluated. The variables are stored internally in a dictionary. No external network calls, file I/O, or system modifications are present. The use of 'try-except' for Python 2 compatibility is benign. The parsing and evaluation logic are standard and do not include any malicious code or backdoors. No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior are evident. The code performs only computational tasks with safe Python features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward calculator implementation with variable support. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
