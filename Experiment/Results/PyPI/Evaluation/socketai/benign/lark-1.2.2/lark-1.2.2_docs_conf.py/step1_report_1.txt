  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no external data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration variables are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. All code is standard Sphinx configuration with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx configuration file with standard imports, path adjustments, and documentation settings. No code reads untrusted input, no external connections, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated logic. It strictly defines documentation build parameters. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration file for generating project documentation. It does not contain malware or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
