  "purpose": "Implement a LOGO-like turtle graphics language interpreter using Python and the 'lark' parser.",
  "sources": "User input via 'input' function, 'program' parameter in 'run_turtle' function, and 'test' function's string data.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'turtle' module functions such as 'color', 'fd', 'bk', 'lt', 'rt', 'begin_fill', 'end_fill'.",
  "flows": "User input or test string -> parser -> 'run_instruction' functions -> 'turtle' graphics functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of 'turtle' functions is standard for graphics.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple grammar for a turtle graphics language, parsing commands and executing them via Python's turtle module. The input is obtained from user input or test string, then parsed and executed. The code uses dynamic lookup for movement commands but only calls trusted 'turtle' functions. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or suspicious patterns identified. The code is straightforward and intended for graphical output only.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign implementation of a turtle graphics interpreter with no apparent malicious or security-threatening behavior. It solely interacts with the 'turtle' graphics module based on user or test input, with no external data or network operations.",
