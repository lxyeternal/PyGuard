{
  "purpose": "Implement a LOGO-like turtle graphics interpreter that parses and executes drawing commands from user input or predefined scripts.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via the 'input' function; hardcoded test string in 'test()' function.",
  "writers": "Direct calls to the turtle module functions such as turtle.color(), turtle.fd(), turtle.bk(), turtle.lt(), turtle.rt(), turtle.begin_fill(), turtle.end_fill()",
  "flows": "User input or test string → parser.parse() → run_instruction() → specific turtle commands",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. No code injection or malicious system calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a simple DSL for turtle graphics, parsing commands via Lark grammar. It processes movement, color changes, fill blocks, and repeats. The input is solely user-provided or predefined strings, with commands executed through the turtle module. No network activity, file system access, or external data leaks are present. No obfuscated code or hidden payloads. The code operates within the safe bounds of the turtle graphics library, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign educational tool for turtle graphics scripting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present in the code. It relies on standard libraries and user input, with no dangerous external interactions.",
