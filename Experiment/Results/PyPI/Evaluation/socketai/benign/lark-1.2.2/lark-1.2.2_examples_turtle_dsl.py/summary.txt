  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, educational turtle graphics interpreter with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and security risk scores are justified. The primary concern is unvalidated user input leading to unwanted drawings, not security threats. No modifications are necessary; the code can be safely used with minor input validation if desired."
