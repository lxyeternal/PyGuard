The primary concern is unvalidated user input leading to unwanted drawings, not security threats. No modifications are necessary; the code can be safely used with minor input validation if desired."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying a moderate suspicion level. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 5 from 0.3 to around 0.4 is recommended to better reflect the suspicious techniques observed. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided descriptions."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard AST manipulation framework with no embedded malicious behavior. The main risk stems from external untrusted user code, not from the code itself. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.2) reflects the potential for misuse if untrusted functions are used, but this is a known and acceptable aspect of such systems."

The only potential risk is assertion-triggered denial-of-service, which is not considered a security vulnerability. Overall, the code is benign and appropriate for its purpose."
