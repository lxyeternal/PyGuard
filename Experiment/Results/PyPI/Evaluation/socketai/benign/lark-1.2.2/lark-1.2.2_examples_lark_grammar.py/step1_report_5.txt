{
  "purpose": "The code loads and parses multiple Lark grammar files using the Lark parsing library, primarily for testing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads contents of grammar files from the filesystem using open() within the test() function.",
  "sinks": "Uses parser.parse() on data read from files; no untrusted input is explicitly processed, but file contents are parsed directly.",
  "flows": "File contents are read by open() and passed directly to parser.parse() without sanitization or validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes paths relative to the script and lark library, then opens each grammar file, parsing its contents with the Lark parser. It performs straightforward file reading and parsing with no data manipulation, sanitization, or external network activity. The approach is typical for grammar validation. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code identified. The only potential concern is parsing files directly without validation, but given the context, this appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple loader and parser for grammar files, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
