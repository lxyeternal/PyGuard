{
  "purpose": "This script loads and parses multiple Lark grammar files using the Lark parser library, primarily for testing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading the content of each grammar file with open(grammar_file).read() within the test() function.",
  "sinks": "Parsing data passed directly to parser.parse(), which processes the content of grammar files. No untrusted external input beyond file contents is involved.",
  "flows": "Source: open() reading grammar file contents -> sink: parser.parse() processing the data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() to read files directly without validation, but this is standard for parsing files. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code loads multiple grammar files from specific directories relative to the script's location. It opens each file, reads its content, and parses it using the Lark parser. The code relies on local files and the external lark library. There are no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of obfuscation. The open() calls are straightforward file reads; the parser operates on trusted file contents. Overall, the script appears to be a utility for parsing grammar definitions, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for parsing local grammar files using the Lark library. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks present. It appears to be a legitimate, benign script intended for grammar validation.",
