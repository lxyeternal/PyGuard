{
  "purpose": "The code loads and parses multiple Lark grammar files using the Lark parsing library.",
  "sources": "Reads grammar files from disk using open() and read() methods.",
  "sinks": "None that lead to data leakage or malicious actions; only file reading and parsing.",
  "flows": "Reads grammar files from disk -> parses content with Lark parser.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without any input validation or sanitization, but since files are local and predefined, this is typical and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, sets file paths, loads the Lark parser, and iterates through a list of predefined grammar files to parse them. The use of open() is straightforward and local; no external user input influences file names or content. No data is sent over the network, nor are there indicators of malicious behavior such as reverse shells, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be a utility for parsing grammars as intended.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard file reading and parsing operation of local grammar files with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors. It appears to be a benign utility script.",
