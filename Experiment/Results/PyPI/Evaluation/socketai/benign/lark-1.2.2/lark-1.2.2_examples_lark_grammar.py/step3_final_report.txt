{
  "purpose": "The code loads multiple local grammar files and parses them using the Lark parser to validate or process grammar definitions.",
  "sources": "The code reads files via open() calls on predefined file paths, specifically in the 'grammar_files' list.",
  "sinks": "The code passes the contents of these files directly to parser.parse(), which could be a sink if files are untrusted, but in this context, they are predefined and controlled.",
  "flows": "File contents are read from disk and directly fed into parser.parse() without validation, representing a straightforward source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted user input.",
  "analysis": "The script loads multiple local grammar files and parses them with the Lark library. It performs simple file reading operations without validation or external communication. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose appears to be utility-based, for validating or testing grammar files. Given the controlled nature of file sources and the absence of malicious indicators, the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this analysis, reflecting minimal inherent risk in reading local files without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign utility for parsing local grammar files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
