{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and utility functions for handling parsing errors in a Python parsing library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.utils, .lexer, .parsers.lalr_interactive_parser, .tree). Uses data from exception instances such as tokens, text, and parser states.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data (tokens, error contexts, parser states) could be exposed through string representations or exception messages.",
  "flows": "Error conditions and exception handling flow, where exception data such as tokens, text context, and parser states are processed and formatted for output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Code primarily defines exception classes with standard behaviors. No external network or file I/O present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various custom exception classes for parsing errors, including UnexpectedInput and its subclasses. These classes handle error reporting, context extraction, and error matching. The implementation appears straightforward and adheres to typical patterns for error handling in parsers. No suspicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The use of exception classes and context formatting is standard practice. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a set of error handling classes for a parser library. It does not include any malicious or sabotage behaviors. It mainly formats and reports errors, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
