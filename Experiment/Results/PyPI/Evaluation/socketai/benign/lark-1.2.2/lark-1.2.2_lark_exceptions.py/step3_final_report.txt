{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes and utility functions for error handling within a parser framework, including context extraction and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Input data includes text, tokens, parser states, and exception parameters used for generating error messages and context.",
  "sinks": "Error messages and context strings are generated internally; no external data flow or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Source data (text, tokens, parser states) flows into error message formatting functions, with no external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions that could be triggered by malicious input, potentially causing denial-of-service, but assertions are for debugging and not security vulnerabilities.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of error classes for a parser, handling unexpected input, tokens, EOF, and context formatting. It does not perform external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration. The only minor concern is assertions that could be exploited to cause crashes, but this is typical debugging behavior and not a security flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard error handling for a parser library, with no malicious intent or external system interaction. The only potential risk is assertion-triggered denial-of-service, which is not considered a security vulnerability. Overall, the code is benign and appropriate for its purpose.",
