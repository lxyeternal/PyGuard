{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a parsing framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.utils, .lexer, .parsers, .tree), and class/method definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines exception classes and utility methods, with no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The code uses type annotations, exception handling, and text processing in a standard way.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for various parsing errors, including UnexpectedInput, UnexpectedEOF, UnexpectedCharacters, and UnexpectedToken. These classes are used to report errors encountered during lexing and parsing, with methods to generate context strings and match examples. There are no indications of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or other malicious behaviors. The imports are limited to standard or project-specific modules, and no network, file, or system commands are executed. The logic is straightforward, focusing on error reporting and context generation without external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of error classes for a parsing library with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured error handling code with no suspicious behavior.",
