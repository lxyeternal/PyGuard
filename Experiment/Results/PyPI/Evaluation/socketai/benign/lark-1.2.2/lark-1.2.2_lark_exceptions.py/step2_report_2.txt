  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes error classes and utility functions for error handling in a parser framework.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows or sinks; primarily generates error messages.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses assertions that could cause denial of service if triggered maliciously, but assertions are typically for debugging and are not considered security vulnerabilities.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected. The code is diagnostic, not executing untrusted code or performing external actions.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard error handling code.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** 0.0; no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flow or external system interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard error classes, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, typical for parser error handling.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** 0.0; no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes with some data processing for error reporting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Error data (tokens, context) could be exposed via exception messages, but no external system interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no external I/O.\n- **Analysis:** Standard error handling, formatting error messages.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** 0.0; no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, error classes for parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows or sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Typical parser error classes.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard code.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** 0.0; no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, defining error classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external interactions.\n- **Analysis:** Standard error handling code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** 0.0; no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a set of error classes and utility functions for a parser framework.\n- **External Interaction:** No network, file, or system commands are executed.\n- **Data Handling:** Input data is used solely for error message formatting; no untrusted data is processed in a malicious way.\n- **Obfuscation & Malicious Patterns:** None detected. Assertions are used for validation but are not inherently malicious.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is the use of assertions which could be exploited to cause denial of service if an attacker supplies malicious input that triggers assertion failures. However, assertions are generally disabled in production, and their misuse is not considered a security vulnerability per se.\n\n### Final Security Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risks identified, as the code is purely for error reporting and diagnostics.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component appears safe. It is a standard set of error handling classes for a parser library with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only very minor consideration is the use of assertions, which are not security risks but could cause DoS if exploited, though this is generally not classified as a security vulnerability.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
