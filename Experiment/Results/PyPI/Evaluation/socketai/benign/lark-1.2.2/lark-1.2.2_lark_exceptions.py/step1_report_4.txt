{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and helper functions for error handling within a parser or lexer framework, likely part of a larger parsing library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data mainly through exception initializations and class attribute assignments; it does not process untrusted external input directly within this fragment.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is written, sent over the network, or stored insecurely within this code segment.",
  "flows": "The code sets up exception objects with attributes that could be used downstream for error reporting, but it does not execute any untrusted data flow or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. All functions and classes serve standard error handling purposes. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured exception classes for parsing errors, with methods for generating error messages and context. It imports only standard and type hinting modules, with some lazy imports within initializers to avoid circular dependencies. No external input processing, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are observable. The overall structure and logic are consistent with typical parser error handling implementations.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code fragment. It appears to be a benign, standard set of error handling classes for a parsing library.",
