  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's functionality, data flow, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines error classes and utility functions for error handling in a parser framework. It manages syntax, lexer, and runtime errors, providing context and matching errors for diagnostics.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** The code reads input text and tokens to generate error messages but does not send data externally.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No external data flow or suspicious patterns. Assertions could be triggered with malicious input, but assertions are generally for debugging and not security risks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code is standard for error reporting.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0  \n\n**Overall:** Safe, standard error handling code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes for parsing errors with detailed error messages.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external data flow or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard error classes, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0  \n\n**Overall:** Safe, typical for error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes, with potential exposure of sensitive data through error messages.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Error context and token data could be exposed in logs or exceptions.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No external system access, but sensitive data (tokens, context) could leak if exceptions are logged insecurely.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code itself is benign, but it handles data that could be sensitive. If error messages are logged or exposed improperly, there could be a risk of data leakage.\n\n**Security Consideration:**  \nWhile the code does not perform malicious actions, the handling of error context and token data should be carefully managed to avoid unintentional data leaks.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (due to potential data exposure if misused)\n\n**Overall:** Slight concern about data exposure, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, defining exception classes with error context generation.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external system interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard error classes, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0  \n\n**Overall:** Safe, standard error handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines error classes with no external interactions.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** No external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical error classes, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0.0  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0  \n- Risk: 0.0  \n\n**Overall:** Safe, standard for parser error handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily defining error classes and utility functions for error reporting within a parser framework.\n- The only nuanced point is in Report 3, where error messages could expose sensitive data (tokens, context). This is a common concern but not inherently malicious.\n- No code exhibits malicious behavior, backdoors, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The use of assertions could cause denial of service if malicious input triggers assertion failures, but assertions are generally for debugging and not security vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The overall malware scores should remain at **0.0** across all reports.\n- Obfuscation is not present.\n- The risk score in Report 3 could be slightly increased to reflect potential data exposure if error messages are logged insecurely, but this is more a best-practice concern than a security flaw.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 for Report 3 (due to potential data exposure if error messages are mishandled)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is standard error handling code for a parser library. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The only minor concern is the handling of sensitive data in error messages, which should be managed carefully in production environments to prevent leaks.",
