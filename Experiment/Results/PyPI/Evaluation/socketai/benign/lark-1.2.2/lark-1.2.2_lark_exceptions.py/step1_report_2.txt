{
  "purpose": "Define various custom exception classes used for error handling in a parsing library, including syntax, lexical, unexpected input, and internal errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (.utils, typing, and conditional imports for type checking). Class and function definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code mainly defines exception classes and utility methods without executing external commands or handling untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sensitive sinks; the code primarily raises and formats exceptions based on internal parser state and input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code. Exception classes use typical pattern for error reporting. The get_context method manipulates text for error messages but does not process untrusted input in a harmful way.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes to handle parser and lexer errors in a parsing library. These include UnexpectedInput subclasses for various unexpected scenarios and helper methods for error message formatting. The code imports modules and type hints but does not perform any external network or system operations. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be standard for error handling in a parser library, with no suspicious patterns or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a parsing framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured and typical for such libraries, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
