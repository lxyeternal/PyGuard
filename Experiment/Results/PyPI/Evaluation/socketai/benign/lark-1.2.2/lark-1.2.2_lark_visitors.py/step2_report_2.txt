  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes a library for AST transformations and visitors, consistent with the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies dynamic method invocation via getattr, which could be a vector for executing user-supplied code if untrusted functions are provided.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; standard patterns. The code's flexibility via decorators and dynamic method handling could be exploited if user code is malicious, but the code itself does not contain malicious payloads.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, well-reasoned. Malware score 0 is appropriate; the security risk is low (0.2), given the potential for user code to be malicious but no inherent maliciousness in the library itself.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes a framework for AST processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Focuses on user-defined callbacks, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The mention of potential exponential blow-up in ambiguity collapse is a known issue, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate. Malware score 0 is appropriate; the security risk is low.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes that invoking user-defined functions could be a vector if functions are malicious, but this is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The dynamic method invocation is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-justified. Malware score 0, security risk 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same as above; user callbacks could be malicious if untrusted.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The complex but standard patterns are typical in parser frameworks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid. Malware score 0, security risk 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that user-defined callbacks could be malicious, but the code itself is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation; the patterns are typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-justified. Malware score 0, security risk 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious payloads or obfuscated malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting potential misuse if user-supplied code is malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard risk level for a framework that executes user-defined code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code is a standard, flexible AST processing library with no inherent malicious behavior. The main security concern is the potential for malicious user code, which is outside the scope of this static review.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- All reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- The code is safe and legitimate.  \n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
