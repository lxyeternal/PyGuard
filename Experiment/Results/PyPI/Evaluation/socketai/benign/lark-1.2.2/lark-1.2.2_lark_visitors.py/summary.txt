  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard AST manipulation framework with no embedded malicious behavior. The main risk stems from external untrusted user code, not from the code itself. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.2) reflects the potential for misuse if untrusted functions are used, but this is a known and acceptable aspect of such systems."
