{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates parsing indentation using the Lark library with a custom Indenter class for context-sensitive whitespace handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads a string `test_tree` containing indented text, and the Lark parser processes this input to generate a parse tree.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data; the parser processes static strings and standard library functions without writing or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "Input string `test_tree` flows into the parser, which uses the custom `TreeIndenter` for tokenization. The parse tree is then output via `pretty()` method.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are detected. The code uses standard parsing patterns with the Lark library and a straightforward class override.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Lark library and its Indenter class, defines a grammar for parsing indented structures, and customizes the Indenter to recognize specific tokens for indentation. It then parses a static multi-line string with nested indentation, printing the parse tree. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network interactions. The logic is clear and standard for indentation parsing. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example of indentation parsing using the Lark library with a custom Indenter class. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
