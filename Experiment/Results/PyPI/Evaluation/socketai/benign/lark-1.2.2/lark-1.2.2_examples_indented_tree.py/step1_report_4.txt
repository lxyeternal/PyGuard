  "purpose": "Demonstrate parsing of indentation in a whitespace-sensitive language using Lark and a custom Indenter class.",
  "sources": "Import statements (lark and lark.indenter), string definitions (grammar and test data), parser initialization, and test function.",
  "sinks": "The parse method which processes the test_tree string and generates a parse tree.",
  "flows": "Input data (test_tree string) -> parser.parse() -> internal parsing and token handling (indentation and newlines) -> output with pretty() method.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code uses standard Lark parsing utilities and straightforward string data. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a simple indentation-aware grammar using Lark, with a custom Indenter class to manage indentation tokens. The test input is a hardcoded multi-line string with indentation. The parser processes this input to generate and print a parse tree. All code components are standard and relate directly to demonstrating indentation parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of using Lark for indentation-sensitive parsing. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the implementation appears safe and intended solely for demonstration purposes.",
