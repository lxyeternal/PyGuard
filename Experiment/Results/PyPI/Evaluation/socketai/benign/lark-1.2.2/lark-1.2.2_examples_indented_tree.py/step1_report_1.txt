{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate parsing of indentation-based language using Lark and a custom Indenter class.",
  "sources": "The code reads a string 'test_tree' containing indentation-based structured text. It also loads modules 'lark' and 'lark.indenter'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input string 'test_tree' flows into 'parser.parse()'. There are no untrusted data sources or sinks, and no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The code simply sets up and uses the 'lark' library to parse a structured string. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a grammar for parsing indentation-based structures, customizes the Indenter class, and executes parsing on a static test string. It imports standard libraries, sets up the parser with specified grammar and indenter, and prints the parse tree. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or malicious code execution. The modules used are standard open-source parsing libraries, and the code appears to serve a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of indentation parsing using 'lark'. It does not contain malware or security risks. It is safe and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
