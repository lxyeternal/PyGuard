{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates parsing indentation-based syntax using the Lark parser and a custom Indenter class.",
  "sources": "Reads a string input `test_tree` containing indentation-based data; uses Lark's parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not send data over network, write to files, or execute commands.",
  "flows": "Input string `test_tree` flows into the parser, which processes it according to the grammar and indenter logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a grammar for indentation-sensitive parsing, sets up a custom Indenter class, and parses a sample indented string. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a benign demonstration of parsing techniques.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an example of indentation parsing with Lark and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, instructional script.",
