{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates parsing of indentation-sensitive language syntax using the Lark library with a custom Indenter class.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'test_tree' string and the 'parser.parse()' function which processes this input.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data (test_tree string) is processed by the parser, but there are no further sinks such as network, file writes, or external system calls.",
  "flows": "Input string (test_tree) -> parser.parse() -> processing via Lark with custom Indenter",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code mainly involves standard parsing logic with no external data access or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a grammar for indentation-based parsing, defines a custom Indenter class for handling indentation tokens, and parses a sample indentation tree. It uses standard libraries (lark), which are common in parsing tasks. No external data sources, no suspicious function calls, no network activity, and no code that performs malicious actions or data exfiltration. The code’s purpose is educational/demonstrative, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of indentation parsing using Lark. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present in this snippet.",
