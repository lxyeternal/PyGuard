{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates parsing indentation-sensitive language using the Lark library with a custom Indenter class.",
  "sources": "Static string 'test_tree' containing indented text; the grammar matches indentation patterns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static input only, no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input string flows through the parser and Indenter, resulting in a parse tree; no malicious or suspicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign demonstration of indentation parsing. It imports standard modules, defines a simple grammar, and processes static input. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or malicious behavior is present. The custom Indenter class correctly specifies token types and indentation behavior. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the code's safe and educational nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious example of indentation parsing with no security risks or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are consistent with the analysis.",
