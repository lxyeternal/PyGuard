  "purpose": "Demonstration of explicit ambiguity handling using Lark's Earley parser in Python.",
  "sources": "Input data: the string 'fruit flies like bananas' and the parser initialization.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data; no output or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The parser processes the input sentence and generates a parse tree; the tree is used for visualization functions, which are commented out.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; the functions related to tree visualization are inactive, and the parser setup appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a context-free grammar and uses Lark's parser with explicit ambiguity handling. It parses a static input string and prints the parse tree. Visualization functions are defined but commented out, indicating no active visualization or data output. There are no indications of data leakage, external communications, or malicious code execution. The code appears to be a straightforward demonstration of parsing techniques with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a demonstration of parsing ambiguity with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
