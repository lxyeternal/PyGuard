{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate the use of explicit ambiguity handling in Lark's Earley parser for a simple grammar example.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded sentence string ('fruit flies like bananas') and uses the Lark parser to parse it. No external inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or external data transmission occurs. The parser's output is printed to the console.",
  "flows": "The input string is parsed by the Lark parser, and the resulting parse tree is printed in a pretty format. No data is sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code uses standard library functions and the Lark parser with explicit ambiguity support. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Lark parsing library and defines a simple ambiguous grammar. It then creates a parser with explicit ambiguity enabled. The code parses a predefined sentence and prints the parse tree. No user input is taken, no network activity or file operations are performed beyond commented-out functions for visualization. The code appears solely as a demonstration of parsing capabilities, with no malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign demonstration of using Lark's ambiguous parsing features. There are no malicious behaviors, no external data handling, and no security risks identified.",
