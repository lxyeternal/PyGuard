{
  "purpose": "Demonstrates how to parse ambiguous sentences using the Lark parser with explicit ambiguity handling.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, Lark, and tree modules; reads the hardcoded sentence string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code parses the sentence using the Lark parser, then optionally generates PNG or DOT representations from the parse tree.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a context-free grammar to parse sentences with ambiguity, constructs a parser with explicit ambiguity enabled, and parses a static sentence. The functions for visualizing parse trees are commented out, indicating no active external output or data exfiltration. No external network connections, no execution of untrusted input, and no suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of parsing ambiguous sentences with the Lark library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
