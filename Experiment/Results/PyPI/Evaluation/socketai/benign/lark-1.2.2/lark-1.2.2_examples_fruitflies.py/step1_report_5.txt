{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate how to use Lark's Earley parser to handle explicit ambiguity in parsing a simple sentence.",
  "sources": "Input sentence 'fruit flies like bananas' (hardcoded). No external data sources or user input are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected; no network, file, or environment variable access beyond imports.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code processes a hardcoded string and outputs a parse tree visualization without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; functions for visualization are commented out, and the code primarily demonstrates parsing capabilities.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Lark parsing library, defines a simple ambiguous grammar, parses a fixed sentence, and outputs the parse tree. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs is present. Visualization functions are provided but not invoked. No credentials, secrets, or sensitive operations are found.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign demonstration script for parsing ambiguity with no malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks identified.",
