{
  "purpose": "Demonstration of handling ambiguity in parsing using Lark's Earley parser with explicit ambiguity output.",
  "sources": "Reads a fixed string 'fruit flies like bananas' assigned to variable 'sentence'; imports from 'lark' module.",
  "sinks": "Uses parser.parse() which processes the input string; no direct sinks for untrusted data, no network or file output involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> parser.parse() -> parse tree -> optional visualization functions (commented out).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be for educational demonstration only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a grammar for parsing ambiguous sentences, creates a parser with explicit ambiguity handling, parses a fixed sentence, and has functions for visualizing parse trees. No external data sources or sinks are used beyond standard library and parsing functions. The commented-out visualization functions do not execute but are not suspicious. The code’s purpose is educational, with no suspicious or malicious code elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of parsing ambiguity using Lark. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It solely performs parsing of a static string and provides optional visualization functions.",
