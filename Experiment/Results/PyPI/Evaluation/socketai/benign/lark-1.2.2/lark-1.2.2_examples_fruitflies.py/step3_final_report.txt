  "purpose": "Demonstrate how to parse ambiguous sentences using Lark's Earley parser with explicit ambiguity handling.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded sentence 'fruit flies like bananas' within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file output involved.",
  "flows": "Parsing the static string with the Lark parser; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Functions for visualization are defined but commented out; no active external output or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static demonstration of parsing ambiguity using the Lark library. It defines a grammar, parses a fixed sentence, and includes visualization functions that are inactive. There are no external inputs, no network activity, no secrets, and no malicious code. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are consistent with the code's behavior. No logical flaws or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any risky operations or external communication, and the functions for visualization do not introduce any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational example demonstrating parsing ambiguity with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
