  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script intended for data processing or utility purposes, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; no user input, network requests, or file reads are evident in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present or invoked in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no apparent source-to-sink data flows; the code executes straightforward operations without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code are observed. The code structure appears typical for a utility script.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly. No malicious or suspicious behaviors were detected, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries is minimal or typical, and no unusual code constructs or obfuscated segments are present. The code performs basic operations without external data dependencies or risky functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious activity. It appears to be benign and safe for use. The overall security risk is low, and there are no significant threats identified.",
