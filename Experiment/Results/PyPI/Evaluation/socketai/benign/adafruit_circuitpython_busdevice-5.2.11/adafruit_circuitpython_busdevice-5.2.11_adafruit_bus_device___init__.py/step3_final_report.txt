  "purpose": "The code is a structured prompt for analysis, not executable code, serving as a template for security review.",
  "sources": "N/A (no actual code present; the prompt itself is the source)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow or untrusted data handling in the prompt)",
  "flows": "N/A (no execution flow; the prompt guides analysis but does not process data)",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets; the prompt is purely instructional",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a non-executable, structured prompt intended for analysis, not actual code. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior can be present in a prompt. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The security risk scores are uniformly low (0.2), reflecting cautious acknowledgment of limited context but no evidence of threats. Confidence levels are high (≥0.6), justified by the explicit descriptions. The reasoning across reports is consistent and appropriate, with no indications of false positives or overlooked issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the limited context but no suspicious activity. All assessments are consistent and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.",
