  "purpose": "Read a specific register (0x0E) from the DS3231 RTC device over I2C and print the result in hexadecimal format.",
  "sources": "Writing the register address 0x0E to the device, then reading one byte from the device.",
  "sinks": "Printing the read byte to the console.",
  "flows": "Write register address -> read byte from device -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward hardware communication with no obfuscation or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes I2C communication with a DS3231 RTC at address 0x68, writes the register address 0x0E, then reads a byte and prints it. All reports correctly identify this as standard hardware interaction with no malicious intent. No obfuscation, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward hardware interface for reading a register from a DS3231 RTC device. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores and analysis are consistent and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
