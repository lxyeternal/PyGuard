{
  "purpose": "To communicate with a BMP280 sensor over SPI protocol and read its device ID register.",
  "sources": "Reading the device ID register (0xD0) from the sensor via SPI communication.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; output is just printed to console.",
  "flows": "Code writes device register address, then reads a byte from the sensor, and prints the result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual logic; straightforward sensor communication.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for SPI communication, initializes SPI bus and chip select pin, performs a register read from the sensor, and prints the device ID. All operations are standard for sensor interfacing. No external or untrusted data sources are used; no data leaks, no network connections, no hidden code or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard hardware sensor communication with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is a typical sensor read routine.",
