  "purpose": "Setup for pytest fixtures involving system info, numpy, and loading static lattice data files for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "System platform info via platform.uname(), numpy version, and static data files ('dba.mat', 'hmba.mat') loaded via importlib.resources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data files are trusted static resources loaded into memory.",
  "flows": "System info and numpy version are gathered; data files are loaded into in-memory lattice structures for testing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with conditional imports based on Python version, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign setup tasks: gathering system info, importing modules, loading static data files for tests. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The data files are loaded from trusted package resources, and the code uses standard practices. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The slight risk score of 0.1 is a cautious acknowledgment of potential issues if files are compromised, but in a controlled test environment, this is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe test fixture setup with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are appropriate. The minimal risk score of 0.1 is justified as a conservative measure but does not indicate actual security concerns.",
