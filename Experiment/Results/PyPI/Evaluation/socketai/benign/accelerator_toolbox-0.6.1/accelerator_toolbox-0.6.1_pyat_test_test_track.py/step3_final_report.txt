{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based unit tests for physics simulation functions (lattice_track, lattice_pass, internal_lpass), validating input shapes, data integrity, and in-place modifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from numpy arrays (rin, lattice) and imported functions' parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or external effects; the code does not perform network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input numpy arrays through the functions under test, with assertions verifying data integrity; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of unit tests that manipulate numpy arrays, invoke imported physics functions, and perform assertions to verify behavior. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious code patterns are evident. The functions tested are external modules, likely complex physics calculations, but their internal implementation cannot be assessed here. The test code itself is standard, readable, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard scientific testing suite with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
