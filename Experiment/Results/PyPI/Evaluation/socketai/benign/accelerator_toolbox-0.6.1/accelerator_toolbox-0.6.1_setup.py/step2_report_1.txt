  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build script; sources are environment variables, filesystem checks, and source files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data exfiltration or network activity; build commands are generated locally.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No secrets, no obfuscation. The use of `eval()` on environment variables is common but can be risky if environment variables are maliciously set. However, in controlled build environments, this is typical.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected. The script is a typical build configuration with no signs of sabotage.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code or payloads)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (minimal, due to `eval()` usage, but standard in build scripts)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on build configuration.  \n- No suspicious network activity or data leaks.  \n- Uses environment variables to influence build flags, which is standard.  \n- No obfuscation or secrets.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Focuses on platform-specific build flags and environment variables.  \n- No malicious commands or network activity.  \n- Use of `eval()` is noted but is typical for build scripts.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports; environment variables control build options.  \n- No suspicious activity or code execution beyond standard build configuration.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Again, a standard build script with environment-dependent configuration.  \n- No network, data exfiltration, or malicious code.  \n- Use of `eval()` on environment variables is noted but is common in such scripts.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is a standard setup script for building native extensions, with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only concern is the use of `eval()` on environment variables, which could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously set. However, this is a common pattern in build scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; mainly the theoretical risk associated with `eval()` in a build context, which is standard practice.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious payloads or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to `eval()` on environment variables, but acceptable in controlled build environments)\n\n**Note:** If the environment variables are manipulated maliciously, it could influence build flags, but this is a typical risk in build scripts and not indicative of malicious intent by the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, well-structured build configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The use of `eval()` is a minor concern but standard in such contexts. Overall, the security posture is very good, with minimal risk.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2",
