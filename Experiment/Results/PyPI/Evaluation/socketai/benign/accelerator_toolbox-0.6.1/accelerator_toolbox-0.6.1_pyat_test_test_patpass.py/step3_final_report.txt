  "purpose": "A test suite for particle tracking and physics simulation functions, verifying output shapes and values.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'at' module, numpy array initializations, function calls with parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from initial numpy arrays flows through function calls to assertions.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out platform check code; no suspicious or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward scientific testing script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The commented platform check is benign. All signals indicate a benign, standard test suite for physics functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard scientific test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security concern related to commented-out platform-specific code does not elevate the overall risk significantly.",
