  "sources": "Imports from local module '.ad_manager'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and contains only licensing information, imports, and a docstring. No suspicious or unusual code constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header with license comments, a descriptive docstring, and an import statement. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or contain logic that could be exploited. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The import from a local module suggests it is part of a larger package. No obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module stub with licensing info and a single import. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
