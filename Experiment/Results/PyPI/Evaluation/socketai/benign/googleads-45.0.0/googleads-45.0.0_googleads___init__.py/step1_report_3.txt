  "purpose": "A client library for Google's SOAP Ads APIs, intended for interacting with Google's ad management services.",
  "sources": "Imports the AdManagerClient class from a local module (.ad_manager).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is primarily importing a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments and a single import statement; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module with licensing information and a single import statement for AdManagerClient from a local module. There are no input handling, data processing, or output operations that could be exploited. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign client library module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely imports a class, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
