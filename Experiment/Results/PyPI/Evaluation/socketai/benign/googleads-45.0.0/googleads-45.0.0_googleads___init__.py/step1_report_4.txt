  "anomalies": "Presence of only import statement; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and an import statement for a module within the package. There are no executable statements, no data handling, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be a small fragment of a larger library without any malicious activity. No security risks or malware indications are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard library module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply imports a class from a local module to be used elsewhere.",
