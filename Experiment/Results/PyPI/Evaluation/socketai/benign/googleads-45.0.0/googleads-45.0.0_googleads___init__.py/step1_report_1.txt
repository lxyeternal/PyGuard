  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.ad_manager import AdManagerClient)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Only licensing comments and a simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code contains licensing information, comments, and a single import statement. No dynamic code, no data handling, and no suspicious activities are present. The import suggests a modular design, typical for client libraries. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard part of a client library with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It merely includes licensing comments and an import statement, indicating a typical setup file.",
