  "purpose": "A minimal Python module containing licensing comments and a single import statement, serving as part of a client library.",
  "sources": "The import statement `from .ad_manager import AdManagerClient`",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved",
  "flows": "No data flows; static import without dynamic execution or data handling",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation; licensing comments are standard and benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static module with licensing comments and a single import statement. It contains no executable logic, data flows, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators. Confidence levels are appropriate; the code's benign nature is clear and unambiguous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard part of a client library with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further review or action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
