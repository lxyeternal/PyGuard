  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python setup script for the 'googleads' library.\n- It reads the version number from a local file ('googleads/common.py') using a regex.\n- It defines dependencies, classifiers, and package metadata.\n- No external data is processed beyond local file reading.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code aligns with typical setup practices.\n\n**Detailed review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or flows; only internal file reading.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scoring is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- Same as above, emphasizing standard practices.\n- No external data or malicious activity.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Similar findings; standard setup script.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious behavior.\n- Scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Same conclusion: standard setup code, reading version info locally.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Consistent with previous reports.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- Scores are aligned with the benign analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0; standard setup script with no security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the thorough analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a legitimate, standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a typical setup script for a Python package.  \n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scoring. No changes needed.",
