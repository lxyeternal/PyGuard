  "purpose": "Setup script for the Google Ads Python Client Library, used to install and configure the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the version information from 'googleads/common.py' to determine package version.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the script does not process untrusted data directly or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to extract version number; no other data flow or execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code detected; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard package setup tasks, including reading a version string from a file. It uses regex to parse the version, which is common practice. No untrusted data sources, network operations, or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward, and there are no indicators of malicious intent or malware behavior. The code adheres to typical Python packaging standards without any obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is legitimate, standard code for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
