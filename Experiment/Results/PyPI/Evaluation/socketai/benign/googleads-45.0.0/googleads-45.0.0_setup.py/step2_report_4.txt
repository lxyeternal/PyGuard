  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package.\n- The only file operation involves reading a local source file ('common.py') to extract the version string.\n- No external network activity, user input handling, or untrusted data processing is present.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are identified.\n- The code follows typical Python packaging conventions.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The function `GetVersion()` reads a local file and uses regex to extract the version. This is a common pattern in setup scripts.\n- The script defines dependencies, package metadata, and calls `setuptools.setup()` accordingly.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident in the code.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing untrusted code, network communication, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0. The script performs standard package setup tasks with no security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify this as a legitimate, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis setup script is safe, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious activity.",
