  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports agree that the script is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing typical operations such as reading a local version file and defining dependencies. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. The code reads the version string from 'googleads/common.py' using a regex, which is a common pattern.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The code appears correct and follows standard practices. No logical flaws or errors are identified. The regex used to extract the version is straightforward and appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the analysis that this is a benign setup script. These scores seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   Since all assessments conclude no malicious activity or security issues, the risk score should remain at 0. The code does not perform any network activity, handle untrusted input, or contain any suspicious constructs.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The script does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the code's behavior, which is standard for setup scripts. No unwarranted assumptions are made about malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It reads version info from a local file, defines dependencies, and calls `setuptools.setup()`. All evidence points to a legitimate, safe package configuration script.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe script is a standard, safe setup script for a Python package, with no malicious or security concerns.",
