  "purpose": "Setup script for the Google Ads Python Client Library, used to install and configure the package and its dependencies.",
  "sources": "File reading for version extraction from 'googleads/common.py'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no direct data output or external communication in this script.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a source file; no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code follows standard package setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading version info from a local file, defining dependencies, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. It does not execute any untrusted code, communicate externally, or contain obfuscated logic. The only file I/O is reading a local source file to extract version info, which is a common practice in setup scripts. No malicious behavior or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate installation and configuration of the 'googleads' library.",
