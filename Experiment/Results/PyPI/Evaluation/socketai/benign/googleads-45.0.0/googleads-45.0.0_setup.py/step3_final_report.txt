  "purpose": "Setup script for the googleads Python Client Library, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'googleads/common.py' using a regex.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; only local file reading occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> extracts version -> proceeds with setup; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script that reads a local version file, defines dependencies and metadata, and calls setuptools.setup(). No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The regex used for version extraction is simple and safe. The script does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. All signals indicate a benign, standard package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign setup configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
