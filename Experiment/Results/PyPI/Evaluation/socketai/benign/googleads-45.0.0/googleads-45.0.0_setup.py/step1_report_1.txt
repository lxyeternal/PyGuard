  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the googleads Python Client Library, used to install and manage the package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'common.py' file within the 'googleads' directory to extract the version number.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks that handle user input or external data beyond reading a file internally.",
  "flows": "Reads the version string from a local file and passes package information to the setup function; no external data flow or network communication involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading a local version file, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. The only file reading is internal, for version retrieval. No suspicious or malicious behaviors detected, and the code aligns with standard Python package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads internal files to obtain version info and defines dependencies for package installation.",
