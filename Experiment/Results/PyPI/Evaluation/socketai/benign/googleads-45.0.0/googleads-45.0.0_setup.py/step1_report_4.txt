  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the Google Ads Python Client Library.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'googleads/common.py' file; reads long description from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified; no network or sensitive data operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file; no external data flow or user input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code is a standard setup script with typical package metadata and dependency definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package configuration using setuptools, including reading the version from a local file. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are evident. It references dependencies and package information in a standard manner. The only potentially sensitive operation is reading the version string from a file, which is typical in setup scripts. No network activity or data leaks are present. The code aligns with standard Python package setup practices and does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package installation configuration without any suspicious activities.",
