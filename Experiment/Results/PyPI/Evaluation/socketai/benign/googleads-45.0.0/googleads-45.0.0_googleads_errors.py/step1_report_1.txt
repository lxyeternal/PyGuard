  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the Google Ads Client Library.",
  "sources": "None; code does not read input or data from external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not send data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code contains standard exception class definitions with normal usage.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions inheriting from Exception to represent various error types used by a library. It includes standard __init__ methods and docstrings. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be purely structural, defining error handling mechanisms without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It serves as error handling scaffolding for a client library, with no external data access or execution flow.",
