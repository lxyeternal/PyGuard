  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code is a set of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's Exception class.\n   - It does not read external data, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with constructors that assign attributes and generate error messages.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code appears purely structural, serving as error handling scaffolding.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious activity.\n   - They emphasize the absence of external data flows, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The scores are all zero, which is justified because the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n   - No reason exists to elevate the risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The malware score of 0 is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard error class definitions.\n   - No overreach or unwarranted suspicion is present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - All scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:\n- The code is benign, standard, and serves as error handling classes.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n- The scores are justified and align with the code's nature.\n\n**My Own Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk detected)\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and non-malicious, serving a typical purpose within a client library.",
