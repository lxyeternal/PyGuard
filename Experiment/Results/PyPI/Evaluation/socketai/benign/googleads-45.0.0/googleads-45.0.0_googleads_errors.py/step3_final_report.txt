  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Google Ads Client Library.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed during exception instantiation (e.g., document, errors, message, report_job_id). No external data sources or input reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with parameters; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, used for categorizing errors. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic code execution. All parameters are passed during object creation and stored as attributes. The structure is standard for error handling in Python. No external data access, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves a purely structural purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom error classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
