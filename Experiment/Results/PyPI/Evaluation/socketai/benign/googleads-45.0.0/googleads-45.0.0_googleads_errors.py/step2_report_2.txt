  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a set of custom exception classes for error handling in the Google Ads Client Library.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data access, network operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The constructors simply assign parameters to attributes or generate messages, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not read external data, perform network operations, or execute any code dynamically. It is purely structural.\n- **Malware potential:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, as the code is only defining error classes.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** Given the absence of any malicious indicators, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Confirmed as 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely structural with no security implications, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
