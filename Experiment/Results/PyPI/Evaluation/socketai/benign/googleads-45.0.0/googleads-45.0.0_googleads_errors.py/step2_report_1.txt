  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a set of custom exception classes for error handling in the Google Ads Client Library.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard, and does not perform any external data access, network operations, or malicious activities.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The classes are used solely for internal error categorization and reporting.\n\n**Confirmations & Observations:**\n- The code does not read external input or data; all parameters are passed during instantiation.\n- There are no external sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious behavior.\n- The constructors assign parameters to class attributes and generate error messages but do not perform any external operations.\n- The code structure is typical for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code appears to be well-structured and idiomatic.\n- No issues with the implementation or reasoning.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0; there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Adjustments:**\n- Since all evidence points to benign, standard error class definitions, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is purely structural, with no malicious or security-related concerns.\n- The scores assigned (obfuscated=0, malware=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, safe implementation of custom error classes for a client library. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current scores are appropriate.",
