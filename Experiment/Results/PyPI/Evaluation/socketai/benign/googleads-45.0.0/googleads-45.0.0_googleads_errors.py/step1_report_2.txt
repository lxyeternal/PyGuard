{
  "purpose": "Define custom error classes used by the Google Ads Client Library for error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or user inputs are read; class constructors receive parameters during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing; error objects are instantiated and stored internally.",
  "flows": "Error class constructors assign parameters to class attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; code follows standard error class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base error class. The classes are used to represent different error conditions within the library. The constructor of 'GoogleAdsServerFault' stores a document and errors, but these are likely internal objects, not user input or external data. The 'AdManagerReportError' class constructs an error message with a report ID, which appears to be an internal identifier passed at instantiation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward error handling classes with standard Python inheritance and initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
