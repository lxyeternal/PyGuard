  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Google Ads Client Library error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class initializations and exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no output or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising within class constructors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard exception class definitions and inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises only class definitions for custom exceptions with no input/output, data processing, or network operations. The classes are used for error handling and contain no embedded malicious code or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution are present. The structure and content are typical of a library error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
