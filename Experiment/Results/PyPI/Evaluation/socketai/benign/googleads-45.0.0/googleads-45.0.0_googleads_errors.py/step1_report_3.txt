{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Google Ads Client Library.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from parameters in class constructors (e.g., document, errors, message, report_job_id). No external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Error messages and attributes such as 'message' and 'report_job_id' are used for reporting errors, but do not lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters flow into exception messages and attributes but are not propagated to external systems or outputs outside error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior detected. The code adheres to standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for handling various errors in the Google Ads Client Library. It uses standard inheritance from Python's Exception class. The constructors assign error details such as messages, error lists, and identifiers but do not perform any data processing or external actions. No input/output operations, network activity, or data manipulation are present. Overall, the code appears to serve as structured error handling without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error management, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.",
