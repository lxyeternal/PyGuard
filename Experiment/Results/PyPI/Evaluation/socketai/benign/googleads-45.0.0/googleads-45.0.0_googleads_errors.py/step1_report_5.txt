  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes used by the Google Ads Client Library for error handling.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it solely defines classes and their constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted sources; the classes are used for exception handling within the application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions inheriting from Python's base Exception class. The classes include error descriptions and constructors that initialize error messages and attributes. The code appears to be standard, clean, and intended solely for error categorization. No suspicious or malicious patterns, external data processing, or code execution features are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for a client library. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and exhibits no obfuscation. The purpose is purely to facilitate error handling within the library.",
