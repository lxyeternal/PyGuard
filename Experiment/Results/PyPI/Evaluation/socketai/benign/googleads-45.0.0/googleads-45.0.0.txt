The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.2) accounts for typical network and configuration handling risks inherent in SDKs but does not indicate malicious behavior."

The low security risk score (0.2) assigned in the reports is justified, reflecting minimal risk associated with sensitive data handling. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its intended purpose."
