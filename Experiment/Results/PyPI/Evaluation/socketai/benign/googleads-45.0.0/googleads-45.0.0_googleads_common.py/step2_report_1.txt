  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard client library functions for Google Ads API, with configuration via YAML, environment variables, and standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network communication (build_opener, zeep.Client), file access, dynamic method creation, HTTP headers.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of dynamic imports and network handlers is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a well-structured SDK for API communication, with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. All network and file operations are consistent with legitimate SDK behavior.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, typical for SDKs with network operations)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on configuration loading, OAuth2, proxy, and SOAP communication.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests via zeep and requests, with potential for manipulation if input is malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, no obfuscation. Warnings for deprecation and encoding are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard client library, no signs of malicious activity. Proxy and SSL configurations are typical, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages configuration, proxies, and SOAP requests.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network communication, with data from YAML and environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or backdoors; standard libraries and patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK code, with no malicious behavior or sabotage.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, configuration, proxy, and SOAP communication.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests, SOAP message creation.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or suspicious code; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** A legitimate client library with no indicators of malicious activity.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on configuration, proxy, SSL, and SOAP handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network, SOAP messages, environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** No backdoors or obfuscation; standard practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured SDK code, no malicious intent.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports show no signs of malicious activity. The code is a standard SDK for API communication.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are low, reflecting typical SDK behavior with network operations and configuration handling.\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** ~0.2 (standard SDK risk, mainly due to network and configuration handling, but no malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured client library for Google Ads API, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low risk scores are appropriate given the context.\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed analysis is needed.",
