  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source client library for Google Ads API, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.2) accounts for typical network and configuration handling risks inherent in SDKs but does not indicate malicious behavior."
