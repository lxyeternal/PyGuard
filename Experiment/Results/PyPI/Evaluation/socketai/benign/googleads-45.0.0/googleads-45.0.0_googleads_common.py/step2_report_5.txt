  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the validity of the claims, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any suspicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a client library for Google Ads API, handling configuration, OAuth2, proxies, SOAP, and utilities. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 (low, typical for network/configuration code)\n- **Confidence**: 0.9\n\n**Assessment**: The report correctly identifies that the code is standard SDK/library code for API interaction. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing configuration, proxy, and SOAP communication. No malicious patterns or obfuscation observed.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose. No signs of malicious intent. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, a standard client library for Google Ads API, with configuration and network setup. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**: Consistent with the previous reports; the code is legitimate SDK code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Focuses on configuration, proxy, SSL, and SOAP communication. No malicious activity or obfuscation. Uses standard practices.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very low, typical for network setup code)\n\n**Assessment**: The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical client SDK.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to others—configuration, proxy, SSL, SOAP handling, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**: The analysis is consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Activity**: All reports agree that the code is a standard SDK/client library for Google Ads API. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- **Obfuscation**: The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or hidden logic.\n- **Scores**:\n  - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n  - **Obfuscated**: All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n  - **Risk**: Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the code's network and configuration handling. These are low risks typical for SDKs that handle network communications and credentials.\n\n### Final Estimations\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.1** — minimal, related to network configuration, proxy, and SSL contexts, which are standard but could be exploited if misconfigured. Still, no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a legitimate, open-source client library for Google Ads API interaction. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
