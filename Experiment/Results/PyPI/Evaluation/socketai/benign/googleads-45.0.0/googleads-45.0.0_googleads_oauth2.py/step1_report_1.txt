{
  "purpose": "Provides OAuth2 authentication clients for Google APIs, enabling authorization via tokens, refresh tokens, service accounts, or credentials objects.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include static access tokens, refresh tokens, credentials objects, key files, and API name strings.",
  "sinks": "Creates OAuth2 HTTP headers with Bearer tokens for API requests, and refreshes tokens when expired.",
  "flows": "Source data (tokens, credentials, files) is used to generate OAuth2 headers; headers are used in API requests; tokens are refreshed as needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unexpected data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard OAuth2 client functionality with proper token management, including token refreshes and credential handling. Usage of external libraries (google-auth, requests) is appropriate for OAuth2 flows. No signs of malicious activities such as unauthorized data exfiltration, malicious network connections, or backdoors are present. The code maintains secure handling of tokens and credentials with no hardcoded secrets. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of OAuth2 clients for Google APIs, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages credentials and token refresh processes without exposing sensitive information or performing any malicious actions.",
