  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the technical details, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a standard OAuth2 client implementation for Google APIs, with no malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It emphasizes proper token management and secure handling.\n\n- **Findings:** The code matches typical OAuth2 client patterns, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (0.1). The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's functionality. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing secure credential management, network requests during token refresh, and no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Findings:** The code performs standard OAuth2 flows, uses Google libraries, and handles tokens securely. No obfuscation or backdoors. Malware score is 0, risk is low.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard OAuth2 client with typical network interactions during token refresh, no secrets hardcoded, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity.\n\n- **Findings:** The code's behavior is typical for OAuth2 clients, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is justified. Malware score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard OAuth2 client, manages tokens securely, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Network requests are standard.\n\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is appropriate. Malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: standard OAuth2 client, proper credential handling, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Findings:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses established libraries and standard flows.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code provided is a legitimate OAuth2 client implementation for Google APIs. It matches common patterns, uses official libraries, and handles tokens securely.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Security Risk:** The low risk scores (~0.1) are justified, given the code manages credentials securely and performs expected network operations.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** No suspicious network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution. All behaviors are standard for OAuth2 clients.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.1) are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (≥0.9) in the assessments is justified.\n\n- **Additional Notes:** No evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities is present. The code appears to be a well-implemented OAuth2 client library.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, secure OAuth2 client implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect a low-security risk with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
