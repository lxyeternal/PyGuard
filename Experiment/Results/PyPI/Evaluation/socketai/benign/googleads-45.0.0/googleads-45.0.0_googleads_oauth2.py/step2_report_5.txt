  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code provides OAuth2 clients for Google APIs, manages tokens securely, no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk score aligns with the low likelihood of issues.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes secure credential management, no suspicious network activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code handles OAuth2 flows properly, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard OAuth2 client functionality, no malicious activity, proper token refreshes, no hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code. No suspicious behavior is identified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard OAuth2 handling, no obfuscation or malicious signs.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Again, standard OAuth2 client implementation, no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning matches the code's behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. The code performs credential management and network requests for token refresh, which are standard OAuth2 operations, not malicious activities.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.1, indicating minimal security risk, which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard OAuth2 client implementation, using well-established libraries (`google-auth`, `requests`).  \n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.  \n- The network requests are to official Google endpoints, typical for OAuth2 flows.  \n- The code handles tokens securely, with proper refresh mechanisms.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, standard OAuth2 client implementation with minimal risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are accurate and justified based on the code review. The code appears secure, standard, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements.",
