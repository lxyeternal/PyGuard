{
  "purpose": "The code provides OAuth2 authentication clients for Google APIs, enabling authorization and token management within the googleads library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from hardcoded constants (SCOPES, URLs), function arguments (api_name, credentials, tokens, file paths), environment variables (via passed credentials), and network requests (refresh tokens, access tokens).",
  "sinks": "HTTP headers with authorization tokens, token refresh requests, network requests to Google OAuth endpoints, file reading for service account keys.",
  "flows": "Input credentials and tokens are used to generate OAuth2 headers; refresh tokens or access tokens are used in network requests to refresh or obtain new tokens; these headers are then used for API requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets such as API keys or passwords are present. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is evident. The code does perform network requests to token endpoints, but this is standard for OAuth2 clients. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network connections are detected. Proxy configuration is optional and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard OAuth2 authentication clients, handling token refresh, credential management, and HTTP header creation. It uses established Google libraries and standard network request procedures. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data leaks, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The only network interactions are token refresh flows, which are necessary for OAuth2. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of OAuth2 clients for Google APIs, with no malicious or sabotage intent detected. It follows common security practices for credential handling and network requests, and there are no indicators of malware or malicious behavior.",
