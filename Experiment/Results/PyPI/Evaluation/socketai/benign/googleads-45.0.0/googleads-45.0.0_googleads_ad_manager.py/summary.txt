  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-maintained client library for Google Ad Manager API with no malicious intent or sabotage detected. The absence of secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity confirms its benign nature. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
