{
  "purpose": "The code provides a client library for interacting with the Google Ad Manager API, including report downloading and PQL query execution.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided parameters, environment variables (though none explicitly used here), and external API responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network requests (report download URLs, API service calls), file writes (report output, CSV data), and data serialization/deserialization for API communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input (parameters, query strings) through API service calls, then into report or PQL result processing, and finally to file or network output streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns identified. Usage of environment variables is minimal and controlled. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly constructs and executes API requests, handles report and query downloads, and processes data for CSV output. All network interactions occur through standard library functions with no suspicious endpoints or data exfiltration patterns. The code does not contain any code injection, dynamic code execution, or data leakage mechanisms. It relies on external libraries and API responses for its operation. No malicious intent or sabotage signs are evident. Security considerations such as input validation are present in the form of type checks and error handling, but nothing indicates malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard client library for Google Ad Manager API interactions. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage components. It performs expected API operations, report downloading, and data handling functions without suspicious or harmful behavior.",
