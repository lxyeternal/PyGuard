  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check for code issues, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard client library for Google Ad Manager API, with inputs from method parameters and environment minimally.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests, SOAP headers, file writes—typical for such a client.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis:** The report states the code is well-structured, uses standard patterns, and shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low). The low risk score seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The code is a legitimate API client with no signs of malicious intent. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API client functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network calls, CSV writing, HTTP headers—standard for report download and data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or secrets; no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code appears to be a typical, well-implemented client library. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—appropriate for such a library.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, with data from parameters, environment, and API responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests, file writes, API interactions—standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent; the code is a typical API client.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues detected; scores align.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—API interactions, report download, PQL queries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network, file, data serialization.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard client library; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on query and report handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network, files, data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard API client functions; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1—appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly varied but generally low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent, well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — standard API client with minimal external dependencies and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, open-source client library for Google Ad Manager API. It performs network requests, data handling, and report downloading as expected, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores given are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**No changes needed.**",
