  "purpose": "A standard client library for interacting with the Google Ad Manager API, facilitating report downloads, query building, and service interactions.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, environment variables, external URLs for report download, API responses.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, SOAP headers, file writes, HTTP headers.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through API calls, report URL fetches, and file output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious network activity, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, open-source API client library utilizing standard modules and patterns. It performs network requests, report downloads, and data serialization without any signs of malicious behavior. No secrets or obfuscation are present. The network interactions are typical for such clients, and error handling appears appropriate. The data flows are confined within authorized API interactions, with no indications of sabotage or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-maintained client library for Google Ad Manager API with no malicious intent or sabotage detected. The absence of secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity confirms its benign nature. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
