  "purpose": "Configure serve paths, scripts, styles, and client setup for a Vue 3 frontend in a Python server environment.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__, __version__, and server.client_type.",
  "sinks": "None of the data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code constructs URLs and file paths from trusted variables; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines file paths, URLs, and a setup function that checks server configuration. It uses trusted variables (__file__, __version__, server attributes). There are no dynamic code executions, network communications beyond static URLs, or other malicious patterns. The use of string formatting appears safe, and the conditional check for client_type is standard. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a frontend component, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
