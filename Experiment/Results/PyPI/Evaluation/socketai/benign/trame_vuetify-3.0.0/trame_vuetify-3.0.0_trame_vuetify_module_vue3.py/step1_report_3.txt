  "purpose": "Configure paths, scripts, styles, and setup for a Vue 3 frontend within a Python server environment.",
  "sources": "Reads from __file__ to determine path; accesses __version__ from trame_vuetify; reads 'client_type' attribute from server object; accesses 'trame__vuetify3_config' from trame.state.",
  "sinks": "Raises TypeError if server.client_type != 'vue3'.",
  "flows": "Path and version information are used to construct URLs and file paths; server's 'client_type' is checked to ensure correct client version; potentially reads 'trame__vuetify3_config' from state for configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network requests, or malicious code detected. The code performs straightforward configuration and validation without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs file paths and resource URLs based on the module's version and location, which is standard. It performs a server configuration check to ensure 'client_type' matches expected 'vue3', raising an exception if not. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. It primarily facilitates frontend setup with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration script for a Vue 3 frontend, with standard path manipulations and a simple server validation check. No malicious or suspicious elements are present.",
