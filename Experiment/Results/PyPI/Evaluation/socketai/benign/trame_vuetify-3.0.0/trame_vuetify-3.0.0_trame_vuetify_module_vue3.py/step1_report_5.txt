{
  "purpose": "Configure and serve Vue 3 related static files and setup client type validation in a server environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements, __version__ variable, server.client_type attribute, and __file__ for file paths.",
  "sinks": "None that pose security risks. No untrusted data is written or executed directly from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info and file paths, and checks server attribute; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded strings and URLs is typical; no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up static file paths and configuration validation. It does not include dynamic code execution, network communications, or credential handling. The use of __file__ and version info is safe. The validation function raises an error if the server's client_type isn't 'vue3', which is a standard check. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving static assets and performing a simple server configuration check. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
