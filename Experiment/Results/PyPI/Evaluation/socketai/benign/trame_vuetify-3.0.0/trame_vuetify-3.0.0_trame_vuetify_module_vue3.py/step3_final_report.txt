{
  "purpose": "This code sets up resource paths and URLs for Vue 3 frontend assets, and validates that the server's client type is 'vue3'.",
  "sources": "Uses __file__ to determine resource directory, and __version__ for versioning; reads server.client_type attribute for validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; validation raises exception if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Path and URL construction from trusted variables; validation flow from server attribute check to exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward resource setup and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs resource paths and URLs based on the script location and version, then performs a simple validation of server.client_type. No external network activity, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution. The validation ensures correct client type, which is a standard configuration check. External URL for fonts is benign. The code's behavior is static and predictable, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for serving static assets with a simple validation check. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and the current scores are appropriate.",
