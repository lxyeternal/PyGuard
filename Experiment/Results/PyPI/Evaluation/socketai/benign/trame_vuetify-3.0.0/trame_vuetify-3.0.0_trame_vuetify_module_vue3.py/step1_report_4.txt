{
  "purpose": "This code sets up paths and configurations for serving Vue.js 3 components with specific styles, scripts, and versioning information. It also includes a setup function to verify server client type.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from module attributes (__version__, __file__, server object attributes like server.client_type, and external URLs for fonts).",
  "sinks": "The code constructs URLs and strings for serving static files, and raises exceptions based on input parameters. No data is sent over the network or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "The code constructs file paths and URLs based on known attributes and verifies server configuration, with no untrusted data flow from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The only dynamic aspect is configuration verification, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs paths and URLs using module attributes and verifies server configuration, with no evidence of malicious intent. External URL usage is for font loading, which is standard. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The setup function simply checks the server's client_type attribute and raises an error if mismatched, which is a normal validation step.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration and setup script for serving static Vue.js assets. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
