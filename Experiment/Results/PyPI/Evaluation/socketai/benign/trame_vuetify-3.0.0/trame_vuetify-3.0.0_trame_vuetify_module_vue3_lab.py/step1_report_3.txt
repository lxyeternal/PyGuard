{
  "purpose": "The code sets up paths, scripts, styles, and configuration for a Vue.js-based frontend with specific versioning and server setup validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads __file__, __version__, and server attributes such as server.client_type.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or interacts with external untrusted inputs directly; the only potentially dynamic data is server.client_type which is validated.",
  "flows": "__file__ and __version__ influence path and script/style configuration; server.client_type is checked to enforce expected client type.",
  "anomalies": "Use of potentially dynamic variables (__file__, __version__) in paths and script URLs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically constructs paths and URLs based on module version and file location, which is standard. It validates server.client_type to ensure it is 'vue3', raising an error if not, which is a security measure. No untrusted input appears to influence the code flow in a harmful way. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard setup tasks with dynamic path and URL construction and a client type check. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
