{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up paths and configurations for a Vue.js frontend integration within a Python server environment, likely for serving frontend assets and configuring the client-side framework.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path (__file__), the package version (__version__), and server object attributes (server.client_type). It also references external URLs for stylesheets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the use of 'trame.state.get' within a string, which could evaluate untrusted data if the string is executed as code, but in this context it is simply a string, not executed.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves 'trame.state.get' being included as part of a JavaScript snippet, but there's no actual code execution or data transfer in Python—it's just string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and primarily for configuration. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs paths based on the current file location and version, prepares asset URLs, and defines a setup function that verifies the server's client type. It raises an exception if the server's client type isn't 'vue3'. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the string 'trame.state.get' is used as part of a JS expression in a string, which is standard in web app configs. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration code for a frontend setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any unsafe operations, data leaks, or external malicious interactions.",
