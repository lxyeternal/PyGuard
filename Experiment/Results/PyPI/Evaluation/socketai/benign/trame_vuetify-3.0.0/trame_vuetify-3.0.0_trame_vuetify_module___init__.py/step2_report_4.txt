  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The function `setup` assigns a default `client_type` (\"vue3\") or uses `server.client_type` if available.\n- Based on `client_type`, it imports either `.vue2` or `.vue3` modules.\n- It then calls `server.enable_module()` with the imported module.\n- If `client_type` is unknown, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code performs straightforward conditional imports and method calls based on a server attribute. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, straightforward logic, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1  \n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, benign setup routine.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), but still benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The small securityRisk reflects minimal concern, perhaps due to dynamic import, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2), but still standard configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9  \n- **Assessment:** Acceptable. The risk score aligns with the fact that dynamic imports could be a minor concern if misused, but here they are straightforward.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9  \n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports assign `malware=0` and `obfuscated=0`, which is consistent with the code's nature. No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n\n### Security Risk:\n- Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are justified due to dynamic import patterns, but no actual vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or suspicious assumptions are present.\n- The code handles unknown `client_type` safely by raising an exception.\n- Import statements are static relative imports, not constructed from untrusted input.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No modifications needed; the analysis aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to dynamic import pattern, but no real risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe configuration routine with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores reflect this accurately.",
