  "purpose": "Configure and enable a specific client module (vue2 or vue3) based on the server's client_type attribute.",
  "sources": "Reading server.client_type attribute",
  "sinks": "Importing modules (.vue2 or .vue3) and calling server.enable_module()",
  "flows": "Reading server.client_type -> Conditional branch -> Importing module -> Enabling module",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of import statements within function scope is not inherently suspicious. No dynamic code execution or external data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code determines which Vue.js client version to initialize based on the server object's attribute. It dynamically imports local modules (vue2 or vue3) and enables them via server's method. The import is conditional but straightforward, with no apparent obfuscation or malicious code. No data leakage, code injection, or external communication observed. The error handling is standard for unknown client types.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup routine for enabling client-specific modules. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply dynamically imports and enables modules based on a server attribute.",
