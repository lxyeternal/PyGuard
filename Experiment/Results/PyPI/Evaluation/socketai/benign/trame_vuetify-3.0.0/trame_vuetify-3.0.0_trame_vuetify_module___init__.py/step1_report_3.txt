  "purpose": "Initialize and enable a specific client module ('vue2' or 'vue3') based on the server's client_type attribute.",
  "sources": "Accessing server.client_type attribute; importing modules (.vue2 or .vue3) dynamically based on client_type.",
  "sinks": "Enabling server modules via server.enable_module() which loads the imported module.",
  "flows": "Reads server.client_type → conditionally imports vue2 or vue3 → calls server.enable_module() with the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import statements inside conditionals is typical and not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. No external input other than server.client_type is used.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a default client_type and overrides it if server has that attribute. It then conditionally imports and enables the corresponding module. The import statements are standard relative imports and are conditioned on a known string. No untrusted data processing, no code injection, and no suspicious data flow observed. The logic appears straightforward, with proper error handling for unknown client_type values.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration setup for module initialization based on server attributes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected.",
