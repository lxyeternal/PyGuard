  "purpose": "This function sets up modules based on the client type (vue2 or vue3) for a server object.",
  "sources": "Reading server.client_type attribute; importing vue2 or vue3 modules conditionally.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data or user input; module importation based on attribute check.",
  "flows": "server.client_type -> conditional branch -> import module -> enable_module method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports based on an attribute; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup function that configures modules based on the server's client_type attribute. It assigns a default value, then conditionally imports either vue2 or vue3 modules and enables them on the server object. The attribute check is straightforward, and module imports are standard Python syntax. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as obfuscated code, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The code is simple, and its purpose appears benign. There are no hidden or backdoor behaviors, and the logic aligns with typical modular setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup routine for initializing client-specific modules on a server object. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate configuration function.",
