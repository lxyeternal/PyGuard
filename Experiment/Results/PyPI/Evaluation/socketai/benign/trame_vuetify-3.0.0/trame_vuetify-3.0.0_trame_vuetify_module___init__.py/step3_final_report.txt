  "purpose": "Configure and enable client-specific modules ('vue2' or 'vue3') on the server based on the server's client_type attribute.",
  "sources": "Reading server.client_type attribute within the setup function.",
  "sinks": "Calling server.enable_module() with imported modules.",
  "flows": "Read server.client_type -> conditional import of vue2 or vue3 -> server.enable_module() with imported module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of static relative imports within a function scope; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward configuration task: it assigns a default client_type, overrides it if present, conditionally imports modules based on client_type, and enables them via server. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data processing are present. The import statements are static and controlled. Error handling for unknown client_type is appropriate. The logic is simple and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard setup routine without malicious activity or security risks. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. Minor security risk scores could be lowered to zero, but overall, the code is safe.",
