  "purpose": "Initialize and configure client-specific modules ('vue2' or 'vue3') based on server attributes.",
  "sources": "Reading 'server.client_type' attribute and potentially importing 'vue2' or 'vue3' modules.",
  "sinks": "Enabling modules via 'server.enable_module' which could affect server behavior or loaded functionality.",
  "flows": "Checks 'server.client_type', then imports corresponding module and enables it; raises error if unknown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import within conditional statements is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The function reads 'server.client_type' to determine which client module to enable. It performs conditional logic based on this attribute. The import statements are straightforward and depend on the 'client_type' value. The code raises an error for unknown types, which is a good safety measure. No external input is directly processed, and there are no signs of malicious code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logic is simple configuration logic without any obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup function for client modules with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It handles known client types securely and raises an error for unknown types, indicating robust input validation.",
