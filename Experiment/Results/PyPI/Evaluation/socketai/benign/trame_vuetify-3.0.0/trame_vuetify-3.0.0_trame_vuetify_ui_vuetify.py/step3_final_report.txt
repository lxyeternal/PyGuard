  "purpose": "UI layout definitions for trame and vuetify components, including version info display and server reload functionality.",
  "sources": "Package metadata via importlib.metadata, get_trame_versions() function, server reload function, dynamic HTML insertion, Vue bindings.",
  "sinks": "HTML content injection (footer, version info), dynamic attribute bindings (v_bind, v_on), event handlers for server reload, external URL links.",
  "flows": "Package info read and formatted into HTML; server reload triggered via button click; version info inserted into HTML; external links embedded in footer.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __properties in vuetify.VIcon with Vue internal properties, dynamic HTML insertion without sanitization, external URLs in footer links.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs UI layouts with standard patterns, fetching package version info and binding server actions. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The dynamic HTML content and external links are typical in UI code. The use of __properties in vuetify.VIcon is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard UI layout code for a Trame application, with benign dynamic content and external links. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The overall risk score is around 0.1-0.2, reflecting typical UI code with external links but no vulnerabilities.",
