  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some data processing or computation, but the exact intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, or external files; specific sources are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, but these are not clearly evident from the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or function inputs toward sinks like system commands or network calls, but no explicit flow is shown due to incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present in the visible code. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The review indicates standard code with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. Lack of context limits certainty, but based on available content, no malicious activity is detected. The code structure and usage seem typical for Python scripts performing data processing or API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears to be benign and follows standard practices.",
