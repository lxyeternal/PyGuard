  "purpose": "Define paths and configuration for serving Vue 2 frontend assets in a web server setup.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file path (__file__) and possibly the server's client_type attribute.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data output or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The Path(__file__).with_name('vue2-serve').resolve() reads the current file path; server.client_type is accessed conditionally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a filesystem path based on the current file location, likely for serving static assets. It defines a configuration dictionary for scripts and styles. The setup function verifies the server's client_type attribute, raising an error if it does not match 'vue2'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be standard configuration and validation logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration snippet for a web server, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
