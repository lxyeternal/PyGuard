  "purpose": "This code sets up paths and configuration for serving Vue 2 frontend assets in a web server environment.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).with_name('vue2-serve').resolve(), server.client_type attribute",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data directly; the code primarily manipulates file paths and performs a type check",
  "flows": "The file path is constructed from the script's location; server.client_type is read to determine client type; raises error if client type mismatch",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code; the use of Path for path resolution is standard; no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a file path based on the current file's directory, which is a common pattern for serving static assets. It then sets up some configuration dictionaries and a list of assets. The setup function checks the server's client_type attribute and raises an error if it does not match 'vue2'. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code performs straightforward path resolution and type validation without any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup snippet for a web server to serve Vue 2 assets, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
