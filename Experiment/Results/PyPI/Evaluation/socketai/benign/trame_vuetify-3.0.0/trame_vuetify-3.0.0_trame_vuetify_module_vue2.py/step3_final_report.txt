  "purpose": "Path and configuration setup for Vue 2 assets, including validation of server client type.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).with_name('vue2-serve').resolve()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; path resolution from __file__ is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Path construction from __file__ to serve_path; validation of server.client_type attribute.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a static path based on __file__, defines configuration variables, and validates server.client_type. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The path resolution is standard and safe unless __file__ is tampered with, which is outside normal scope. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The validation logic is simple and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard configuration and validation tasks with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor concern about __file__ is a standard pattern and does not constitute a security issue. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
