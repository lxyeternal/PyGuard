  "purpose": "Constructs UI layout components, retrieves package versions, manages server reloads, and displays version info and links.",
  "sources": "Package metadata via importlib.metadata, server controller, server state, static HTML strings, UI component constructors.",
  "sinks": "UI rendering, server reload triggers, version display, external links, server state modifications.",
  "flows": "Package info → get_trame_versions() → displayed in UI; server reload button → on_server_reload() → server controller; server state updates via self.server.state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward UI layout setup using standard libraries. get_trame_versions() enumerates installed packages without executing untrusted code. UI components are constructed with typical bindings and event handlers. No external network calls, credential leaks, or obfuscated patterns are present. Server interactions are limited to reload triggers and state updates, which are standard for such applications. The code is readable, well-structured, and purpose-driven for UI rendering.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for UI layout and version display in a Trame application. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate given the minimal security implications of the code.",
