  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the reported issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, data processing, or external interactions. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely a version string assignment, there's no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.0. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code's actual behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and match the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — The code is benign, with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — No security risks are present.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless version declaration. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.0                    |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.0                    |\n| Security Risk    | 0.0                    |\n\nThis matches the reports' assessments and aligns with best security practices.",
