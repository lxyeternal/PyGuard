  "purpose": "Declare the version of the Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '3.0.0' to the variable __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple, static version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment statement setting __version__ to '3.0.0'. It contains no input handling, no external data, no network activity, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. The code is minimal, standard practice in Python packaging, and free of suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with full confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
