  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no complex logic or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code only sets a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages for version tracking. There are no input sources, external communications, or potential sinks. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are present. The code is straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to declare the package version. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
