  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behaviors are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, standard, and free of suspicious constructs. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Risk Score Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree that the code is benign, the risk score should remain at 0. The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscation or hidden behaviors.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities**  \nNo assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of a version declaration. The code does not handle inputs, outputs, or external data, so no vulnerabilities are implied.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent and justified based on the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.**  \nNo changes are necessary to the scores or analysis.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, serving only to declare the version of the package. All reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the absence of any malicious or risky behavior.",
