{
  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package discovery using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and accesses '__path__' and '__name__' variables, which are typical in Python packages.",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "The code imports a standard library module and modifies '__path__' based on '__name__', with no untrusted data input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a common package extension operation with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' to modify '__path__' for package resource discovery, a standard pattern in Python packaging. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and the code’s purpose aligns with standard package initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical and safe package initialization statement used in Python packages. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
