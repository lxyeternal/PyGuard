  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ attribute to support namespace packages",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkgutil') function call, which imports the 'pkgutil' module",
  "sinks": "The assignment to __path__, which is a standard attribute for package modules",
  "flows": "The import of 'pkgutil', calling extend_path(__path__, __name__), and assigning back to __path__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a standard namespace package extension without unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module dynamically and uses its 'extend_path' function to modify the __path__ attribute, which is typical for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The pattern is standard for package extension and does not indicate malicious intent. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond the standard package extension process.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for extending namespace package paths and does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior.",
