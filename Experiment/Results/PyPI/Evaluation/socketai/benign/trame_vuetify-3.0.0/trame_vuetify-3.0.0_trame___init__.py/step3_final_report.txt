  "purpose": "Extend the __path__ attribute for namespace package support using pkgutil's extend_path method.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __path__ variable and dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks; the code only modifies the __path__ variable internally.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil', calls extend_path with __path__ and __name__, and assigns the result back to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string literal is slightly unusual but common in dynamic imports; no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern in Python for supporting namespace packages, involving dynamic import and extension of __path__. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious code are present. The use of __import__ is typical for dynamic module loading. The pattern is well-understood and safe. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1, confidence=0.9-1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for namespace package support in Python. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
