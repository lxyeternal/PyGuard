  "purpose": "Extend the module search path for package compatibility and distribution.",
  "sources": "Import statement: __import__(\"pkgutil\")",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or leak.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkgutil' used to extend __path__ without involving untrusted data; no data flow to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ to dynamically import 'pkgutil' is standard and not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the package's __path__ attribute using 'extend_path'. This pattern is common in namespace packages to support multiple distributions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import and extension are straightforward and use standard Python features. No unusual or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply extends the package path using standard Python practices, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
