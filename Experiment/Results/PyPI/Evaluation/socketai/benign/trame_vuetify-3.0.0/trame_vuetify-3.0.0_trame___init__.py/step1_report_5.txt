{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's __path__ to include additional locations, enabling namespace package behavior.",
  "sources": "__path__ and __name__ variables; the import of 'pkgutil' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and modifies the __path__ variable by extending it with additional locations for package resources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for supporting namespace packages; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses its 'extend_path' function to modify the __path__ attribute of a package, allowing it to be spread across multiple directories. This is a common pattern in Python namespace packages. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious data flows. The code does not read external input, perform network operations, or execute untrusted data. The only operation is the standard extension of the package path.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation for namespace package support and poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
