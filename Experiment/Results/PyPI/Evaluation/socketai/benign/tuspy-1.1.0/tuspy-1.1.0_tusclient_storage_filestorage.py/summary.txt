  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of local URL storage with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1–0.2), primarily due to potential risks associated with file-based storage if the database file is compromised. Overall, it is safe for use."
