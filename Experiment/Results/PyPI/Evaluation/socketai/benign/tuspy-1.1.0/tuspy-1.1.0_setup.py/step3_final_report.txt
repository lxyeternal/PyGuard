  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the Python library 'tuspy', defining dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing 'tusclient' for version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Importing 'tusclient' to retrieve version; reading 'README.md' to include long description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; reading 'README.md' without exception handling is typical but minor.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script with static dependencies and metadata. It does not contain any dynamic code, network calls, or untrusted data handling. The reading of 'README.md' is standard practice. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward and safe implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score of 0 or 0.1 is justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
