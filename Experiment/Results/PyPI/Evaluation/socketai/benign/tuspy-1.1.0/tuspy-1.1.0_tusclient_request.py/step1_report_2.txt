{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to perform HTTP requests for uploading files using the TUS protocol, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Reads file streams (`self.file`) and uploader configurations (`uploader`), including headers, URL, and verification settings.",
  "sinks": "Uses data in HTTP request bodies, headers (including checksum headers), and SSL context configurations for network communication.",
  "flows": "File data is read in chunks and sent via HTTP PATCH requests, with checksum headers added, and SSL contexts configured for secure communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; checksum calculation and SSL setup are standard. No obfuscated code, malicious URL usage, or data exfiltration observed. Use of exceptions is standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of file upload via the TUS protocol, supporting both sync and async methods. It reads files, computes optional checksums, and performs network requests with proper SSL context handling. The SSL setup adjusts based on provided client certificates. The request handling is standard and does not include suspicious or malicious behavior. No signs of backdoors, data theft, or covert communication channels are present. Usage of libraries like requests and aiohttp aligns with typical HTTP upload functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a TUS protocol uploader with standard security practices. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It handles network communications securely and appropriately manages errors. Overall, this code seems safe for use.",
