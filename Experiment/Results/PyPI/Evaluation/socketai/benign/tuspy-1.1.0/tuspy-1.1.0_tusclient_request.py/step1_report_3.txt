{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for handling HTTP requests related to uploading files using the TUS protocol, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'uploader' object to obtain URL, headers, file stream, and checksum parameters; reads file chunks during upload.",
  "sinks": "Makes network requests via requests.patch and aiohttp session.patch, potentially sending data read from the file stream; adds checksum headers to requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file.read() to network requests (requests.patch or aiohttp session.patch), with checksum calculation and headers added before transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; SSL context creation appears standard; no unusual or suspicious code behavior. Usage of exception handling for network errors is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code handles file uploads via TUS protocol, with both synchronous and asynchronous implementations. It uses standard libraries (requests, aiohttp) for network communication, with secure SSL context creation. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. Error handling is appropriate for network exceptions. There is no indication of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The logic is consistent with typical upload clients, and all data flows are predictable. No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a TUS upload client with proper error handling and secure network communication practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It seems to serve its intended purpose safely.",
