{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for handling HTTP/Tus upload requests, both synchronous and asynchronous, with error handling and checksum management.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from file streams via self.file.read() and uploader.get_headers(). It also reads exceptions from requests and aiohttp libraries.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via HTTP PATCH requests to specified URLs, potentially including checksum headers. It also processes and stores response data and headers.",
  "flows": "Input data from file streams (self.file.read()) flows into HTTP requests, with checksum headers added, and responses are processed and stored.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains minimal anomalous behavior; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident. The SSL context setup is standard, and error handling is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes HTTP requests with proper error handling, including retry or exception raising. It manages checksum headers securely, utilizing provided algorithms and base64 encoding. The async implementation creates SSL contexts with optional client certificates, following standard practices. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious network connections. All data handling appears consistent with standard upload procedures. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domains, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for uploading files via the Tus protocol, with appropriate error handling and security practices. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
