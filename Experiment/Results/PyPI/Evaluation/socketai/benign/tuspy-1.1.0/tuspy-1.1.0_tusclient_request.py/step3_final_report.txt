{
  "purpose": "Provides classes for synchronous and asynchronous file uploads via the TUS protocol, handling TLS, checksum, and error management.",
  "sources": "File stream read operations, request headers, and configuration attributes such as uploader URL, headers, and client certificates.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the specified upload URL, with potential data transmission including checksum headers.",
  "flows": "File stream reads data -> checksum calculation (if enabled) -> HTTP PATCH request with headers -> response handling.",
  "anomalies": "Minor issue in AsyncTusRequest.perform(): the check 'if (self.client_cert is str)' should be 'if isinstance(self.client_cert, str)'; deprecated 'loop' parameter in aiohttp.ClientSession used.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard secure upload procedures with proper TLS context setup, checksum headers, and error handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The only notable flaw is the incorrect type check for 'client_cert' which may affect certificate loading, and the use of a deprecated parameter in aiohttp. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with safe, legitimate code. No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a TUS file uploader with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain risks. The existing security scores are appropriate, with a minor technical correction recommended for robustness.",
