  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ as a simple version indicator.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a static assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a single assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version string assignment with no inputs, outputs, data processing, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving solely as a version indicator. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
