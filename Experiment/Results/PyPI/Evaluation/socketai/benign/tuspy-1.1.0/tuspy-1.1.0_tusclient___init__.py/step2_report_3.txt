  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code in detail.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"1.1.0\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n- No inputs, outputs, or data processing are involved.\n- No obfuscation, external calls, or complex logic are present.\n- The code is typical in Python packages for versioning.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, serving solely as a version indicator.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n\n**Common Points Across All Reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a simple version string assignment.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious activity are detected.\n- All reports assign a confidence level of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Errors or Flaws in the Reports:**\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in any of the reports. They are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Scores Analysis:**\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The malware score is 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 because the code is straightforward.\n- The security risk score is 0 because there's no potential vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The scores align with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' correctness, I concur with the assigned scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**My own estimate** aligns perfectly with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard version string assignment.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns.",
