  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or complex logic. This is consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   - The reports are accurate in their assessment that this code is benign and serves solely as a version indicator.  \n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent; the analysis correctly states that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.  \n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.  \n   - Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the absence of any suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment with no external interactions, no data processing, and no suspicious constructs, raising the security risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.  \n   - The current scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions such as network calls, data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscation.  \n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports correctly avoid speculative claims about vulnerabilities, focusing instead on the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Summary and final assessment:**  \n- The code is a minimal, standard version assignment.  \n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning above.",
