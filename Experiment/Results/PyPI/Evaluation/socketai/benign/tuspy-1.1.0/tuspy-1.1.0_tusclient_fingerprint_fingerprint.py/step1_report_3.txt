  "purpose": "Generate a fingerprint of a file stream using MD5 hash and file size for uniqueness.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the provided file stream (fs.read and fs.seek).",
  "sinks": "Uses hashlib.md5() to generate hash; returns formatted string with file size and hash.",
  "flows": "Reads data from fs, encodes it, updates hash, then reads file size, and outputs fingerprint string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses MD5 which is insecure for cryptographic purposes but acceptable here for fingerprinting. No external network communication, no data leakage, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads file data in chunks, encodes it, and hashes it with MD5 to generate a fingerprint, including file size to minimize collisions. The '_encode_data' method handles encoding, catching AttributeError if data is already binary. The code appears standard for fingerprinting and does not perform any malicious activity or insecure operations. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated logic are present. It relies solely on local file operations and standard library hashing functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of file fingerprinting with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It uses MD5 for hashing, which is acceptable for non-cryptographic purposes like fingerprinting, but not secure for cryptographic validation. Overall, it appears safe with no malicious behavior.",
