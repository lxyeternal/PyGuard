  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in Tus client communications and uploads.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and methods without reading external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks since no input/output operations occur.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The exception classes are straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code creates two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception and a specific error class. There are no external data reads, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears purely for error handling within a larger context. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious intent, no suspicious or malicious logic detected. It is standard error-handling code.",
