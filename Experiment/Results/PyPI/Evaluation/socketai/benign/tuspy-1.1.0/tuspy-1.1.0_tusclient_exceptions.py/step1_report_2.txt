{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors related to Tus protocol communication and upload failures.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the constructor parameters of the exception classes, particularly 'message', 'status_code', and 'response_content'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any sinks where untrusted data is used unsafely; exceptions are raised with messages but do not involve external systems directly.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the exception message construction and are stored as object attributes but are not processed further or used in dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The exception classes are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class. They are designed for error reporting in network communication and upload processes. There is no handling of untrusted data beyond storing provided parameters, and no external calls, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code is simple, with standard pattern usage, and contains no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. It poses no security threats, malware, or malicious behavior risks. The overall security profile is very low, and no anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
