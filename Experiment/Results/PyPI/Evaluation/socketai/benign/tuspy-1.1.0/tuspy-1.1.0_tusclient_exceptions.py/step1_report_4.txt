{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Tus server communication and upload failures.",
  "sources": "Constructor argument 'status_code' used to generate default message",
  "sinks": "Super class __init__ method (super(TusCommunicationError, self).__init__(message)) which may influence exception handling",
  "flows": "Input arguments 'message', 'status_code', 'response_content' flow into the constructor, affecting exception message and attributes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or malicious constructs; use of exception classes and string formatting is standard",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. TusCommunicationError constructs detailed error messages based on input parameters, particularly 'status_code'. The implementation uses standard practices with no indications of malicious behavior or hidden payloads. The code's purpose is to enhance error handling clarity. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The class structure and logic are straightforward, focusing solely on exception reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides well-structured custom exceptions for error handling without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is standard, safe, and does not pose security risks.",
