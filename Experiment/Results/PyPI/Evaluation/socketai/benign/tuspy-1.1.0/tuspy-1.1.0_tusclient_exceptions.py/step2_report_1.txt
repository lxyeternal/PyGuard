  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code defines two custom exception classes: `TusCommunicationError` and `TusUploadFailed`.\n   - The classes are straightforward, inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - The constructor in `TusCommunicationError` constructs a default message if none is provided, incorporating the `status_code`.\n   - No external data handling, network operations, or data processing occurs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Security Risks**:\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks.\n   - The code is standard exception class definitions with no complex logic or external dependencies.\n   - The `malware` score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - The `securityRisk` score is also 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - The `malware` score of 0 is appropriate given the analysis.\n   - The `obfuscated` score of 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n   - The `securityRisk` score of 0 aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n4. **Potential for Misinterpretation or Assumptions**:\n   - Some reports mention the use of input parameters and their storage as attributes, but this does not introduce any security issues.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code analysis, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n   - The conclusion that the code is safe, standard, and poses no security risk is well justified.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at 0.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, standard class definitions)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, standard, and secure. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should not be adjusted.",
