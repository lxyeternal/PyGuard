  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception.\n- There are no external data sources, network calls, or data processing.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The logic is straightforward, standard for error handling.\n- All reports agree on the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- It is purely for defining exception classes with no input parsing or data handling.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- There are **no logical errors or flaws** in the code.\n- The constructor correctly constructs default messages and assigns attributes.\n- The inheritance structure is standard and appropriate.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is accurate. No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The code is a minimal, standard implementation of exception classes.\n- No external data, network activity, or processing that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- No signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n### Potential inconsistencies:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the comprehensive review, I concur with the reports' conclusions:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are accurate, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
