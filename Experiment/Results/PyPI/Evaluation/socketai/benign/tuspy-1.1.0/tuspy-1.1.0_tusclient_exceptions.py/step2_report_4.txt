  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code consists solely of three exception class definitions: `TusCommunicationError`, `TusUploadFailed`, and their inheritance structure.\n- No external data, network operations, or data processing are present.\n- The classes are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, safe, and contains no malicious behavior. This aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The reports do not identify any logical errors or security flaws, which is accurate given the code's nature.\n\n**3. Scores given to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These seem appropriate because the code is simple, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is justified.\n- No reason exists to elevate the risk score because the code does not perform any network, data handling, or dynamic operations.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- The code does not include any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or backdoors.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's straightforward nature.\n- No unwarranted security concerns are inferred.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or payload.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — no security risk detected.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes for error handling.\n- There are no signs of supply chain risks, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is benign, safe, and standard.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| malware        | 0               |\n| obfuscated     | 0               |\n| securityRisk   | 0               |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
