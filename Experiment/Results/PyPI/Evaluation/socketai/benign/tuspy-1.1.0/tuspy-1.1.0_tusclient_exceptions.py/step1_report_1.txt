{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to communication and upload failures with a tus server.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code defines classes and methods without input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data or could leak information.",
  "flows": "The code does not process or transfer data; it only sets up exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class, intended for error handling in a tus server client context. The constructor assigns message, status_code, and response_content attributes. There are no input parsing, network connections, or data handling operations, nor any suspicious or malicious constructs. The code appears standard, with clear, well-structured exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code is safe and straightforward.",
