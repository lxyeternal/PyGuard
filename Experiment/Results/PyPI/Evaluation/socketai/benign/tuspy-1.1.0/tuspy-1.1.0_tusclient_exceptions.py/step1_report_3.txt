  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Tus client communication and upload failures.",
  "sources": "None, as the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None, as the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. The first class, TusCommunicationError, is designed to encapsulate errors during communication with a Tus server, including optional attributes for status code and response content. The constructor constructs a default error message if none is provided, incorporating the status code. The second class, TusUploadFailed, extends TusCommunicationError but does not add additional behavior or attributes. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve a clear purpose for error handling and is structurally normal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Tus client context. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. It is safe and unrelated to supply chain security risks.",
