  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes for error handling.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or data processing are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review:**\n\n#### **Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the description: simple exception class definitions.\n- No errors, flaws, or malicious code are present.\n- The logic is sound and typical for Python exception classes.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent, accurate, and comprehensive.\n- They correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** No mistakes or flaws in the reports.\n\n---\n\n#### **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the straightforward, safe nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- The highest scores are 0, indicating no security concern.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data handling, or contain any malicious payloads.\n- The exception classes are purely for error reporting.\n\n**Conclusion:** No risk scores > 0.5 are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Malware score considerations:**\n- Since no malicious behavior, payloads, or obfuscated code are present, malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The code cannot be malicious in its current form.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n- They correctly state that the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n---\n\n#### **Score consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No anomalies or inconsistencies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Based on all reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
