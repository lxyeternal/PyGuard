  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines two custom exception classes:\n  - `TusCommunicationError`: for errors during communication with a tus server, with optional attributes `status_code` and `response_content`. Its constructor generates a default message if none is provided.\n  - `TusUploadFailed`: inherits from `TusCommunicationError`, used when an upload fails.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data handling, network operations, or complex logic.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present\n- The code does not contain vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious logic.\n- The exception classes are standard, with no input parsing beyond constructor parameters.\n- No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- The logic is simple and clear.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with no data processing.\n- No inaccuracies or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned to each report\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external interactions, the risk score should remain very low.\n- The highest risk could be related to misconfiguration or misuse, but not inherent in the code itself.\n- No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities justify raising the risk score.\n\n**Conclusion:** The risk score should stay at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Malware score justification\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as code execution, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- No suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score is correctly assigned as 0.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's straightforward nature.\n- No claims of potential vulnerabilities are made, only that the code is standard and safe.\n\n**No challenge needed here.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Consistency of scores\n- All scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n- No anomalies or inconsistencies detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is simple, standard, and contains no malicious or risky elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security threats. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
