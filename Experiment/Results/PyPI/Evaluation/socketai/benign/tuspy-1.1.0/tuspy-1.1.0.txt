The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1–0.2), primarily due to potential risks associated with file-based storage if the database file is compromised. Overall, it is safe for use."

The primary concern is the use of MD5, which is insecure for cryptographic purposes but acceptable here for non-security-critical identification. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
