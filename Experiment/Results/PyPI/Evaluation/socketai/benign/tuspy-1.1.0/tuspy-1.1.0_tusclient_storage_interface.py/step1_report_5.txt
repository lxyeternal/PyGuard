{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for URL storage operations such as get, set, and remove.",
  "sources": "Input data includes method parameters: 'key' and 'value' (both strings).",
  "sinks": "Method implementations are abstract; potential data sinks depend on concrete subclasses. No direct sinks in this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'key' and 'value' flow into abstract methods; actual data flow depends on subclasses implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with three methods for URL storage management. It uses standard Python features like abc.ABCMeta and abstract methods, with clear docstrings. There are no data handling, network operations, or logic beyond interface definition. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple, standard interface definition for URL storage, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It provides a clean abstraction for subclasses to implement storage mechanisms.",
