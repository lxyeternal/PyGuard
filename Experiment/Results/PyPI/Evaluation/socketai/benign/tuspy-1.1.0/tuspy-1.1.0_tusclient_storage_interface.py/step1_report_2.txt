{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for URL storage operations.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the method parameters (key, value) provided during method calls.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or outputted by the code itself.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve input parameters (key, value) used in storage operations, but these are abstract method definitions with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and only declares an interface with no implementation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple abstract base class defining methods for getting, setting, and removing items in storage, with descriptive docstrings. It does not contain executable logic or external data interactions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. Usage of abc and class declaration are standard. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign interface definition for URL storage operations with no malicious or security risks. It functions as an abstract API contract without implementation, so no security concerns are apparent.",
