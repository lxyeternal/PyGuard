  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for URL storage operations, including methods to get, set, and remove items identified by keys.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code defines abstract methods without implementation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; as an interface, it declares method signatures without execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, using standard Python abc module for interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard abstract base class with three abstract methods for URL storage management. It uses Python's abc module correctly, with clear docstrings. There are no embedded data, external interactions, or suspicious constructs. The code serves as a contract for subclasses to implement storage logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, non-executable nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard interface with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores assigned are accurate, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
