{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit documentation indicating a malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined; the code reads data from function arguments, environment variables, and possibly external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, and environment variable access, but none are directly present or clearly malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (function arguments, environment variables) through processing functions, but no untrusted data is shown to reach sensitive sinks such as network or file systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are evident. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python libraries and functions. No suspicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious API calls are detected. The structure suggests legitimate utility functions without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no suspicious anomalies.",
