  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform some form of data processing or network activity, but without context, its intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, imported modules, and any user input functions present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or data exfiltration points, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. However, lack of comments and unclear logic may be a concern.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed step-by-step: starting from import statements, examining data input points, assessing data handling and processing logic, and identifying output or network communication points. No suspicious patterns or malicious code segments are identified. The code structure appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Without specific details on imported modules or runtime behaviors, the evaluation is based solely on static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit clear malicious behavior or security risks based on the static review. It appears to be legitimate, but the lack of context and comments warrants cautious deployment. No malware or obfuscation is detected. Overall security risk is low.",
