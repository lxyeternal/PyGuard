  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network/file sinks, function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), possibly via functions or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate absence of code or malicious indicators, with scores reflecting high confidence in benign assessment. Malware scores are zero, obfuscation absent, and security risks are low (0.1-0.2). Slightly higher security risk in some reports (0.2) is justified but could be marginally lowered for caution. The reasoning is consistent and appropriate given the limited code context.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, with low security risks. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
