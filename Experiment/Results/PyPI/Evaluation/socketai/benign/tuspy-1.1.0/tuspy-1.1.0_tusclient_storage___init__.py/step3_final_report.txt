  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and potential malicious behavior of the provided Python dependency code.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network calls, file operations, data processing functions",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data outputs",
  "flows": "Input reading → processing → output or network transmission",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, unusual data exfiltration patterns, obfuscated code segments",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for source points such as input functions and environment variable reads. Sinks like network connections and file writes were identified. Flows from sources to sinks were mapped to detect potential data leaks or malicious actions. Anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity were noted. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns were found. The code structure appeared standard, with no suspicious behaviors detected. The overall assessment indicates the code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities based on the analysis. It appears to be a standard, benign dependency with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
