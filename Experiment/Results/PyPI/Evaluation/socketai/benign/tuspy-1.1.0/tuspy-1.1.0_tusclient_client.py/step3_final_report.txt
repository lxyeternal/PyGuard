  "purpose": "A straightforward wrapper class for the tus client, managing configuration parameters such as URL, headers, and client certificates, and providing methods to instantiate uploaders.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (url, headers, client_cert), set_headers method input",
  "sinks": "Uploader and AsyncUploader class instantiations, which may handle file uploads",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes, then into external uploader classes; set_headers updates headers dict",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution; external classes assumed benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured client wrapper that manages configuration for a tus upload client. It does not perform any network activity or data handling directly, aside from passing configuration to external classes. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The data flow is straightforward, with configuration parameters set during initialization or via methods, and then used to instantiate uploaders. External dependencies are standard and assumed safe. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The configuration options are typical for such a client wrapper. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal configuration-related risks. The reports' assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
