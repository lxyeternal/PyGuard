  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward wrapper for a tus client, handling configuration, headers, and instantiating uploaders.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- External classes (Uploader, AsyncUploader) are imported from a known library, assumed benign.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- The only potential concern is misuse of headers or client_cert, but this is inherent to such clients and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes potential sinks in uploader classes, but no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Reasonable; code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2.  \n  The security risk is low, considering misconfiguration or misuse, but no direct vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward nature.\n- Correctly identifies potential sinks but finds no malicious intent.\n- Confidence is high; scores are low.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Highlights the potential for untrusted data in args/kwargs, but clarifies that the code itself is benign.\n- No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- The security risk is minimal, considering the possibility of user misconfiguration.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Emphasizes the standard nature of the code.\n- No suspicious patterns or anomalies.\n- The security risk is low, mainly related to configuration errors rather than malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores align.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Similar assessment: the code is a typical client wrapper.\n- No signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- Potential for misuse is acknowledged but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential for misconfiguration or misuse, but no inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, mainly due to potential misconfiguration, not code flaws)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is benign, with scores reflecting minor risks associated with configuration rather than security flaws. No adjustments needed.",
