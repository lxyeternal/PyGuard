{
  "purpose": "Defines a TusClient class for managing uploads to a tus server, including configuration and uploader instantiation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include constructor parameters (url, headers, client_cert), method arguments (headers), and internal attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the creation of Uploader and AsyncUploader instances, and the update of headers which could be used in requests.",
  "flows": "Headers set via set_headers or constructor flow into HTTP requests made by the uploaders. Uploader instances are created with the client context, which could influence request headers or certificates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around the tusclient library, providing configuration and uploader factory methods. It manages server URL, headers, and client certificates. All data flows appear standard, with no indication of malicious intent. The methods perform expected actions such as updating headers and creating uploader instances. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical client wrapper for tus protocol uploads with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It handles configuration and instantiates uploaders securely. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present.",
