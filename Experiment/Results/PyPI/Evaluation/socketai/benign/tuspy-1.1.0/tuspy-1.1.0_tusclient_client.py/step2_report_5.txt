  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward client wrapper for the tus protocol, providing configuration options and methods to create uploaders.\n- It handles user-supplied parameters (headers, client_cert) securely and passively.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The external classes (Uploader, AsyncUploader) are imported from a known library, with no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks directly.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Accurate, describes the code well.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identified.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — possibly slightly high but considering the potential for headers or certs to be misused, acceptable.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, with slightly higher confidence.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — justified, as no risky behavior is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Similar reasoning applies.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0 — aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Slightly lower security risk score (0.1), which is acceptable.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Similar to others, consistent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — slightly higher but still reasonable given the context.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- The only potential concern is the handling of headers and client certificates, which could be misused if supplied maliciously, but this is standard and expected for such a client.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 — slightly elevated due to the nature of configurable parameters but still low.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malware or malicious behavior present.                   |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is clear, no obfuscation detected.                     |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1               | Slightly elevated due to configurable headers/certs, but standard. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
