{
  "purpose": "The code defines a TusClient class for interacting with a tus server for resumable uploads, including setting headers and creating uploader objects.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (url, headers, client_cert), set_headers method, uploader and async_uploader methods",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the uploader and async_uploader methods could send data or execute code based on parameters; set_headers updates headers which could include malicious or sensitive data",
  "flows": "Input data from constructor or set_headers → stored in class attributes → used in uploader creation or requests",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No evidence of malicious network activity, code injection, or privacy leaks. Usage of external library classes (Uploader, AsyncUploader) is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a client for the tus protocol, with methods to set headers and create uploader instances. It relies on external libraries for upload functionality. No input/output data flows appear malicious, nor is there evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent. The only potential concern is if the headers or client_cert contain sensitive information, but this is expected behavior for such a client. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of a tus client interface without any malicious or maliciously intended features. No malware, security risks, or anomalies are evident.",
