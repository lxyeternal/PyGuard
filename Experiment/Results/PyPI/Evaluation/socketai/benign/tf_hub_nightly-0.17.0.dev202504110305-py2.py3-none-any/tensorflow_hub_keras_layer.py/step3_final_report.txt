{
  "purpose": "A Keras Layer for using TF Hub modules in TF2 format, wrapping a SavedModel or legacy TF1 Hub model for integration into Keras workflows.",
  "sources": "The handle parameter (string or callable) used to load the model; internal loading functions; inputs provided to the call() method.",
  "sinks": "Outputs from the loaded module during call(); configuration data during get_config(); internal model loading functions.",
  "flows": "Input tensors flow into the wrapped module via the call() method; model handle resolves during initialization; configuration data flows during serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, network activity, or hidden behaviors; code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard APIs; no obfuscation or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard pattern for wrapping TensorFlow Hub modules as Keras layers, with careful handling of different TF versions, signatures, and serialization. It loads models via established APIs, manages trainability, and supports configuration serialization. No malicious behaviors, external communications, or obfuscation are present. The code adheres to best practices for model wrapping and serialization, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented wrapper for TensorFlow Hub modules, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The supply chain security posture is strong, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
