  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for resolving, downloading, caching, and managing TensorFlow Hub modules, with environment variables and flags controlling cache directory, download format, and SSL validation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, flags, network URLs, filesystem reads (lock files, descriptor files), SSL contexts.",
  "sinks": "Network requests for module download, filesystem writes for cache and descriptor files, lock file creation/removal, progress logging.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, URLs) influence SSL context and cache management; network download flows through SSL context; lock files coordinate concurrent downloads; descriptor files record module info.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of environment variable-controlled SSL validation disable, which can be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks if environment is untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for module resolution, download management, cache handling, and concurrency control via lock files. No malicious routines, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only security concern is the optional disabling of SSL certificate validation via environment variable, which could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated maliciously. The code structure is clear, and the logic is consistent with typical download and cache management practices. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is absent. The risk score is moderate (around 0.2-0.3), primarily due to the SSL validation toggle, which should be used cautiously in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility infrastructure for managing TensorFlow Hub modules. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the optional SSL validation disable feature, which could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously set. Overall, the scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
