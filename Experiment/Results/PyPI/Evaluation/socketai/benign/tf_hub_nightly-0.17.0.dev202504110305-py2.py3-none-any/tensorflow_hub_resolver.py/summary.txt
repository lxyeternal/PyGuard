  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility infrastructure for managing TensorFlow Hub modules. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the optional SSL validation disable feature, which could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously set. Overall, the scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
