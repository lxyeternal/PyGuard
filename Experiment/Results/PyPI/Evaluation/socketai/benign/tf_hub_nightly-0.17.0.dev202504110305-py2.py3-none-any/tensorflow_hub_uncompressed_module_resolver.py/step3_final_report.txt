  "purpose": "Resolve TensorFlow Hub modules stored in uncompressed format on GCS by requesting and validating their locations via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input handle URL, network response containing GCS location",
  "sinks": "Response body containing GCS URI, passing URI to PathResolver",
  "flows": "Handle URL -> HTTP request with parameters -> Server response -> Validation of response -> Extracted GCS URI passed to PathResolver",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; standard URL request and response validation",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard URL resolution for TensorFlow Hub modules stored on GCS. It constructs requests with specific query parameters, expects a 303 redirect, and reads the response body to obtain the GCS location. Proper validation ensures the response starts with 'gs://', and errors are raised for unexpected response codes. No malicious or suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or credential leaks are present. The network interactions are typical for such resource resolvers. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's straightforward, safe implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a resource resolver with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk scores are justified, and the code performs expected URL resolution tasks without issues.",
