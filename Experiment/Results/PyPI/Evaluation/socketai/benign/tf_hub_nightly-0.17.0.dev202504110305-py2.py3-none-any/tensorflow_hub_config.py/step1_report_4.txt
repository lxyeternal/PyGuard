  "purpose": "The code configures and registers different resolver implementations for TensorFlow Hub to handle various module sources.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow_hub and the function _install_default_resolvers() which creates resolver instances.",
  "sinks": "add_implementation method of registry.resolver, which registers resolver instances.",
  "flows": "Resolvers instantiated in _install_default_resolvers() are added to the registry via add_implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific resolver modules from tensorflow_hub, then defines a function that instantiates various resolver classes and registers them. The resolvers handle different source types for modules (local files, GCS, HTTP). The functions _run() and _get_extra_deps() do not process untrusted input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and uses standard APIs without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration script for registering resolvers in TensorFlow Hub. No malicious behavior, no suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a legitimate setup for module source management.",
