  "purpose": "Configure and register resolvers for TensorFlow Hub API.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow_hub, creation of resolver instances in _install_default_resolvers.",
  "sinks": "add_implementation method of registry.resolver, which registers resolver instances.",
  "flows": "Imports → creation of resolver objects → registry.resolver.add_implementation calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution or external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules from tensorflow_hub and creates instances of resolver classes, then registers them with a registry. No user input handling, no data leakage, no network operations or file manipulations outside of expected resolver registration. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code appears to be standard configuration for the TensorFlow Hub library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration script for registering resolver implementations within the TensorFlow Hub library. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
