  "purpose": "Configure and register resolvers for TensorFlow Hub API implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow_hub and the _install_default_resolvers() function that creates resolver instances.",
  "funnels": "Adding resolver implementations to the registry via registry.resolver.add_implementation.",
  "flows": "Resolver instances created in _install_default_resolvers() are added to the registry, with no data flow from external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code constructs; the code primarily sets up resolver objects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from tensorflow_hub and defines functions to install default resolvers. The resolvers are instantiated using standard class constructors from tensorflow_hub and added to a registry. No untrusted input handling, no network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be straightforward configuration code with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for TensorFlow Hub resolvers, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It performs normal registration of components required for the API operation.",
