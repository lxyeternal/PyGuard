  "purpose": "Configure and register different module resolvers for TensorFlow Hub API.",
  "sources": "Imports from tensorflow_hub library; method _install_default_resolvers() which creates resolver objects.",
  "sinks": "add_implementation method of registry.resolver, which registers resolver objects.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Creation of resolver instances -> Registration via add_implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious imports. The code is straightforward configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules from tensorflow_hub, defines functions to install default resolvers, and registers resolver implementations. It uses standard class instantiations and method calls with no user input, network activity, or external data sources involved. The code is clean, follows typical patterns for plugin registration, and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration script for setting up resolvers in TensorFlow Hub. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent. The code appears safe and purely functional for its purpose.",
