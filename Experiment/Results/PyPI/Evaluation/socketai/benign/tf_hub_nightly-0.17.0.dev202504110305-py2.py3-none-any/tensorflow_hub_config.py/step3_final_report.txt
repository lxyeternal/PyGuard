  "sources": "Instantiation of resolver classes: resolver.PathResolver(), uncompressed_module_resolver.HttpUncompressedFileResolver(), compressed_module_resolver.GcsCompressedFileResolver(), compressed_module_resolver.HttpCompressedFileResolver().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only registers internal resolver instances without external data flow.",
  "flows": "Creation of resolver objects → registration via registry.resolver.add_implementation()",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for registering resolver classes within TensorFlow Hub. It imports trusted modules, creates resolver instances, and registers them without involving external input, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The functions are simple and deterministic, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Minor overestimations of risk (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable but could be set to zero for precision.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration script for resolver registration with no malicious activity or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
