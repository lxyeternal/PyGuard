  "sources": "File reading via tf.compat.v1.gfile.GFile, directory existence checks, os.path.split, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; filesystem operations are local.",
  "flows": "Reading files, writing files atomically, creating timestamped directories, cleaning old exports, and tensor type inspections.",
  "anomalies": "Minor bug in get_timestamped_export_dir: incorrect string formatting in RuntimeError; should use '%d' % MAX_DIRECTORY_CREATION_ATTEMPTS instead of '.MAX_DIRECTORY_CREATION_ATTEMPTS'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of standard filesystem and tensor utilities with safe patterns like UUIDs, retries, and atomic writes. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity is present. The only flaw is a minor formatting bug in an exception message, which could cause a runtime error but not security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with filesystem operations. The overall design is straightforward and aligns with typical TensorFlow export workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and safe for use. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only recommended fix is correcting the string formatting bug in get_timestamped_export_dir. The low security risk and malware scores are justified.",
