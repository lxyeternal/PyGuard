  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for file handling, directory management, and tensor operations within TensorFlow, mainly for model export and file I/O.",
  "sources": "Reads file contents via read_file_to_string; reads directory contents via tf.compat.v1.gfile.ListDirectory; checks file existence and deletes via tf.compat.v1.gfile.Exists and tf.compat.v1.gfile.DeleteRecursively; reads environment variables in absolute_path; generates temporary directories based on input paths.",
  "sinks": "Writes to files via tf.compat.v1.gfile.GFile and atomic write; renames temporary files to target filenames; deletes directories; logs warnings and errors; accesses environment info in absolute_path.",
  "flows": "File contents are read via read_file_to_string; directory existence is checked before creation; temporary files are created and renamed to ensure atomic writes; directories are timestamped and managed for versioning; tensor-related functions process composite tensor type specs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses uuid for temp filename generation, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network communication, reverse shells, or data exfiltration observed; no obfuscated code present; no suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for file and directory management, tensor processing, and version control within TensorFlow workflows. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. Use of uuid and timestamping for directory uniqueness is normal. No external network calls, hidden code, or credential handling are present. The imports are standard, with conditional handling of TensorFlow internal modules. The logging warns about directory name collisions, which is expected in such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a set of utility functions for managing files, directories, and tensor type specs within TensorFlow projects. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code appears safe and aligned with typical TensorFlow utility patterns.",
