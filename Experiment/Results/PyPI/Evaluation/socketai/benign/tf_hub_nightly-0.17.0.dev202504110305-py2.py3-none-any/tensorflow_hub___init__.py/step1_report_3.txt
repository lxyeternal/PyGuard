{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and configures the TensorFlow Hub library, ensuring compatible versions of Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, and exposing specific functions and modules for use.",
  "sources": "Import statements for tensorflow, tensorflow_hub modules, and version variables. Version checks and error handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for error messages. Imports and module exports. Version validation functions.",
  "flows": "Version check functions validate environment and dependencies at startup, raising exceptions if conditions are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code; standard dependency checks and import routines. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment validation, dependency verification, and module exposure for tensorflow_hub. It checks Python version, tensorflow version, and keras compatibility with detailed error messages. No untrusted data sources or external network communications are involved. The logic is straightforward and typical for a setup/initialization script. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. All code appears standard for a dependency management module, with proper exception handling and version validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment setup and dependency verification script for tensorflow_hub. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs necessary checks to ensure proper runtime conditions without suspicious activity.",
