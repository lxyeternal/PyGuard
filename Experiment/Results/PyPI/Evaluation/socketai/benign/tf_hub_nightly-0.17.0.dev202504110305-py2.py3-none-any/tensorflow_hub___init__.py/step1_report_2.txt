{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to ensure environment compatibility for the TensorFlow Hub library, including verifying Python and TensorFlow versions, and importing necessary modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables for version checks and imports modules such as sys, tensorflow, and pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data; the code does not process external inputs that could lead to vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves environment validation steps and module imports without passing untrusted data between sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs environment checks and conditional imports but does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily focuses on environment validation, version checks, and module imports to prepare the TensorFlow Hub environment. It includes functions to verify Python and TensorFlow versions and ensure compatibility with Keras. All operations are standard environment setup routines. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or supply chain attacks are evident. The code adheres to typical development practices for environment validation and module management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment setup script for TensorFlow Hub with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs version checks and imports required modules without processing untrusted inputs or executing suspicious operations.",
