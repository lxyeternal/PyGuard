{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and verifies environment dependencies for the TensorFlow Hub library, including Python version, TensorFlow installation, and Keras compatibility, then exposes specific API functions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys, tensorflow as tf, pkg_resources.parse_version, tf.keras, internal imports (tensorflow_hub.keras_layer, module_v2, version, config)",
  "sinks": "Potential import errors or version checks could be triggered, but no data sinks or sensitive data outputs are present",
  "flows": "Environment checks (Python version, tensorflow import, keras import) -> conditional imports and version validation -> exposing API functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The code performs standard environment validation and module importation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment validation for Python, TensorFlow, and Keras versions, raising informative ImportError messages if requirements are not met. It imports specific modules from tensorflow_hub and exposes selected symbols. The environment checks and import procedures are standard and do not contain suspicious behavior or malicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment setup and dependency verification script for TensorFlow Hub. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or supply chain attacks, and the structure is straightforward and typical for such libraries.",
