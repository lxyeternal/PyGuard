{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and verifies environment compatibility for TensorFlow Hub, ensuring correct versions of Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, and imports necessary modules for TensorFlow Hub functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (Python version, TensorFlow version), attempts to import external libraries (tensorflow, tf_keras).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code mainly performs environment checks and imports.",
  "flows": "System information flows from the environment to version checks; imported modules are used for functionality but do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; version checks and import validations are standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment validation: it checks Python version, imports TensorFlow, verifies its version, attempts to import tf_keras if TensorFlow version is 3.x, and imports core TensorFlow Hub components. All actions are standard setup procedures. No external data inputs, user data, or untrusted sources are handled. The code does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or dynamic code execution beyond imports. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for TensorFlow Hub with environment validation and module imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It is safe and intended for environment preparation.",
