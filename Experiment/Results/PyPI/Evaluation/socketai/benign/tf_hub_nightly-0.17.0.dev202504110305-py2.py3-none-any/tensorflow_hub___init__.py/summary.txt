  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for TensorFlow Hub, performing environment validation and module exposure. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (0.1) assigned in reports is justified by its routine nature, and malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero."
