  "purpose": "Environment validation and dependency checks for Python, TensorFlow, and Keras; module exposure.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, tensorflow, pkg_resources, and environment variables for version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; purely environment validation.",
  "flows": "Version checks and module imports without data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dependency validation and environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment validation routines: checks Python version, TensorFlow installation and version, and Keras compatibility. It imports necessary modules and exposes specific functions. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The logic is clear, with exception handling for import errors. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for TensorFlow Hub, performing environment validation and module exposure. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score (0.1) assigned in reports is justified by its routine nature, and malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero.",
