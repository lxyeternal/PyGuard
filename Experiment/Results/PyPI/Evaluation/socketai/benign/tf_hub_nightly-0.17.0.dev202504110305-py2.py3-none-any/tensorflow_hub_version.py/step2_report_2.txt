  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable (`__version__ = \"0.17.0.dev\"`).\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input handling, external data sources, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is boilerplate, license comments, and a simple variable assignment, which is standard practice for package metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are present in the reports. They are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, which is correct.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of malicious intent based solely on the code snippet.\n   - No external dependencies or dynamic code are involved that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and standard practice.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — The code contains no malicious elements.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the reports' assessments. There are no hidden threats or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard, harmless version string declaration with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
