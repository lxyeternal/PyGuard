  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the TensorFlow Hub package.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable from a string literal.",
  "sinks": "Assignment operation; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, simple, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains licensing comments and a single line assigning a version string to a variable. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no dynamic code execution. The license comments are standard boilerplate and do not affect security. The version string appears static and hardcoded, with no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign declaration of a version string with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
