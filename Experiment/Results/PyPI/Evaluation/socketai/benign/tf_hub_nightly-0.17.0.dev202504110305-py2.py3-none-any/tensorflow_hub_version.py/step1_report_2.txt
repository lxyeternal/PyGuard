  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a string variable __version__ with a version number. There are no inputs, no external data reads, and no execution of untrusted code or dynamic evaluation. The code is standard metadata definition for a Python package. There are no suspicious or malicious elements present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
