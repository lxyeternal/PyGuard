  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or obfuscation:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, no input sources, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no obfuscation.\n   - The code is boilerplate, standard metadata, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign and contains no malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The reasoning that this is standard, static, and safe code is sound.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious elements.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence suggests any risk; the code is purely metadata.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions are made about malicious intent; the code is clearly benign.\n   - The reports correctly avoid speculative claims about vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a simple, static assignment of a version string, typical for Python package metadata. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
