  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the details.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static assignment of a version string to a variable (`__version__`).\n- No input sources, data processing, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code is standard boilerplate for Python package versioning.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external interactions are detected.\n\n**Specific Analysis per report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines version string.\n- Source: Assignment of string literal.\n- Flows: No untrusted data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, consistent.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion.\n- No issues.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, static declaration of a version string.\n- No input handling, data flow, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware.\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware score: 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, code is straightforward and readable.\n- Risk score: 0, no security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, standard metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the true nature of the code.",
