  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package as a static variable.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string literal '__version__ = \"0.17.0.dev\"'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; static assignment is self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with standard boilerplate comments and a simple variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a single line assigning a version string to the '__version__' variable. There are no dynamic elements, input handling, external data sources, or code execution. The code is typical for package metadata and does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, static version string declaration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
