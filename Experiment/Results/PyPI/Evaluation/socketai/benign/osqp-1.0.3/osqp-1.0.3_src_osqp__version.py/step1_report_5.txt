  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, including version string and tuple.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version assignment with type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version metadata for a Python package. It includes type checking conditional code, but all actual assignments are static strings and tuples. No external input, no data leaks, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior are present. It follows common versioning patterns generated by setuptools-scm. The structure is standard, with no suspicious or hidden operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard versioning boilerplate, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
