  "flows": "The code assigns static version values to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, sets type hints, and assigns static version strings and tuples. It includes type checking blocks but no dynamic or external data handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, static version declaration module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
