  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and version tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment of version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version variables and assigns fixed version strings and tuples. It includes type checking conditional, but no dynamic or untrusted input handling. No external data sources, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. The code is a typical version module generated by setuptools-scm, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version information module with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply defines version variables for the package.",
