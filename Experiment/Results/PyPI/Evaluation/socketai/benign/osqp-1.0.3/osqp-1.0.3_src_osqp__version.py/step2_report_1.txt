  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward static version declaration, generated by setuptools-scm. It assigns hardcoded version strings and tuples, includes type hints, and contains no dynamic or external data handling. All reports agree that the code is benign and standard for version management.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is static, auto-generated, and free of malicious patterns. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Malware: 0  \n   - SecurityRisk: 0  \n   - Confidence: 1.0\n\n   These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is static, contains no external input, network activity, or code injection, there's no basis for assigning higher malware or security risk scores. The code does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and rely on the static, straightforward nature of the code. No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. All reports agree on zero malware and obfuscation, with full confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a simple, static version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are thorough and correct. The code is benign, and the scoring aligns with the analysis. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
