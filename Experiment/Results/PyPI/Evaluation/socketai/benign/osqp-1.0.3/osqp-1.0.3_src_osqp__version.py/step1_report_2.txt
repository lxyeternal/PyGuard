{
  "purpose": "Define version information and types for the package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No external input sources; only internal assignment of version data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors present. The code is straightforward and standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes version metadata using static assignment. It imports typing for type hints within a TYPE_CHECKING block, which is a common pattern. No user input, network, or file IO occurs. The version string and tuple are hardcoded, which is typical for release versions. No suspicious or malicious activity detected. The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated version definition module with no malicious or security concerns. It merely assigns static version information with no external interactions.",
