  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and sets version variables.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains only static version data.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares version variables and assigns static version data. The '__version__' and related variables are hardcoded with version '1.0.3'. There are no input, output, or external data operations. The structure includes conditional typing checks which are standard for type hinting and do not introduce security issues. No suspicious or malicious code is present, and the code’s purpose is purely for version information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
