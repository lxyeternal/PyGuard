  "purpose": "Static version declaration generated by setuptools-scm, used for version management in Python packages.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string and tuple assignments, type checking block (TYPE_CHECKING).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated module defining version variables with hardcoded values. It includes type hints and a conditional type checking block, but no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign boilerplate code with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is 0, with full confidence. The code's purpose is purely informational, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and standard for version management. All reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the safe nature of the code. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
