  "purpose": "Extend the OSQP interface to enforce the use of the 'mkl' algebra option upon initialization.",
  "sources": "Importing OSQP class from osqp.interface module, calling super().__init__ with additional parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output, only internal class extension.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of OSQP object -> call to parent constructor with specific arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, straightforward class extension.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass OSQP that inherits from the imported _OSQP class. Its constructor calls the parent constructor with all received arguments, adding a fixed parameter algebra='mkl'. This enforces a specific configuration for the underlying OSQP solver. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leaks, network activity, or backdoors. The code does not perform any suspicious operations or contain obfuscated sections. It is a simple class override intended to set a parameter.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class extension intended to set a specific solver configuration. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
