{
  "purpose": "Subclassing the OSQP class to enforce the use of 'mkl' algebra configuration during initialization.",
  "sources": "The constructor of the subclass calls the parent constructor with all provided arguments and adds a fixed parameter 'algebra=\"mkl\"'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network operations, or data leaks are present; the code only modifies configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into the superclass constructor, with the fixed parameter 'algebra=\"mkl\"' applied during instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass that enforces a specific configuration ('algebra=\"mkl\"') for the OSQP solver. It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain malicious logic. The code is clear, correct, and serves as a configuration wrapper. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as a configuration wrapper to enforce a specific parameter. The assigned scores are consistent and justified; no modifications are necessary.",
