{
  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass of the OSQP interface to customize its initialization parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statement from osqp.interface module, use of class constructor with arguments",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential data flow from input arguments to superclass initialization",
  "flows": "Input arguments (*args, **kwargs) are passed to the superclass constructor with an added 'algebra' parameter",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward class extension",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and creates a subclass that modifies the initialization behavior by fixing the 'algebra' parameter to 'mkl'. The subclass does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or security-sensitive operations. It simply extends functionality with a specific configuration. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present. The code appears to be a standard pattern for customizing third-party library behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign subclass extension that sets a specific parameter in the OSQP interface. No malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
