  "analysis": "The code snippet contains solely a comment indicating build-time code generation, with no executable logic, data input/output, or security-sensitive operations. All reviews correctly identify this as a benign placeholder. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the content. Given the simplicity and benign nature, there are no anomalies or vulnerabilities to consider.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder comment with no executable content or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action needed.",
