  "purpose": "This module is populated with codegen src/header files at build time.",
  "sources": "Build process that inserts codegen src/header files",
  "sinks": "None identified; no runtime data processing or external outputs",
  "flows": "None; static placeholder indicating build-time code insertion",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder comment suggests dynamic code generation; no actual code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a comment indicating that the module's content is generated from src/header files during build time. There are no executable statements, data input sources, or potential points for untrusted data flow. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security-sensitive operations. The placeholder indicates a build-time process rather than runtime logic, reducing the likelihood of malicious activity within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a placeholder comment indicating code generation during build; it contains no executable code or suspicious behavior. There are no security risks associated with this fragment.",
