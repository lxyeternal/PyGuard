  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from code execution points, network requests, environment variables, and hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication to suspicious domains, file modifications, or execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables flow into code execution or network requests, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution functions (eval, exec), hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and network requests to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent with high confidence. Obfuscation levels are significant, supporting a malware score of 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.85. Other reports show minimal or benign code with no suspicious patterns, justifying low malware and risk scores. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors and code analysis, with high confidence in the malicious assessment for report 1 and moderate to high confidence in benign assessments for others.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior with significant obfuscation and security risk, justified by suspicious patterns. Other reports are benign, with no evidence of malicious activity. Scores are appropriately assigned based on the available information.",
