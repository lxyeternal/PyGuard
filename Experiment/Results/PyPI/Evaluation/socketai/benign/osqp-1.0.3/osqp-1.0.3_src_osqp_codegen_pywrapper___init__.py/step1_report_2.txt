{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of comments or docstrings, but it appears to involve importing modules and possibly executing code based on certain conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and possibly from environment variables or input functions if used later in omitted parts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writing, or executing commands if such code exists further in the code base, but not explicitly visible here.",
  "flows": "Without explicit code, flow analysis is limited. However, if the code imports modules and executes functions, data might flow from imported modules or inputs to sinks such as network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are visible. The code appears minimal and standard, but the lack of comments and context raises some concerns about completeness.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists of import statements only, with no further logic provided. This minimal structure is common and not inherently malicious. Absence of visible malicious patterns or obfuscation suggests low likelihood of embedded malware. However, the lack of context and further code limits thorough analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign but incomplete; additional code or context is needed for a comprehensive assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0,
