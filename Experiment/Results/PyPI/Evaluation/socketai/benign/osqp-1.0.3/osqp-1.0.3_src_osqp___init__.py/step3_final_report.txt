  "purpose": "Import version information and interface components from internal osqp modules for package setup and usage.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from osqp._version and osqp.interface modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static imports without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static import statements with a version management comment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of version info and interface classes/constants, with a comment indicating version management via setuptools-scm. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The imports are from internal modules, typical for package initialization. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with standard package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for versioning and interface access within the osqp package. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The current scores overstate any risk; a security risk score of approximately 0.0–0.1 accurately reflects its minimal security concern. Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.",
