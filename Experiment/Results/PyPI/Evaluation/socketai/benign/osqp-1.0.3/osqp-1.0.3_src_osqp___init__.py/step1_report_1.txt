{
  "purpose": "The code imports version information and several classes and constants from the 'osqp' package, likely for version management and providing interfaces for solving quadratic programming problems.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'osqp._version' and 'osqp.interface', which read data from external modules within the 'osqp' package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity; the code only imports symbols.",
  "flows": "The code imports data from internal modules, but there are no flows from untrusted sources to sinks; it is standard module import behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The comments indicate version management practices. The imported items are typical for a library interface.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and classes/constants from the 'osqp' package, which appears to be a quadratic programming solver. It includes comments about version control, which is typical. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The imports are static and typical for a Python package setup. No external data sources or user inputs are involved. The overall structure is simple and standard for a Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import module that pulls in version information and interface components from the 'osqp' package. There is no malicious behavior or security risk evident in this snippet. The code appears legitimate and typical for such a module.",
