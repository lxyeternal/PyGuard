  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code performs static import statements:\n  - Imports `version` from `osqp._version`.\n  - Imports several classes and constants from `osqp.interface`.\n- It includes a comment indicating that `_version.py` is managed by setuptools-scm and is not in version control.\n- The code appears to be part of a package's initialization or interface setup.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n**Confirmed:**  \n- The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious.\n- The imports are static, from internal modules, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n- The comment about version management aligns with standard practices.\n\n**No issues detected** in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**\n\n- The reports are consistent in stating that the code is straightforward, static, and typical for package setup.\n- They correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies.\n- The comments about version management are standard and do not indicate any security concern.\n\n**No logical flaws** in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which aligns with the absence of any suspicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- The highest risk score is 0.1, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n- No reason exists to elevate these scores because the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is accurate.\n- The code does not contain any malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Challenging Assumptions About Vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they focus on the static nature of the code.\n- No unwarranted claims are made about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n- The high confidence levels support the conclusion that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Assessment**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, standard package import code, no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\nThe code is a simple, standard module for version management and interface imports within the `osqp` package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the current analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
