  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**Overall Code Context:**\nThe code is a straightforward module that imports version information and several interface classes/constants from the internal 'osqp' package modules. It contains no dynamic code, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** The code imports version info and interface components; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the benign nature. The malware score is correctly 0. The confidence is high, and no anomalies are detected.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above; benign static imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The zero malware score aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar benign import code, standard package initialization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Again, straightforward imports, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence but still reasonable; no suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same benign import pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Not explicitly scored, but all reports indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the simplicity and standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nThe code is a simple, static import module for versioning and interface access within a Python package. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for minimal configuration complexity, but practically negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No adjustments needed.",
