  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted input handling or external data output",
  "flows": "No complex data flows; primarily static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and consists of importing version info and classes/constants from the osqp package modules. The comment indicates that the version is managed by setuptools-scm and is not version-controlled. The imported elements are standard and relevant to the package's API. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as code execution or data exfiltration, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears to serve a configuration or metadata purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
