  "purpose": "To import version information and classes/functions from the osqp package for use in the module.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from internal osqp modules (_version and interface).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data is sent or written outside the local environment.",
  "flows": "Importing version info and classes/functions without external data flow or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info from a module managed by setuptools-scm, which is standard for versioning. It also imports several classes and constants from the 'interface' module of osqp, which are likely used elsewhere in the project. All imports appear standard and do not involve untrusted data or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration activities. The code is minimal and serves the purpose of module initialization and access to package features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard import operations with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
