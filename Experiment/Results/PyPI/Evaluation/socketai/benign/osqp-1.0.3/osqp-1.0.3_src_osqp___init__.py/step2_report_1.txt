  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code snippet:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward module that imports version information and several interface classes/constants from internal modules of the 'osqp' package. It contains no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no data handling from untrusted sources, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic. The comments indicate standard version management practices. The imports are static and typical for a Python package setup.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the purpose; imports are from internal modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, no anomalies, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Critique:**  \nThe security risk score is 0.1, implying a very minor concern. Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, this seems slightly overestimated. The malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nSet `securityRisk` to 0 for a more accurate reflection of the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, benign static imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Critique:**  \nScores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, standard package initialization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Critique:**  \nScores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.9, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Critique:**  \nThe security risk score of 0.9 seems high given the benign code. The code is just static imports; there's no reason for a high security risk. This overestimates the potential for malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nLower `securityRisk` to 0 or very close to zero.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Critique:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring consistency:\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are slightly inflated in some reports (0.1 and 0.9). Given the simplicity and benign nature, these should be closer to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low, around 0.0–0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very minimal, just a standard import module)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is standard, benign, and typical for a package's version and interface import module. The current scores overstate potential risks slightly. I recommend setting the security risk to 0 and maintaining malware and obfuscated scores at 0.",
