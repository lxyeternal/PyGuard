  "purpose": "Import version information and classes/functions from internal modules for package setup and interface use.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from osqp._version and importing classes/functions from osqp.interface.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; imports are from internal modules.",
  "flows": "Importing version string and classes/functions without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The comments indicate normal package management behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static imports from internal modules, which is typical in package initialization scripts. The version is retrieved from a private module, and several interface elements are imported for use elsewhere. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing occurs here. The code structure and comments suggest standard package setup behavior without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports version info and interface classes/functions for internal use.",
