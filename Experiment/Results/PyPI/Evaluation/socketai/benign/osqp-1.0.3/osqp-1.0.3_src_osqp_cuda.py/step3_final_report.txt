  "purpose": "Subclass of OSQP to enforce GPU acceleration via 'algebra=\"cuda\"' parameter during initialization.",
  "sources": "Import from osqp.interface, class constructor arguments (*args, **kwargs).",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives args and kwargs, passes them with 'algebra=\"cuda\"' to superclass.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional setting of 'algebra=\"cuda\"' may impact performance or compatibility but not maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward subclass extension that enforces GPU acceleration by setting 'algebra=\"cuda\"' during initialization. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign intent and minimal security concern. The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain suspicious patterns. The setting of 'cuda' is a legitimate parameter for GPU use, not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for performance optimization with GPU acceleration. No security risks or malicious behavior are present. The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
