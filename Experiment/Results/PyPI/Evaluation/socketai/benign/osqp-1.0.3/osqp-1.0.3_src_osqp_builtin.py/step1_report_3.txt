  "purpose": "Subclassing the OSQP interface to modify initialization behavior by setting 'algebra' to 'builtin'.",
  "sources": "Import from osqp.interface module, instantiation of the OSQP class.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Construction of OSQP object, passing arguments to superclass constructor with a fixed parameter.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward subclassing with no unusual or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a known library, then creates a subclass that overrides the constructor to always set 'algebra' to 'builtin'. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The modification appears benign, possibly intended to enforce a specific configuration. No sources of untrusted input or sinks that could be exploited are evident. The code is minimal and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple subclass modification with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It enforces a specific parameter during object creation. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
