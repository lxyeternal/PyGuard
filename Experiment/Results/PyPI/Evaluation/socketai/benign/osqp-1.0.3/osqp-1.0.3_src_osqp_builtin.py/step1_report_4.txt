{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass OSQP that extends the imported _OSQP class and initializes it with a specific parameter.",
  "sources": "Import statement from osqp.interface, class instantiation, and __init__ method with args and kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of OSQP calls super().__init__ with args, kwargs, and an explicit 'algebra' parameter set to 'builtin'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code simply modifies a constructor parameter.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass OSQP that inherits from _OSQP. The constructor forwards all arguments to the parent class's constructor, adding a fixed keyword argument 'algebra' set to 'builtin'. There is no indication of malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. Usage of inheritance and constructor override appears straightforward. No anomalies like code injection, hidden behaviors, or security issues are evident. The code primarily alters a parameter for the parent class initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a straightforward subclass extension with a specific parameter. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
