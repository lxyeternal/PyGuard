  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code defines a subclass `OSQP` that inherits from `_OSQP` imported from `osqp.interface`. The constructor of this subclass calls the superclass constructor with all passed arguments, but explicitly sets the `algebra` parameter to `'builtin'`. The code is straightforward, with no apparent malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is a simple subclass extension with no suspicious or malicious elements. They confirm that the code functions as intended, mainly to set a specific parameter during instantiation.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears correct, standard, and free of errors.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. Confidence scores are high (0.9-1), which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is transparent and readable.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Given the simplicity and benign nature, a low score (~0.1) seems justified, as some minimal risk might be associated with subclassing or parameter setting, but nothing significant.\n\n- **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n  No claims in the reports are based on assumptions; all agree the code is benign.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided reports and the code:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly even 0, given the benign nature)  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple subclass override, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The minimal risk score reflects the slight concern about subclassing but is not justified to be higher.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- The assigned scores are reasonable, though a risk score of 0 could also be justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 if conservative)  \n\n**Overall, the code is safe and legitimate.**",
