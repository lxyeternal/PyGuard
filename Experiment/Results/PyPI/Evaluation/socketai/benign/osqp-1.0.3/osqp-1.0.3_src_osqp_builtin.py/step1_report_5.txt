{
  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass OSQP that extends the interface OSQP from the osqp library, customizing the constructor.",
  "sources": "Import from osqp.interface module, class instantiation, and constructor parameters",
  "sinks": "None present; no direct data leaks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Instantiation of OSQP class with potential arguments passed to the superclass constructor",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated or suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply subclasses an existing OSQP interface class, modifying the constructor to set the 'algebra' parameter to 'builtin'. This is a standard extension pattern with no apparent malicious intent. There are no indications of data exfiltration, code injection, or covert behaviors. It does not include network operations, file manipulations, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward subclass override with no malicious activity, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified.",
