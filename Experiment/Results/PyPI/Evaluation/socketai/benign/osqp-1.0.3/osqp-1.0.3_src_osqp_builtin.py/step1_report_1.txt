{
  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass of the OSQP class, likely to customize or extend its functionality.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'OSQP' from the 'osqp.interface' module and uses it as a superclass. It reads data when the superclass constructor is invoked.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. It primarily delegates to the superclass.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to the OSQP constructor flows into the superclass constructor with an added parameter 'algebra=\"builtin\"'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code simply extends a class and overrides the constructor.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external package and creates a subclass that modifies initialization behavior by setting the 'algebra' parameter. There are no inputs, outputs, or network operations within this snippet. The code appears straightforward and standard for subclassing. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple subclass extension with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose of customizing the OSQP interface.",
