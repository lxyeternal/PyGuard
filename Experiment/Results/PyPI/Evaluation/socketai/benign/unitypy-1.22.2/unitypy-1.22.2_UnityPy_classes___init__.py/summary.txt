  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily performing standard import operations. The only potential concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be reviewed to ensure module integrity, but no malicious activity is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2) due to import practices."
