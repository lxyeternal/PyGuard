{
  "purpose": "Define a class for objects of unknown type during type tree parsing, likely used for handling unrecognized or dynamic data structures.",
  "sources": "Initialization via constructor (__init__) with optional node and additional keyword arguments; access to self.__node__ and self.__dict__ in methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements accessing self.__node__ and self.__dict__; no data transmission, network activity, or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs, __node__) stored in object; get_type() reads self.__node__; __repr__() reads self.__node__ and self.__dict__ for string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious external communications, no obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with optional node data and other attributes, then provides methods to retrieve type information and string representation. The code performs standard attribute updates and retrievals without external or malicious actions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. It appears to be a straightforward data container and formatter.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured class designed for handling unknown objects during parsing. It contains no malicious or security-threatening behavior, and there are no signs of sabotage or malware. It appears safe.",
