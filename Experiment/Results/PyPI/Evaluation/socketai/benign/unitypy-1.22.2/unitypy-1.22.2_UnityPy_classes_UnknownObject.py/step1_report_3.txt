{
  "purpose": "Defines an 'UnknownObject' class representing objects of unspecified type during type parsing, providing custom string representation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; the code primarily operates on class attributes and optional parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the class functions are straightforward and do not process external input dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements present. The code appears to be standard class definition and string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for representing objects with unknown types, including an optional TypeTreeNode attribute and a customized __repr__ method. It performs string formatting and dictionary updates, which are safe operations. No untrusted input processing, dynamic code execution, or security-sensitive operations are observed. The class is structurally sound, and its methods are typical for data representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements.",
