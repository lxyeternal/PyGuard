{
  "purpose": "Represents an object of unknown type encountered during type tree parsing, serving as a data container with optional type information.",
  "sources": "Initialization with __node__ parameter, updating attributes via **kwargs, and internal attribute access in get_type() and __repr__().",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Attributes are set during initialization; get_type() accesses internal __node__ data; __repr__() reads internal attributes for string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Potential exposure of internal attributes via __repr__, but this is standard for debugging and not malicious; dynamic update of __dict__ with kwargs could inject attributes if kwargs are untrusted, but no code execution occurs.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward data container for unknown objects, with methods for retrieving type info and string representation. No external input processing, network activity, or code execution is present. The use of __dict__.update(**kwargs) is common but could pose a risk if kwargs are untrusted; however, since no evaluation or execution of these attributes occurs, this is not a security concern. The get_type() method exposes internal type info, which is acceptable for debugging. The __repr__() method only reads internal data for display. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. All signals point to benign, standard code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data container used during parsing. It does not perform any malicious actions, expose sensitive data, or contain obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
