{
  "purpose": "Define a class UnknownObject that represents an object of unknown type during type tree parsing, with methods for retrieving its type and string representation.",
  "sources": "The class reads data from its own attributes (__node__, __dict__, and method parameters). It also accesses __node__.m_Type if available.",
  "sinks": "The get_type method potentially exposes internal type information. The __repr__ method constructs a string representation but does not execute untrusted code or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Attributes (__node__, __dict__) are used within methods to generate output. No untrusted data flows into external systems or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution are present. The class uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The class is straightforward, providing a container for unknown objects with optional type info. It performs standard attribute access and string formatting. No indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not execute external code, perform network I/O, or handle untrusted input in a dangerous manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility class for representing unknown objects during parsing. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
