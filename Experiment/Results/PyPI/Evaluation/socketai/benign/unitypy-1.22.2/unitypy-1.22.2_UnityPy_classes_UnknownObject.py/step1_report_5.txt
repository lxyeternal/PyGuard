{
  "purpose": "Define a class 'UnknownObject' representing an object of unknown type during typetree parsing, primarily for internal data handling.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters (__node__, kwargs), access to self.__dict__ for dynamic attributes.",
  "sinks": "The __repr__ method constructs a string representation that accesses __dict__, which could potentially expose internal data if the object contains malicious attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from self.__dict__ into the __repr__ method to generate a string output, but this does not involve external untrusted input or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses dynamic attribute update and custom string formatting, which are standard techniques.",
  "analysis": "The class primarily manages internal data representation and formatting. There is no code that executes untrusted input, performs network communication, or interacts with external systems. The __repr__ method only generates a string based on internal attributes, with no side effects or malicious behavior. The dynamic attribute update via self.__dict__.update(**kwargs) is typical for such classes and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data container class with no malicious intent or security risks. It is unlikely to be used maliciously or to contain malware.",
