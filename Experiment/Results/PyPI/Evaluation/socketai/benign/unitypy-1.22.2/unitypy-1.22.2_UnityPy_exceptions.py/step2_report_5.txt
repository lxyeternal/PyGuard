  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The code in all reports matches the original code provided.\n   - No additional malicious or suspicious code elements are introduced.\n   - The classes are straightforward custom exception and warning classes, with standard constructors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the classes are simple, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious code.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - No issues with the way the classes are defined or used.\n\n3. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of external data handling, these scores seem appropriate.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is justified.\n   - No reason to increase the risk score, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:\n   - All reports assign malware = 0.\n   - This is correct; the code does not contain malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as standard class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The analysis aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exception and warning classes.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My Own Estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk**: 0 (no security concerns)\n\n**Final notes**:\n- The code is typical for error handling in Python projects.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
