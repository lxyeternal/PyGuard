{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for error handling related to type trees and Unity version fallback scenarios.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constructors with no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks as no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions and constructor methods with straightforward behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception and warning classes, each with basic constructors calling the superclass constructors. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no external resource usage, or security-sensitive actions. The structure is typical for custom exception/warning class definitions in Python. No suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a simple setup for custom exception and warning handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks in this snippet.",
