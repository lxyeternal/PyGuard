  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code defines three custom classes inheriting from standard Python exception and warning classes.\n- The constructors are straightforward, passing messages to the superclass constructors.\n- No external data input, network operations, or file I/O are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The code appears to serve as a structural component for error handling in a larger application related to Unity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the original snippet exactly.\n   - No anomalies, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n   - No suspicious data flows or external interactions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and straightforward.\n   - No logical flaws or incorrect conclusions are evident.\n   - The reasoning that the code is standard and harmless is sound.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n   - No need for adjustment.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5.\n   - Given the code's benign nature, this is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 in all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code as harmless.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nThis code is a standard, harmless implementation of custom exception and warning classes. It plays a structural role in error handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, straightforward, and poses no security concerns.",
