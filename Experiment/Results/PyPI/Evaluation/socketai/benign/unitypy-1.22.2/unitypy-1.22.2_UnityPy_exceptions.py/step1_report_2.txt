{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for error handling related to type trees and Unity version fallbacks.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output points, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from source to sink as no input or external communication present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded messages, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception and warning classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions and warnings. The classes are used to encapsulate specific error and warning conditions. No input/output, external communication, or dynamic execution is present. The code appears straightforward, with proper inheritance and constructors. No obfuscated code, malicious constructs, or unusual patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception and warning classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
