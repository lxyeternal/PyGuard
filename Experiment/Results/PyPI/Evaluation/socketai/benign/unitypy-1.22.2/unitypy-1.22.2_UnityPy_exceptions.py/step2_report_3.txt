  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception and warning classes.\n- No external data input, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code simply defines classes with constructors passing messages to superclasses.\n- No suspicious data flows, external communications, or security-sensitive operations are present.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Step-by-step evaluation:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code matches the original provided code.\n   - No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n   - The class definitions are conventional and correct.\n\n2. **Potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior:**\n   - No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - No external data sources or dynamic code execution.\n   - The passing of message parameters is standard for exception classes.\n\n3. **Scores and reasoning:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, as the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n   - The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's straightforward nature.\n   - No unwarranted concerns are raised.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code appears to be part of a larger application, serving as custom exception/warning definitions.\n- Its simplicity and adherence to standard patterns further support a benign interpretation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided reports and analysis, I concur that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
