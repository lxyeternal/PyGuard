{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for error handling related to type trees and Unity version fallback issues.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__) and superclass constructors (super().__init__(message))",
  "sinks": "Super constructor calls with message parameter, potential for passing untrusted input (though not evident here)",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception/warning objects, calling super().__init__(message)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation; classes are straightforward and conventional",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception and warning classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions. Each class's __init__ method simply passes a message string to the superclass constructor and, in one case, stores a nodes attribute. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no external data reads, and no suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns. The code appears to serve as a structured way to handle specific error/warning scenarios related to Unity version management and type tree errors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless implementation of custom exception and warning classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
