  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code's security implications.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\nThe provided code defines three classes:\n- `TypeTreeError(Exception)` with an `__init__` that takes `message` and `nodes`, passing `message` to the superclass and storing `nodes`.\n- `UnityVersionFallbackError(Exception)` with an `__init__` that takes `message` and passes it to the superclass.\n- `UnityVersionFallbackWarning(UserWarning)` with an `__init__` that takes `message` and passes it to the superclass.\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- The classes are straightforward custom exception and warning classes.\n- No external data reading, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The `nodes` attribute in `TypeTreeError` is stored but not used here; it could be used elsewhere.\n- All constructors are standard and do not perform any complex logic.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with no external data or suspicious operations.\n- The confidence level is high (1), and no anomalies or security risks are identified.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or below in all reports. Since the code is purely structural and not executing any untrusted input or external code, the security risk remains minimal.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- Given the analysis, the scores assigned are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk from this code snippet.\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code appears to be a standard, harmless implementation of custom exception and warning classes used for error handling in a larger application, likely related to Unity development. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
