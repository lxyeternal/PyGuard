  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining three custom classes: two exceptions (`TypeTreeError`, `UnityVersionFallbackError`) and one warning (`UnityVersionFallbackWarning`).\n- The classes are straightforward, with constructors passing messages to superclasses, and only one class (`TypeTreeError`) stores an additional attribute (`nodes`).\n- No external data, input/output, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty in the benign nature.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code matches the description: simple class definitions with no security concerns.\n- No evidence of data flows involving untrusted input or external data.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The purpose is solely for structured error handling.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports uniformly assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The malware scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk:** 0 is appropriate; the code is harmless.\n\n**Overall estimate:**\n\nGiven the consistent, thorough analysis and the straightforward nature of the code, I agree with the assessments provided. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are reasonable and should remain as-is.\n- The code is benign; no further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis, confirming that the code is a standard, harmless implementation of custom exception and warning classes.",
