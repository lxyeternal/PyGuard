{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception and warning classes for error handling related to Unity version fallback and type errors.",
  "sources": "Class constructors accepting message parameters; no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into superclass constructors; no external or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three simple class definitions inheriting from standard Python exception and warning classes. The constructors pass messages to superclasses, with one class storing an additional attribute 'nodes'. There are no external data reads, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose appears solely to facilitate structured error handling in a larger application, likely related to Unity development. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code is standard, clear, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception and warning classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
