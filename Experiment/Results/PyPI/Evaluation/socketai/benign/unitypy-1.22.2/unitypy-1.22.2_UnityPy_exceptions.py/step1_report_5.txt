{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for error handling related to type trees and Unity version fallback scenarios.",
  "sources": "Class constructors (__init__) that initialize exception or warning messages.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(message) calls, which pass data to base class constructors.",
  "flows": "Input message data flows from parameters into super().__init__, but only as part of standard exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. Classes are standard custom exceptions and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom classes inheriting from Exception and UserWarning. Each constructor calls the superclass constructor with a message parameter, which is standard practice. No data is read from external sources, nor are there any suspicious data flows or obfuscated elements. The classes serve for error handling and do not perform any network, file, or data operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python exception and warning class definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
