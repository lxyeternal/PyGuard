{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes for error handling and warnings related to type trees and Unity version fallback scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs read; the code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only creates class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the classes are straightforward custom exception and warning definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom classes inheriting from built-in exception and warning classes, with standard initializers passing messages and attributes. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The classes are purely structural for error handling. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve a typical purpose in error management within a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines custom exception and warning classes for use elsewhere in an application.",
