  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static registry mapping Unity ClassIDType enums to class objects. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a very low security risk score. The code poses negligible security concern and is safe for use."
