  "purpose": "Static mapping of ClassIDType enum values to their corresponding class objects for Unity asset management.",
  "sources": "Imports of class modules and enum definitions; static dictionary initialization.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "None; purely static mapping without data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. Commented placeholders are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of extensive imports and a large, static dictionary mapping enum identifiers to class objects. It is a declarative registry used for Unity asset type identification. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Commented lines are benign placeholders, and the overall pattern indicates a configuration or registry module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static registry mapping Unity ClassIDType enums to class objects. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a very low security risk score. The code poses negligible security concern and is safe for use.",
