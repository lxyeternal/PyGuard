{
  "purpose": "Define math-related data structures for vector, matrix, quaternion, and color representations.",
  "sources": "Import of 'attrs' library, class constructors, and property methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that untrusted data can influence directly. The only notable sink is the 'rgba' property setter, which processes integer color values.",
  "flows": "ColorRGBA constructor and 'rgba' property setter convert between float and integer color formats; no external input processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions with no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple vector, matrix, quaternion, and color classes using attrs, primarily for data storage. The ColorRGBA class supports initialization via individual floats or an integer 'rgba' value, with corresponding conversion methods. There is no code execution, network activity, or data leaks. No input/output streams or external data sources are involved. The code structure and formatting are standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of mathematical data structures with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a data container without any suspicious or harmful behaviors. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
