{
  "purpose": "Define mathematical vector, matrix, quaternion, and color classes for use in graphics or calculations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; only class definitions and initializations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output mechanisms that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; all data is contained within class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected. The only dynamic feature is the rgba property setter and constructor, which process color values, but these are standard and safe operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions with attributes and simple methods for representation and color handling. No external input handling, network communication, or code execution features are present. The use of attrs for class creation is benign. The ColorRGBA class includes a constructor and property for manipulating color values through bitwise operations, which are standard practices for color encoding. No suspicious or malicious patterns are found; the code serves purely as data structure definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard collection of mathematical and color data structures for use in graphics or computational tasks. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, nor any suspicious operations. It is safe and does not present security concerns.",
