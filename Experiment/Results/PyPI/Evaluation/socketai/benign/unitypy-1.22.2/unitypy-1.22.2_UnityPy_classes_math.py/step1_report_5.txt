{
  "purpose": "Define mathematical and color-related classes for 2D, 3D, and 4D vectors, matrices, quaternions, and color RGBA representation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'attrs' library; class constructors; property methods; __repr__ and __new__ methods.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted input or data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; class properties and methods operate on internal state only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The __new__ method in ColorRGBA performs RGBA encoding from an integer, which is a standard approach.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for vector, quaternion, matrix, and color representations with straightforward initializations and property methods. The __new__ method in ColorRGBA allows instantiation from an integer RGBA value, which is a common pattern. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears purely structural and mathematical without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of mathematical class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as utility classes for graphics or mathematical computations. No suspicious activities or malicious patterns are present.",
