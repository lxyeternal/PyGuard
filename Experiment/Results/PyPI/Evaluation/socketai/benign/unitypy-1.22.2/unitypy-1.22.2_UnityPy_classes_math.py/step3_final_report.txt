  "purpose": "Defines mathematical vector, matrix, quaternion, and color data structures for graphics or scientific computations, utilizing attrs for concise class definitions.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and property methods, primarily within ColorRGBA for color encoding/decoding.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "ColorRGBA constructor and rgba property setter/getter perform internal bitwise operations for color encoding/decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected; standard color encoding logic used.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data classes with straightforward attribute definitions. The ColorRGBA class's constructor and property methods perform standard bitwise operations for color packing/unpacking, which are common in graphics programming. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is transparent, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious signatures. The minimal security risk associated with color encoding is standard and safe. Overall, the code poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of data structures for vectors, matrices, quaternions, and colors, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening features. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
