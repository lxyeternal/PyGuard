{
  "purpose": "Define mathematical classes for vectors, matrices, quaternions, and colors used in graphics or calculations.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads input parameters for object initialization and property access (e.g., rgba setter and getter).",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks that handle untrusted data; the code does not perform network, file, or system operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., rgba value) flow into object properties, with property setters and initializers handling data transformation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several data classes for mathematical vectors, matrices, quaternions, and colors, utilizing attrs for concise class definitions. The ColorRGBA class supports initialization via separate color components or a packed RGBA integer, with corresponding property accessors and mutators. All classes are standard data holders with no input/output operations, network calls, or file access. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical utility module intended for use within larger applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign mathematical utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily defines data structures and simple property management without external data handling or security-sensitive operations.",
