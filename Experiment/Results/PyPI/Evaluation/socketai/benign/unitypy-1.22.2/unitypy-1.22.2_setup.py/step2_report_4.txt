  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard build procedures—reading source files, system info, and compiler version via subprocess.\n- **Sinks:** Appending resource paths to package data, constructing native library paths based on platform.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code; subprocess use is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The logic aligns with standard build scripts. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low, due to subprocess use for version detection, which is common).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The low security risk score is justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, managing build and packaging.\n- **Sinks:** Filesystem interactions, subprocess for version detection, no untrusted data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard build script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, build configuration, system info, resource paths.\n- **Sinks:** Filesystem, subprocess, package data modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation; subprocess is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical cross-platform build script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build setup, compiler detection, resource management.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess calls, package data modification.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard build script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Managing build, platform-specific resources, compiler info.\n- **Sinks:** Appending resource paths, subprocess calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The use of subprocess is standard for compiler detection, not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are low (0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily due to subprocess use, which is typical.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured build script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The current scores are reasonable and should not be adjusted upward.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Confirmed code is benign.  \n- No errors or flaws in logic or reasoning.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n- No further action needed.",
