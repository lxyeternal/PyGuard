  "purpose": "The code configures the build process for a Python extension module, handling platform-specific resource paths, compiler version detection, and packaging details.",
  "sources": "Filesystem (reading source files and resource directories), subprocess (detecting compiler version), environment variables (indirectly via system info).",
  "sinks": "Appending resource paths to package data, constructing platform-specific library paths, and setting compiler flags based on detected compiler version.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (filesystem, subprocess output) influence resource path selection and compiler flags, which are then used during build and packaging steps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors. Subprocess calls are standard for compiler detection. No unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard build configuration tasks: detecting compiler version via subprocess, setting platform-specific resource paths, and managing package data. It does not include any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The subprocess usage is typical in build scripts and does not indicate malicious intent. The platform detection and resource inclusion are straightforward and based on system info. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and packaging script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. It can be considered safe and standard for its purpose.",
