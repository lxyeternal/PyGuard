  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to build and package a Python extension module 'UnityPy.UnityPyBoost' with optional C++ dependencies and platform-specific resources.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory for C++ source files, reads environment variables and system information for platform-specific paths, and uses subprocess to determine compiler version.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess to run compiler version check, appends platform-specific resource paths to package data, constructs file paths for native libraries based on system and architecture.",
  "flows": "Source: os.listdir and subprocess run to gather source files and compiler info -> Sinks: appending resource paths to package data, returning paths for native libraries based on system info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of subprocess to determine compiler version could be exploited if environment is compromised, but this is standard for build scripts. No malicious code or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily configures build parameters, handles platform-specific resource paths, and manipulates package data. It dynamically determines compiler flags based on compiler type and version, and constructs paths for native libraries. The subprocess call for version detection, while potentially risky if environment is compromised, is typical for build scripts. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or hidden backdoors. All operations align with legitimate build and packaging processes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build configuration for a Python extension module with platform-specific resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of subprocess for compiler version detection is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
