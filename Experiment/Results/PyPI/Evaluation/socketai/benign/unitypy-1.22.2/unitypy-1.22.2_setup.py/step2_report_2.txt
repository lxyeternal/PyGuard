  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, anomalies, reasoning, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The script is a standard build configuration, with subprocess used to determine compiler version, platform-specific resource paths, and no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious code found.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — justified as low, given the standard build tasks and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Comments**: The reasoning is sound; subprocess usage is typical for compiler detection. No anomalies or suspicious logic.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate scoring; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on typical build and packaging activities, no malicious intent or suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 — very low, justified by the lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear.\n- **Comments**: The reasoning is solid; no hidden malicious logic.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, a typical build script handling platform-specific resource paths, with subprocess for compiler detection.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — justified as low; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — straightforward code.\n- **Comments**: The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, managing build configurations, platform detection, and resource inclusion.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious code.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0.\n- **Comments**: No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Focuses on build and packaging, with subprocess calls for compiler info and resource path management.\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.2 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0.\n- **Comments**: No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores**: All zero, consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity or code obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated**: All zero, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores**: Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), justified given the use of subprocess and platform-specific logic, but these are standard practices in build scripts.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n- No modifications needed; the analysis correctly identifies the code as legitimate build configuration with no malicious intent.\n- The use of subprocess for compiler detection, while potentially risky if environment is compromised, is typical and not malicious.\n\n### My own estimate (post-review):\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk**: 0.2 — due to subprocess use, but overall low risk.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the code's benign nature.",
