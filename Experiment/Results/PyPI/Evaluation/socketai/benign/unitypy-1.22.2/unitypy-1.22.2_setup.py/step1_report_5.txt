{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building, distributing, and packaging a Python project named 'UnityPy' with C++ extensions and platform-specific resources.",
  "sources": "Reading files from 'UnityPyBoost' directory, subprocess calls to determine compiler version, environment variables, and platform-specific paths.",
  "sinks": "Appending FMOD library paths to package data in 'BDistWheel.run()', potentially executing subprocesses for compiler info, and file system modifications during distribution.",
  "flows": "Subprocess runs capture compiler info; get_fmod_path constructs platform-specific library paths; BDistWheel.run() adds these paths to package data; setup() gathers extensions and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors; subprocess invocation for compiler info is standard; platform-specific path handling is typical; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages build and packaging processes, including compiler configuration and resource inclusion. The subprocess call retrieves compiler version info, which is common in build scripts. No data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoor code is present. The code is structured for legitimate build automation with platform-specific resource management. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected. Overall, the code performs expected setup tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building and packaging a Python project with C++ extensions and platform-specific resources. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The script is well-structured for its purpose and shows no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
