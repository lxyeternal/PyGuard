  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a build setup for 'UnityPyUnityPyBoost', with source files, system info, and subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Describes appending platform-specific resource paths and constructing native library paths accurately.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or backdoors; subprocess is used for compiler version detection, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion states low security risk, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity. Confidence 0.9 is reasonable.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- Security Risk: 0.2 (minimal, mainly due to subprocess usage which is typical)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the script's role in building and packaging, with standard source and system info.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flow; resource paths are system-specific.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; subprocess for compiler version detection is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low security risk, high confidence.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes cross-platform build setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies resource path construction and platform detection.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code; subprocess for compiler version detection is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, low risk.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; discusses build configuration and resource management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes subprocess calls and platform detection.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity; subprocess use is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriate.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; covers build and resource inclusion.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly describes appending resource paths and subprocess use.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; subprocess is used for compiler detection.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a standard build script.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the subprocess call for compiler detection, but this is typical and not risky.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** are justified as 0 across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are justified as 0.\n- The **security risk scores** are slightly conservative but reasonable, given the subprocess usage, which could be misused if environment variables are compromised, but is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to subprocess call, but this is typical and not inherently risky)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code, and the scores are appropriate. The code appears to be a legitimate build script with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
