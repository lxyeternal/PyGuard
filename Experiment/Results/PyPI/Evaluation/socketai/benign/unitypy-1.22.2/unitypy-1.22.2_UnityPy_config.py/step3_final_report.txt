  "purpose": "Validate and manage the global fallback Unity version, raising errors if invalid and issuing warnings when defaulting.",
  "sources": "Reading the global variable FALLBACK_UNITY_VERSION",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data flow",
  "flows": "Access of FALLBACK_UNITY_VERSION, validation, exception raising, warning issuance",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation logic",
  "analysis": "The code checks if FALLBACK_UNITY_VERSION is a string; raises an error if not, otherwise warns and returns it. No network activity, data leaks, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The logic is simple and standard for configuration validation. The global variable could be externally modified, but this is typical for configuration settings and not a security concern. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard configuration validation snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (considering potential external modification of a global variable), which are consistent with the code's behavior.",
