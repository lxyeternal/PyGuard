  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is standard setup with no malicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.9. These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for scores:** The low risk and malware scores are appropriate; the slight confidence reflects the thoroughness.\n- **Overall:** No concerns. The code is just import and alias setup.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No, only import statements.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Confidence=1. These are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Importing a function alone isn't malicious; no usage or data flow indicates risk.\n- **Overall:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No, straightforward import and aliasing.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Confidence=0.95. These are reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the slight risk score accounts for the potential relevance of the imported function if misused elsewhere.\n- **Overall:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No, standard setup.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Confidence=1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior; the import of decryption functions alone isn't malicious.\n- **Overall:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No, similar to others.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Confidence=1. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected; the import is benign.\n- **Overall:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (slightly above zero due to potential misuse of imported functions, but overall very low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code snippets are standard setup code with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.",
