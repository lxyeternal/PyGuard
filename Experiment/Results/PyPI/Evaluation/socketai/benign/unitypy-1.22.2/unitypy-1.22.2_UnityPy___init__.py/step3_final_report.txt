  "purpose": "Set version info, import Environment class, and import a decryption key function for potential use elsewhere; establish backward compatibility aliases.",
  "sources": "Import statements for version string, Environment class, and set_assetbundle_decrypt_key function.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static setup with no execution of imported functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and aliasing without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string, imports a class and a function, and creates aliases for backward compatibility. The imported function is not invoked here, and there are no network calls, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. The code is simple and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The presence of the decryption function import alone does not imply malicious activity, especially since it is not used in this snippet. The overall structure indicates a benign setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign setup/configuration code with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The imported decryption function is not invoked, and no data leaks or malicious actions are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
