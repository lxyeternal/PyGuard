{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up and expose environment-related functionality, including backward compatibility aliases, for a larger Python package or application.",
  "sources": "The code imports environment settings from a local module (.environment) and a specific function set_assetbundle_decrypt_key from a nested helpers module (.helpers.ArchiveStorageManager).",
  "sinks": "The code assigns the Environment class to variables for use elsewhere, but no direct sinks like system commands or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The imported Environment is assigned directly to 'load' and 'AssetsManager', creating aliases; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The function set_assetbundle_decrypt_key is imported but not invoked or used within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code defines versioning information, imports classes and functions from local modules, and creates aliases for backward compatibility. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The import of set_assetbundle_decrypt_key could be relevant if used elsewhere, but its presence alone here is benign. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not exhibit anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module setup with version info, imports, and alias creation. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. It appears to be part of a larger package's infrastructure without any malicious intent within this snippet.",
