{
  "purpose": "Define module version, import Environment class, and set up backward compatibility aliases.",
  "sources": "Import statements from environment and helpers modules, possibly reading code files and environment variables if used internally.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution points are visible.",
  "flows": "Import data flows from environment and helpers modules into the current namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the explicit aliasing of Environment to load and AssetsManager, which is common for backward compatibility but should be checked for malicious intent if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up version information and imports classes/functions. It creates aliases for the Environment class for backward compatibility. There are no visible malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The set_assetbundle_decrypt_key function is imported but not used within this snippet, so its purpose cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily setting up imports and aliases with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be standard setup code for a module with no security concerns based on this fragment.",
