{
  "purpose": "Defines version, imports Environment class, and sets up a decrypt key; provides backward compatibility alias.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing Environment and set_assetbundle_decrypt_key from helpers.ArchiveStorageManager.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data processing, network activity, or sensitive information handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple import and assignment statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. The only potentially notable aspect is the import of a decryption key setter, but it's not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version info, imports classes and functions, and creates an alias for backward compatibility. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The presence of a function to set an asset bundle decryption key might be relevant if misused, but within this snippet, it appears to be a standard utility function import.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a setup/configuration module with no suspicious behavior.",
