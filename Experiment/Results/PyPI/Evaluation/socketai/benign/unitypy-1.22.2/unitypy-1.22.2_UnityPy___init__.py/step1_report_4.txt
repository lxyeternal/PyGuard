{
  "purpose": "Defines version, imports environment management and archive storage helper, and sets load and AssetsManager aliases for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from environment and helpers modules",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements are static",
  "anomalies": "Use of backward compatibility alias; no suspicious code behavior or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version info, imports classes and functions, and creates aliases. No user input, network communication, or sensitive data handling present. The set_assetbundle_decrypt_key function could be related to decryption, but without implementation details, no malicious activity can be inferred. Overall, the code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily setting up imports and aliases without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No security issues identified based on this snippet.",
