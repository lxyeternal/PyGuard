{
  "purpose": "The script is used to set up and configure the 's2sphere' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 's2sphere/__init__.py' and reads the 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; setup parameters are static or derived from trusted files.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from package source to assign to setup, reads README for description; no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extracts a version string from a package's __init__.py file and reads a README file for long description. It then uses setuptools.setup() with static parameters and dependencies. No untrusted input, external data sources, or suspicious behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated code. The code adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe to use.",
