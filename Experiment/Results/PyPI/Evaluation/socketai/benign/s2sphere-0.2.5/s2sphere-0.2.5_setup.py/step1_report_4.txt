  "purpose": "Setup script for the s2sphere Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 's2sphere/__init__.py', reads README.rst for long description.",
  "sinks": "Uses open() to read files; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks like network or system commands.",
  "flows": "File reading sources feed into variables used in package setup; no data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward package setup script with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The script extracts version info from a source file and sets up package configuration including dependencies and metadata. No code injection, network activity, or other suspicious behavior detected. Uses standard Python setup tools without dynamic code execution or obfuscation. All operations are typical for a Python package setup process.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly reads version info and package data without untrusted input or malicious code.",
