  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports focus on a very minimal code snippet: a module docstring, a flake8 directive, an import statement, and a version string.\n- The import statements are all from a local 'sphere' module, with some using wildcard imports.\n- No functions, data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The reports correctly identify the minimal nature of the code and the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; it's a simple module setup. No issues or malicious code are evident.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no network activity, no code obfuscation, no suspicious imports or patterns.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws\n- The reports correctly interpret the minimal code and do not overstate risks.\n- Use of wildcard import (`from .sphere import *`) is noted, which can be a best practice concern but not a security risk per se.\n- No report claims or implies malicious intent or vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n\n### Score Justifications\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0 or 0.2), reflecting the minimal code and lack of external interactions.\n\n### Recommendations for Score Adjustments\n- The highest confidence score is 1, which is appropriate given the clear minimal code.\n- The slightly higher security risk scores (0.2) in some reports are acceptable due to the wildcard import concern, but overall, the risk remains minimal.\n- No report overstates or understates the risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and minimal.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. The code appears to be a benign component of an open-source library, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, minimal module setup with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
