  "purpose": "Pure Python implementation of s2-geometry library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package (.sphere import *)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Importing from .sphere module; no data flow visible in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only version declaration and import statement; no suspicious or unusual code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module initialization with a version string and an import statement. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. The import of a local module suggests standard package structure. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet appears to be a benign component of a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
