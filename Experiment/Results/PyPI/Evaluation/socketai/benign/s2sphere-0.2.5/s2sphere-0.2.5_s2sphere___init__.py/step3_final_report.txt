  "purpose": "Minimal module setup for the s2-geometry library, primarily importing sphere functionalities.",

  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from .sphere import *`), which can obscure imported names but is not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initialization file with a docstring, a linter directive, an import statement, and a version string. No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The wildcard import is a potential best practice concern but not a security issue. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication are evident. The code's minimal nature and lack of active logic indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal package setup with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of wildcard import is a coding style concern but does not constitute a security risk. All signals point to a safe, standard module initialization.",
