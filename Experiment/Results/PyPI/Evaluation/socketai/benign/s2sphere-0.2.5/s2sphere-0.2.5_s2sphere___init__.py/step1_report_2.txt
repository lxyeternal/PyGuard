  "purpose": "Pure Python implementation of s2-geometry library.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .sphere import *",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity",
  "flows": "No data flows identified; code primarily imports modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*), which can obscure imported functions and variables, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, mainly defining the version and importing from a local module. The wildcard import could potentially hide malicious or unintended code if the sphere module contains malicious code, but there is no direct evidence here. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with minimal content. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment. The use of wildcard import is a best practice concern but not a security threat in itself.",
