  "purpose": "To provide a pure Python implementation of the s2-geometry library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from sphere module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input points identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks evident in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies; only import and metadata",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header with a version declaration and an import from a local sphere module. There are no functions, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The import statement appears to be standard, assuming the sphere module is legitimate. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module header for a geometry library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a minimal setup file with no active code execution or sensitive operations.",
