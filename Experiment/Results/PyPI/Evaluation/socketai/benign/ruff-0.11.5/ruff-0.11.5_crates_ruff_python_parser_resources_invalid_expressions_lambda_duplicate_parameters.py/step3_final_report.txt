{
  "purpose": "The code snippets are malformed lambda functions with duplicate parameter names, which are invalid in Python and prevent execution. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "sources": "Parameter definitions within lambda functions, specifically duplicate parameter names and unusual syntax patterns such as *a and **a.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input or data flows, nor does it invoke or execute any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No runtime flows; the code only contains function definitions that are invalid and unexecutable.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate parameter names in lambda functions, use of *a and **a in parameter lists, which are syntactically valid but unusual; overall, the code is invalid due to syntax errors.",
  "analysis": "All code snippets contain duplicate parameter names, which violate Python syntax rules and would cause syntax errors. The use of *a and **a is syntactically valid but uncommon. No external data sources, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be malformed or illustrative rather than malicious. The syntax errors prevent execution, indicating these are test or malformed snippets rather than active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is invalid due to syntax errors caused by duplicate parameter names. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk scores and malware scores of zero are appropriate. The code's primary issue is syntax invalidity, not malicious intent.",
