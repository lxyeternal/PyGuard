  "purpose": "Define multiple lambda functions with various parameter configurations, primarily for demonstration or testing parameter syntax.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; all code consists of lambda function definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or untrusted data processing occur; no sink functions involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; these are simple lambda definitions with no execution or invocation.",
  "anomalies": "All lambda functions have invalid or suspicious syntax: duplicate parameter names, improper use of asterisk (*), and default values with the same parameter name multiple times. The code contains syntax errors and does not execute as-is.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to define multiple lambda functions with various parameter lists. Several lines contain syntax errors: duplicate parameter names ('a' used twice), misuse of * (positional-only or unpacking syntax incorrectly), and invalid parameter naming or defaulting. These issues suggest either obfuscated code or a demonstration of invalid syntax. No malicious activity is apparent; the main concern is the syntax invalidity which would prevent execution. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data leakage, or harmful behavior. The code appears to be either a syntax test or poorly written code, not malicious in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains multiple syntax errors preventing execution. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The anomalies are related to invalid lambda parameter syntax. Overall, the code is non-functional in its current form and shows no signs of malware or security threats.",
