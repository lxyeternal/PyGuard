  "purpose": "Demonstrates parser recovery with nested braces in Python, likely for testing or illustrative purposes.",
  "sources": "Input from the unclosed f-string and the call() function with incomplete syntax.",
  "sinks": "The call() function potentially acting as a sink if it executes untrusted input, but no actual execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Input from the f-string (though incomplete) could flow into call(), but the code does not execute anything.",
  "anomalies": "Unclosed braces in the f-string, incomplete parentheses, and incomplete code snippets.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are incomplete and contain syntax errors, indicating they are test cases or illustrative snippets rather than functional code. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks. The main concern is whether call() could execute untrusted input; however, as the code is incomplete and does not demonstrate execution, this remains hypothetical. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk given the context. Confidence is high (around 0.8-0.9) because the code's purpose is clearly testing parser behavior, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a test or demonstration snippet with syntax errors, not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
