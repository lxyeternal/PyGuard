  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, intentionally malformed syntax tests with no malicious behavior or payloads. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.1—are justified and consistent with their purpose. No adjustments are necessary, and the overall security assessment should remain low risk."
