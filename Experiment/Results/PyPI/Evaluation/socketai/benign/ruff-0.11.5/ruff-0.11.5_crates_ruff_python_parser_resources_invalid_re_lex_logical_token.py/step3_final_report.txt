{
  "purpose": "The code snippets are intentionally malformed Python syntax tests designed to evaluate parser or lexer robustness, not to execute meaningful or malicious logic.",
  "sources": "Input points include function definitions, call statements, string literals, brackets, parentheses, and indentation, all of which are syntactically incorrect or incomplete.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data flows, external communications, or data leaks; the code does not process or output data in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist; the code primarily consists of malformed syntax with no execution or data handling pathways.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains missing parentheses, inconsistent indentation, unclosed brackets and strings, trailing whitespaces, and nested parentheses—all intentional for testing parser edge cases.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are malformed intentionally, with syntax errors such as missing parentheses, inconsistent indentation, unclosed brackets, and malformed f-strings. These anomalies are typical in parser or lexer robustness testing. The assessments in the reports correctly identify these issues as non-malicious, purely syntactic, and designed for testing purposes. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent, payloads, or obfuscation. The high confidence scores reflect the clear understanding that these are syntax edge case tests, not malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, intentionally malformed syntax tests with no malicious behavior or payloads. The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.1—are justified and consistent with their purpose. No adjustments are necessary, and the overall security assessment should remain low risk.",
