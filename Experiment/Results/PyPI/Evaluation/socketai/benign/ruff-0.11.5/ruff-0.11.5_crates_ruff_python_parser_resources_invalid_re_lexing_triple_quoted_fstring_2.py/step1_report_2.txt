  "purpose": "Comment explaining lexer behavior related to triple-quoted f-strings and newline handling.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading sources in the code).",
  "sinks": "None (no data leaks, data processing, or untrusted data sinks).",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no input or untrusted data sources present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment referencing a known issue, and an f-string with a newline inside the expression part, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment explaining lexer behavior and a single triple-quoted f-string with a newline inside its expression. There are no external data inputs, no execution of untrusted code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The f-string appears to be a syntax example or note, not intended for malicious activity. The code does not perform any operations, data handling, or network communication. It is benign documentation with a code snippet demonstrating a specific string formatting behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a documentation comment explaining a technical detail about Python's f-string handling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
