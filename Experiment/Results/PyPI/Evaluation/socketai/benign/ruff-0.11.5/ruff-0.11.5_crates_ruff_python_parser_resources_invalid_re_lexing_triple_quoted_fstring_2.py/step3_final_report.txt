{
  "purpose": "The code snippets are primarily comments or illustrative examples referencing lexer behavior or syntax issues, with no executable logic or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Comments and code snippets containing triple-quoted strings and variable interpolations, but no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the snippets are static comments or examples without active data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Incomplete or unclosed string literals, which could cause syntax errors if executed, but are part of documentation or illustrative code.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify that these are benign comments or illustrative code snippets. The only potential concern is the use of variable 'foo' in f-strings, which could pose a security risk if 'foo' is untrusted in a real context, but the snippets themselves do not demonstrate any malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the minimal potential for harm. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious payloads is present. The overall assessment confirms these are safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign documentation or illustrative examples with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The minimal security risk is justified by the potential for untrusted input in real usage, but the snippets themselves pose no threat.",
