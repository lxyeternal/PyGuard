  "purpose": "Comment explaining lexer behavior related to triple-quoted f-strings and a linked GitHub issue.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources; the code contains only a comment and a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a comment and a string literal containing a potential syntax issue with an unclosed triple-quoted f-string. The string is incomplete and would cause a syntax error if executed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises a comment and a single string literal that attempts to define a triple-quoted f-string but is syntactically invalid due to missing closing quotes. There are no functions, data handling, or other code structures. The string does not execute any code or perform any operations. There is no evidence of malicious intent; it appears to be documentation or a note about lexer behavior and a GitHub issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and purely explanatory/documentational. There is no malicious behavior, security risk, or obfuscation present.",
