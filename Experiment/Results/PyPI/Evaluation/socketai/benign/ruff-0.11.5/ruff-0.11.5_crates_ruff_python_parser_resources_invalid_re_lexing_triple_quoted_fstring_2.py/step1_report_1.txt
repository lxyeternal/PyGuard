{
  "purpose": "Comment explaining lexer behavior with triple-quoted f-strings and a link to an issue report.",
  "sources": "Literal string content within the f-string, specifically the newline inside the triple quotes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely a comment with an f-string containing a newline.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a triple-quoted f-string with an embedded newline, which is harmless in this context. No malicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a single triple-quoted f-string that spans multiple lines, ending with an unclosed quote. It appears to be referencing a known issue regarding lexer behavior. There are no operations that process untrusted input, no data leaks, nor suspicious constructs. The code does not perform any actions, only documents a technical note.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-executable comment referencing a known lexer issue with triple-quoted f-strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and solely informational.",
