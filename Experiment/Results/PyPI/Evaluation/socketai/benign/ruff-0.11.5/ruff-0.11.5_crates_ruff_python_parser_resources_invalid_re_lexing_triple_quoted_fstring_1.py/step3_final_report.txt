  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code snippets containing embedded comments within formatted strings to assess malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Embedded comments within f-strings, variable assignments (`x`, `y`), and string literals containing comments and whitespace.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or code execution points if untrusted input is used in variable `x` or elsewhere; however, none are present in the snippets.",
  "flows": "Variable `x` (source) used within f-string (sink); comments are part of string content and do not influence execution; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comments with trailing whitespace inside string literals; no malicious or obfuscated code detected; variables are used benignly.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets involve benign use of comments within strings and simple variable assignments. No malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation is evident. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, and security risk scores are minimal (~0.1), justified by the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (≥0.9). The comments are part of string content, not executable code, and no external data flows or vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately assess the code as benign with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
