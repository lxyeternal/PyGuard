  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is minimal, setting a version string and issuing a deprecation warning about a package.\n- All reports agree that there are no external inputs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identified.\n- The warnings are standard and serve an informational purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: setting `__version__` and issuing a deprecation warning.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The logic is straightforward and standard.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code does not process external data, so no injection or data manipulation risks.\n- The use of `warnings.catch_warnings()` and `warnings.warn()` is standard practice.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n### Potential Risks:\n- The warning message is informational; no external system interactions or data leaks.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n- The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (negligible security risk)\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity and benign purpose, I concur with the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration and deprecation warning snippet. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues are present. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** No changes needed; the report accurately reflects the code's nature.",
