  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, assess the reasoning, and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward version assignment and a deprecation warning about the `rdflib-jsonld` package.\n- The code uses standard Python warnings modules, with no external inputs, data processing, or network interactions.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is identified.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code does **not** contain any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or anomalies.\n   - The deprecation warning is a standard practice and does not introduce security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as benign, with accurate reasoning.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, which is appropriate.\n   - The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code is purely informational, with no potential for harm.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - Since the code only issues a warning, with no malicious actions, malware=0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n   - This is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Estimated Scores Based on the Review:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, serves an informational purpose, and poses no security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard warning mechanism with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
