{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a version identifier and issue a deprecation warning regarding the rdflib-jsonld package, informing users to update their dependencies.",
  "sources": "The only source of input is the internal warnings module, which is used to issue a warning message.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function outputs a deprecation warning message, which could be displayed to the user or logged, but does not affect system security directly.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the version, then within a warnings context, it issues a warning about dependency deprecation; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard warnings module and no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets a version string, then uses the warnings module to display a deprecation message about a package. The use of catch_warnings and simplefilter is standard for controlling warning display. There are no inputs, no data flows, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code serves a simple informational purpose without performing any external actions or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to notify about package deprecation. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
