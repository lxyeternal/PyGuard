  "purpose": "Defines a version string and issues a deprecation warning about the rdflib-jsonld package being integrated into rdflib.",
  "sources": "Static code defining __version__ and calling warnings.warn() within warnings.catch_warnings() context.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() outputs a warning message; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Static source (__version__ and warning call) leading directly to warning output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: sets a version string and issues a static deprecation warning using standard Python warnings modules. No external inputs, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The warning serves an informational purpose, and the code performs no harmful actions. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no security risks or malware patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as an informational deprecation notice, and poses no security threat. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
