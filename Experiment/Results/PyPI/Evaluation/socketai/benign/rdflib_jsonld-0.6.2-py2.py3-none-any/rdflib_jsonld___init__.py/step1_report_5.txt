  "purpose": "Set version and issue a deprecation warning for the rdflib-jsonld package.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the warnings.catch_warnings() context block.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() call potentially logs a deprecation warning to the user, but does not leak sensitive data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The code defines version info, then triggers a deprecation warning within a controlled warnings context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the warning message is standard and relates to package deprecation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a package version and issues a DeprecationWarning informing users about the integrated rdflib-jsonld package. The warnings are handled within a warnings.catch_warnings() context that resets the warning filters to default. There are no inputs from external sources or malicious data flows. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware patterns are present. The warning message is informative and relates to package maintenance, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, primarily serving to inform users about a deprecation notice for a package. No malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident.",
