{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple version declaration and a warning message related to the rdflib-jsonld package deprecation.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the inline deprecation warning message.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external systems; no data leaks or harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no complex data flows; the warning is static and does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; the code is straightforward and typical for versioning and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string, then issues a deprecation warning about the rdflib-jsonld package being integrated into rdflib. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious activity are present. The use of warnings.catch_warnings and warnings.warn is standard for managing deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to inform developers of a package deprecation. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
