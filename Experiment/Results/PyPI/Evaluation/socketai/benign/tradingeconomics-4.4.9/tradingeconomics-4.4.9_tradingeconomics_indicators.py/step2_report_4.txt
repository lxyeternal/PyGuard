  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client for Trading Economics, constructing URLs from user inputs and fetching data. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. SSL context modification is standard for unverified HTTPS requests; no secrets are hardcoded besides the API key, which is stored externally.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified, no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — justified, code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to the unverified SSL context which could pose security concerns if sensitive data is involved, but in this context, it's standard practice.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code constructs URLs based on user input, reads API key from an external module, and performs data requests. No suspicious code or malicious behavior detected. SSL handling is standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, similar reasoning as above.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs API request URLs from user parameters, uses 'glob.apikey', and calls 'fn.dataRequest'. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. Input parameters are incorporated into URLs with minimal sanitization (via quote), which is standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, acceptable given the context.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. No malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code forms URLs with user inputs and API keys, calling 'fn.dataRequest'. No malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation observed. Proper validation and error handling are present.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, constructs API URLs from user inputs and external API key, calls 'fn.dataRequest'. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — low, standard API client behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious code detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) are reasonable considering the use of unverified SSL contexts and URL parameter handling, but these are common in API clients and do not suggest significant security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** Overall, the scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.\n\n- **Security:** The only minor concern is the use of `ssl._create_unverified_https_context`, which can expose data to man-in-the-middle attacks if used improperly. However, this is a common practice in some environments and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Supply Chain Security:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — appropriate.\n- **Risk:** Slightly higher (0.1–0.2) due to SSL context handling, but still low and justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of the reported scores, acknowledging minor SSL concerns)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
