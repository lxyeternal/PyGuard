  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client for Trading Economics, constructing URLs based on user inputs, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Strengths:** Proper error handling, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious network activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minor, possibly due to SSL context modification, which is common.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence that there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code functions as an API wrapper, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard URL construction, input validation, and safe handling.\n- **Strengths:** No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering standard practices.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a legitimate API client with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs URLs from user inputs and API keys, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Strengths:** Proper validation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the lack of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable, considering API key handling.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound; the code appears to be a standard, safe API wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on URL construction and external API requests.\n- **Strengths:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minor, related to API key management.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly concludes the code is a legitimate data retrieval module with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API client, with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Strengths:** Proper URL construction, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the code is a typical API wrapper with no signs of malware.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), mainly due to SSL context modification and API key handling, but these are standard practices in such modules.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client for Trading Economics.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage are evident.\n- The only minor concern is the SSL context modification, which is common but could be reviewed if data security is critical.\n- API key management relies on external 'glob', which should be securely handled outside this code.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — considering SSL context handling and API key management, but overall low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious or obfuscated components.",
