{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to fetch stock splits calendar data from an external API based on user input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'ticker', 'country', 'startDate', 'endDate', 'output_type'; external API URL; glob.apikey; potential user input within function calls.",
  "sinks": "External API request via fn.dataRequest; URL construction including API key; possible data transmission over network.",
  "flows": "User input (ticker, country, dates) -> URL construction and parameter appending -> API request via fn.dataRequest -> data transmission over network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; API key accessed via glob.apikey with try-except; usage of ssl context adjustment is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an API URL using user parameters and an API key stored in glob.apikey. It modifies the SSL context for unverified HTTPS requests, which could be insecure but is a known practice in some environments. The URL is assembled dynamically with user input, but no evident malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The function calls other modules (fn and glob) for data handling and validation, which are assumed benign. The try-except around glob.apikey suggests the API key is optional or may be missing, which raises a security warning but not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to perform standard API data retrieval with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data-fetching utility with appropriate checks and no signs of malicious activity. The use of unverified HTTPS context is a potential security concern but not malicious. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
