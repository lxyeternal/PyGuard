  "purpose": "The code provides a function to retrieve stock splits calendar data from an external API, with input parameters for filtering by ticker, country, and date range.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: ticker, country, startDate, endDate, output_type; also, global variable glob.apikey and internal functions fn.isStringOrList, fn.stringOrList, fn.checkDates, fn.dataRequest.",
  "sinks": "The function constructs an API URL and makes an HTTP request via fn.dataRequest. The API key is accessed via glob.apikey. No direct untrusted data execution or system modification is observed.",
  "flows": "User provides input parameters; code constructs API URL; the URL includes the API key from glob.apikey; request is made through fn.dataRequest.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets within the code itself; API key accessed via glob.apikey could be external. The code modifies the SSL context to disable verification, which is insecure but not malicious per se. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an unverified SSL context to bypass SSL verification, which reduces security but is common for development or troubleshooting. It constructs a URL for an external API, appending user-controlled parameters. The API key is fetched from a module variable, which could be externally configured; if glob.apikey is maliciously set or absent, it could affect request integrity. The code relies on internal functions for input validation and URL construction. No data exfiltration, malicious commands, or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a straightforward data retrieval function with a potentially insecure SSL setup but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a data retrieval function for stock splits with no obvious malicious behavior. The only security concern is the disabling of SSL verification, which could expose the request to man-in-the-middle attacks but does not indicate malicious intent. No malware or sabotage is evident.",
