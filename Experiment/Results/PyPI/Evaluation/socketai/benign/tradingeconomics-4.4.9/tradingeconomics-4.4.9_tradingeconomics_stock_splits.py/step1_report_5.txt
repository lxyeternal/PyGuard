    "Potentially insecure handling of startDate and endDate via checkDates without validation shown",
    "No explicit input sanitization or validation for parameters"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code constructs an API URL based on user inputs, appending either ticker or country data, along with an API key. It disables SSL verification, which can expose to man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if the external URL or the environment is compromised. The API key is obtained from a global variable without validation, which could lead to misuse if the key is compromised or misconfigured. Input parameters are passed through functions but their security impact depends on fn's implementation; no explicit validation is shown. The URL is then used in a data request function, which makes an external network request. No evidence of malicious code or backdoors was found. The disabling of SSL verification is concerning from a security standpoint, but it appears intended for development or testing, not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a typical API wrapper with no malicious behavior, but the SSL handling could introduce security risks if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as an API client to fetch stock splits data, with some security concerns related to SSL verification disabling and use of global API key. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors. The overall security risk is low, but the insecure SSL configuration should be addressed in production environments.",
