  "purpose": "Provides a function to retrieve stock splits calendar data from an external API, with configurable parameters for tickers, countries, and date range.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (glob.apikey), function parameters (ticker, country, startDate, endDate, output_type), and external modules (ssl, functions, glob).",
  "sinks": "Constructs a URL with parameters and API key, then calls fn.dataRequest, which likely performs an HTTP request to the external API.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (ticker, country, dates) are validated and used to build an API URL with embedded query parameters and API key, then passed to fn.dataRequest for data retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Uses SSL context override to disable SSL verification, which could weaken security. The API key is retrieved from a global module variable without explicit security measures. The code constructs URLs dynamically based on input parameters, which could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted, but the inputs are validated via fn.isStringOrList. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to disable SSL verification by overriding ssl._create_default_https_context, which is a security concern as it can expose the connection to man-in-the-middle attacks. It dynamically constructs API URLs based on user input, but validation functions (fn.isStringOrList) are used to prevent injection. The API key is accessed from glob.apikey, which if exposed, could be a concern, but this is common in configuration modules. No malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access is present. The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper with some insecure SSL handling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API request wrapper with a notable security weakness due to disabling SSL verification, which could be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks. No malware or malicious behavior is evident. Overall, the code poses a security warning primarily because of SSL context modification but does not contain malicious intent.",
