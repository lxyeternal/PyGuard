{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves stock splits calendar data from an external API, based on user-provided parameters such as ticker symbols, country, and date range.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'ticker', 'country', 'startDate', 'endDate', 'output_type'. Also, environment variables or global state for 'glob.apikey'.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL 'linkAPI' used in 'fn.dataRequest' function, which likely performs an external HTTP request.",
  "flows": "User inputs ('ticker', 'country', date parameters) flow into URL construction. The URL, including API key from 'glob.apikey', flows into 'fn.dataRequest' to fetch data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ssl._create_unverified_https_context' to bypass SSL verification can be risky; reliance on 'glob.apikey' from global state without validation. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code evident. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an API request URL based on user input parameters, with conditions for 'ticker' and 'country'. It manages SSL context to potentially ignore SSL verification issues, which could be risky but not malicious per se. The API key is fetched from 'glob.apikey' and included in the request. No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Functions imported ('fn' and 'glob') are assumed to be legitimate. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious behavior, or hidden backdoors. The code's behavior appears consistent with standard API request handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client implementation for retrieving stock data. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or malware observed. The SSL context override could be a security concern if used improperly, but it is not inherently malicious. Overall, this code appears safe and legitimate.",
