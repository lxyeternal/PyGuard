  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any inconsistencies, errors, or overlooked issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code retrieves stock splits data via API, no malicious activity, SSL context override is risky but not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes the SSL context override and the use of 'glob.apikey'. It assigns a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk is rated at 0.2, reflecting the SSL override concern.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API request, no malicious intent, SSL override present.\n\n- **Assessment:** The malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis. The report emphasizes the potential security concern of SSL context modification but correctly states there's no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the insecure SSL context override, potential security weakness, but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The security risk is rated at 0.4, higher than previous reports, which is justified given the SSL verification bypass. Malware score remains 0, as no malicious code is present.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is valid. The elevated security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, notes SSL context override, API key handling, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is 0.4, consistent with the SSL issue. Malware remains 0.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correctly reasoned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the API client nature, SSL override, no malicious activity, low security risk.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report assigns a security risk of 0.3, which is reasonable given the SSL override concern. Malware score remains 0.\n\n- **Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code constructs URLs based on user input, manages SSL context, and uses an API key from a global variable. No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n\n- **Security concerns:** The main issue is the disabling of SSL verification, which is a known security weakness but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Risk scores:** The scores reflect the security implications appropriately, with higher concern for SSL override.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** I agree with 0 across all reports; no malicious code detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the SSL context override, a risk score around 0.3-0.4 is justified, which aligns with the reports.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 (due to SSL verification bypass)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code. They correctly identify the SSL override as a security concern but find no evidence of malicious behavior. The assigned scores are reasonable, and I concur with their assessments.",
