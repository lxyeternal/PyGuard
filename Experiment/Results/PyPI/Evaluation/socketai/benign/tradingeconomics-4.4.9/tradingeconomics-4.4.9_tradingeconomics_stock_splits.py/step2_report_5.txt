  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Functionality:** Retrieves stock splits data via an API, constructs URL based on user input, manages SSL context.\n- **Anomalies & Security Concerns:** Uses `ssl._create_unverified_https_context` to bypass SSL verification, which is insecure but not malicious. API key from `glob.apikey`—potentially sensitive, but no evidence of misuse.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low). Given the SSL bypass, a slight increase could be justified, but overall, the report's assessment seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard API call construction and SSL context override.\n- **Security concern:** Same SSL bypass.\n- **Malware:** None.\n- **Score:** 0.2, consistent with previous.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar structure, explicitly mentions the security weakness of disabling SSL verification.\n- **Security concern:** SSL context override.\n- **Malware:** None.\n- **Score:** 0.4, slightly higher due to emphasis on security weakness, which seems justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern, notes insecure SSL handling.\n- **Score:** 0.4, consistent with prior reports.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis, notes insecure SSL handling.\n- **Score:** 0.3, slightly lower, perhaps considering less emphasis on security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is a straightforward API client.\n- **Use of SSL bypass:** The consistent use of `ssl._create_unverified_https_context` is a security weakness, as it exposes to man-in-the-middle attacks. While not malicious, it is a security concern.\n- **API key handling:** The API key is stored in a global variable `glob.apikey`. If this variable is exposed or mishandled, it could lead to secret leakage, but no evidence of malicious code or secrets hardcoded.\n- **Obfuscation & Hidden Behavior:** No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.\n- **Assumptions & Potential Vulnerabilities:** The reports assume the SSL bypass is solely for convenience, which is valid, but it increases attack surface.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores for malware should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The security risk should be elevated from 0.2-0.4 to at least 0.5, considering the insecure SSL handling.\n- The overall code is a typical API wrapper, with the main concern being insecure SSL practices, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (moderate security concern due to SSL bypass)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard API client for stock data.\n- No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- The main security issue is disabling SSL verification, which could be exploited in certain attack scenarios.\n- The current scores are reasonable but could be slightly adjusted to reflect the SSL security weakness more accurately.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.5\n\nThis reflects a legitimate, non-malicious code with a notable security weakness that should be addressed but does not constitute malicious intent.",
