{
  "purpose": "Fetches stock splits data from an external API based on user parameters such as ticker, country, date range, and output type.",
  "sources": "User inputs (ticker, country, startDate, endDate), global API key (glob.apikey), SSL context override",
  "sinks": "Constructed API request URL, dataRequest function (likely network request)",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> API request via fn.dataRequest",
  "anomalies": "Use of ssl._create_unverified_https_context to disable SSL verification, reliance on global API key",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an API URL dynamically based on user inputs, appends an API key, and disables SSL verification for HTTPS requests. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The SSL override poses a security risk but is not malicious. The functions used are assumed legitimate. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The main concern is the insecure SSL handling, which could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks, but it does not constitute malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client with a security weakness related to SSL verification bypass. There is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be set at approximately 0.3 to reflect the security concern without implying malicious behavior.",
