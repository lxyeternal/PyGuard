  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations from the code:**\n\n- The code constructs URLs based on user input, incorporating an API key from a global variable.\n- It modifies the SSL context to disable verification (`ssl._create_unverified_https_context`), which is insecure but not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.\n- The functions called (`fn.isStringOrList`, `fn.stringOrList`, `fn.checkDates`, `fn.dataRequest`) are assumed to be legitimate.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; the code fetches stock splits data based on parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of SSL unverified context is noted as risky but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard API client with a security concern regarding SSL verification.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; safe overall.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable, given SSL issue)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the potential security risk of disabling SSL verification.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (consistent)  \n  - Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Highlights the SSL context override as a security weakness, not malicious.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.4 (slightly higher, acknowledging the SSL issue)  \n  - Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; the SSL override is a concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous, emphasizing insecure SSL handling.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.4 (consistent)  \n  - Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Valid; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Provides a detailed analysis similar to others, emphasizing SSL security concerns.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.3 (reasonable)  \n  - Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **SecurityRisk score:** While the SSL context override is a security concern, it is not malicious. The scores range from 0.2 to 0.4, which seems reasonable given the security implications.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (consistent across reports; no malware observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** Given the SSL context override and reliance on global API key, a **moderate risk** exists but not high. I would assign:\n\n  **Malware:** 0  \n  **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  **Risk:** 0.3 (moderate, mainly due to insecure SSL handling)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Issues present:** No malicious code or obfuscation. The main concern is insecure SSL handling (`ssl._create_unverified_https_context`), which can be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks but is not malicious per se.\n- **Scores:** The reports' scores are reasonable. I would suggest slightly lowering the security risk from 0.4 to 0.3 to reflect that it is a security weakness, not an active threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.3\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: the code is a typical API client with a security weakness but no malicious intent.",
