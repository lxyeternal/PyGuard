  "purpose": "Establish and maintain a WebSocket connection to Trading Economics for real-time data streaming.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data like 'glob.apikey' for authentication, and it receives incoming messages via the WebSocket connection.",
  "sinks": "Processes incoming WebSocket messages in a user-provided callback; potential risk if the callback is malicious or insecure.",
  "flows": "The code builds a WebSocket URL with an API key, connects to the server, subscribes to events, and forwards messages to the callback function. Reconnection logic is implemented in case of closure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials other than usage of 'glob.apikey' from an external module; no suspicious code obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behavior observed. SSL certificate verification is disabled, which could pose security risks, but not malicious intent per se.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a WebSocket client to connect to a trading data stream. It uses threading to handle message processing and reconnection. The API key is externally supplied via the 'glob' module, which is typical for configuration management. The code disables SSL verification ('cert_reqs': ssl.CERT_NONE), which is insecure but not malicious. The reconnection logic is straightforward. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious code. The only concern is insecure SSL handling and reliance on external callback functions. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate WebSocket client with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard WebSocket client implementation for data streaming. It does not contain malicious behavior but has insecure SSL verification which could be exploited if connected to malicious or compromised servers. No signs of sabotage or malware are present.",
