{
  "purpose": "Establishes and maintains a WebSocket connection to a trading economics data stream, subscribing to specific events and handling message processing.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from glob.apikey; reads subscribed events from glob._event; reads messages from WebSocket stream.",
  "sinks": "Sends subscription requests via WebSocket; executes user-provided message handler; reconnects by calling start_socket and restart functions.",
  "flows": "On connection open, subscribes to events; on message, passes data to user handler; on error or close, may restart connection based on functions provided.",
  "anomalies": "Uses ssl.CERT_NONE, which disables SSL certificate verification, potentially exposing to man-in-the-middle attacks; relays restart functions without validation; global mutable state for restart functions.",
  "analysis": "The code connects to a trading data stream via WebSocket, subscribing to specified events. It handles errors, closures, and reconnections with threading. Use of ssl.CERT_NONE is a security risk as it disables SSL validation, making the connection susceptible to interception. The reliance on global variables for restart functions and dynamic thread creation could introduce stability issues but do not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data leaks are present. The code lacks obfuscation or malicious payloads; its main concern is insecure SSL handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for data streaming from a trusted source but contains a security risk by disabling SSL certificate verification, which could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage; however, the insecure SSL configuration warrants caution.",
