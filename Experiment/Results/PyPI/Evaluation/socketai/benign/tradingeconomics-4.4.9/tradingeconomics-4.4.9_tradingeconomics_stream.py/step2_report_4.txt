  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Connects to a WebSocket endpoint (`wss://stream.tradingeconomics.com`) with an API key from `glob.apikey`.\n- Subscribes to events listed in `glob._event`.\n- Uses threading for message handling and reconnection.\n- Disables SSL certificate verification (`sslopt={\"cert_reqs\": ssl.CERT_NONE}`), which is insecure.\n- Implements reconnection logic with no limit.\n- Uses dynamic function assignments for restart logic.\n- No hardcoded credentials beyond the API key.\n- No obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Insecure SSL (`ssl.CERT_NONE`), no malicious behavior, no backdoors.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (low), malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the main concern is SSL insecurity, not malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; insecure SSL, standard reconnection, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3, malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; insecure SSL, standard reconnection, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.4, malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; security concern is SSL, not malware.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; insecure SSL, no malicious code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3, malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same; insecure SSL, no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.3, malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code analysis; no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** The main concern across all reports is the insecure SSL configuration (`ssl.CERT_NONE`). While this is a security vulnerability, it does not constitute malicious activity.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- The **malware scores** are appropriately zero; no malicious code is present.\n- The **security risk scores** are moderate (around 0.3-0.4). Given the consistent insecure SSL handling, this is justified, but it does not elevate to high risk unless exploited.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (due to insecure SSL, which is a security concern but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard WebSocket client with insecure SSL configuration. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The primary security concern is the insecure SSL verification, which could be exploited in a man-in-the-middle attack, but this does not constitute malware or sabotage.\n\n**Recommendations:** Improve SSL security by verifying certificates, but no malicious activity is present based on the current code.",
