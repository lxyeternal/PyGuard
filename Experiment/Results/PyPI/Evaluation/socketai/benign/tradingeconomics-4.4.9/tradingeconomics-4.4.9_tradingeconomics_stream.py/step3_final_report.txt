{
  "purpose": "Establishes a WebSocket connection to Trading Economics' data stream, subscribes to events, and manages reconnections with threading, using an API key from external globals.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from glob.apikey, subscribes to events in glob._event, receives messages via WebSocket callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Processes incoming messages via user-defined callbacks; no direct data sinks or leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Source: glob.apikey and glob._event; flows through WebSocket subscription and message callbacks; no external data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Disables SSL certificate verification (sslopt={'cert_reqs': ssl.CERT_NONE}), uses global mutable state for callbacks and restart functions, employs threading for message handling and reconnection.",
  "analysis": "The code connects to a trusted WebSocket endpoint, subscribes to events, and handles reconnections with threading. It relies on external globals for configuration, which could be manipulated but does not indicate malicious intent. The disabling of SSL verification is a security vulnerability but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. No payloads or backdoors are detected. The main security concern is the insecure SSL setup, which could be exploited via man-in-the-middle attacks, but this does not constitute malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard WebSocket client with insecure SSL handling. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage. The primary issue is the insecure SSL configuration, which should be fixed to prevent MITM attacks. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
