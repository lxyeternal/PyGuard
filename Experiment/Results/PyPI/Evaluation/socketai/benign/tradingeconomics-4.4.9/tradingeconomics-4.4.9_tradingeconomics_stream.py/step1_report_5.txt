{
  "purpose": "Establishes and manages a WebSocket connection to Trading Economics data stream for real-time updates.",
  "sources": "Reading from websocket connection, reading global variables (glob.apikey, glob._event), input parameters for callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Sending subscription messages over WebSocket, potentially executing callback functions, possibly executing code via callbacks.",
  "flows": "On open, subscribes to topics using API key; on message, processes data via callback; on close, attempts reconnect; on error, logs error.",
  "anomalies": "Uses SSL with 'cert_reqs' set to CERT_NONE, which disables SSL certificate verification, potentially insecure. No explicit hardcoded credentials visible, but reliance on 'glob.apikey' stored externally. Callback functions are stored in a list and invoked dynamically, which can be risky if manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a WebSocket connection to a specified URL, subscribing to topics based on global variables. SSL certificate verification is disabled, which is a security concern. The reconnect logic is straightforward, utilizing threading for callbacks. No malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors detected. Usage of threading and dynamic callbacks may introduce risks if external code manipulates the callback functions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity observed. The design appears typical for a real-time data stream handler; however, disabling SSL verification reduces security posture. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a WebSocket client for real-time data streaming, with typical implementation patterns. The main security concern is disabling SSL verification, which could be exploited if man-in-the-middle attacks occur. No malicious intent or malware indications are detected. Overall, the code appears benign but with a security warning due to SSL configuration.",
