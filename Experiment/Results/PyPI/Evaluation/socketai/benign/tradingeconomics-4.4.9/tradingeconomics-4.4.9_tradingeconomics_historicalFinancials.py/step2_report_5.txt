  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches financial data, modifies SSL context to disable verification, relies on external modules (`fn`, `glob`), no hardcoded secrets, no malicious behavior observed. The security risk is moderate due to SSL handling.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code does disable SSL verification, which is a security concern but not malicious per se.\n  - No hardcoded secrets or malware indicators.\n  - External dependencies could be manipulated but are not inherently malicious.\n  - Malware score: **0** (no malware detected).\n  - Security risk score: **0.4** (moderate, due to SSL context override).\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The overall risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on external API key, URL construction, SSL context override, and reliance on external modules.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No malicious activity; standard API request code.\n  - Disabling SSL verification remains a security concern.\n  - External API key stored in `glob.apikey` is typical but could be a risk if compromised.\n  - Malware score: **0**.\n  - Security risk: **0.3** (low to moderate).\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent. The score appears reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API client code, no malicious activity, reliance on external modules, disables SSL verification.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No signs of malware.\n  - SSL context override is a security concern but not malicious.\n  - External dependencies and API key management are typical.\n  - Malware score: **0**.\n  - Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion matches the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, straightforward API request construction, no malicious behavior, external API key.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No malware detected.\n  - SSL context override is insecure but not malicious.\n  - External dependencies and API key management are standard.\n  - Malware score: **0**.\n  - Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on SSL context override, external configuration, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No malware or obfuscation.\n  - SSL override is insecure but not malicious.\n  - External API key management is typical.\n  - Malware score: **0**.\n  - Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern across reports is the disabling of SSL verification (`ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_https_context`). This practice exposes the connection to man-in-the-middle attacks but is not malicious. The scores range from 0.2 to 0.4, which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code's purpose is legitimate: fetching financial data via an API.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The primary security concern is the insecure SSL handling, which warrants a moderate risk score.\n- External dependencies and API key management are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear and readable)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.3** (due to insecure SSL context override, which could be exploited in a man-in-the-middle attack)\n\nThese scores reflect the code's benign purpose but acknowledge the security concern related to SSL handling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code's behavior. The main security concern is the insecure SSL context override, which should be addressed but does not constitute malware or obfuscation.",
