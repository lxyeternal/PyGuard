  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, reasoning, and scoring, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a data-fetching utility that constructs URLs with user parameters and an API key, then retrieves data via an external function `fn.dataRequest`.\n- The API key is stored in an external module `glob`, not hardcoded.\n- The code modifies SSL context to disable verification (`ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_https_context`), which is insecure.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.\n- External dependencies (`fn`, `glob`) are used without visible validation, but this is common in such scripts.\n- The main security concern is the insecure SSL context override, which could expose data to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n---\n\n### **Report-by-Report Review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; fetches financial data, with proper parameter handling.\n- **Anomalies:** SSL verification disabled; reliance on external modules.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent; moderate security risk due to SSL override.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.4 (reasonable).\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. The SSL issue justifies a moderate risk score, but no malware is present.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Similar to Report 1; accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** SSL context override; external dependencies.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity; security concern remains the same.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3 (reasonable).\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with prior; no malware, just SSL security concern.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Same pattern; accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** SSL override; external dependencies.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent; security risk low.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; no malware, low security risk.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** SSL override; reliance on external modules.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard API client.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent; no malware, minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate.\n- **Anomalies:** SSL override; external API key.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity; just a typical API client with a security concern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct; no malware, security concern due to SSL.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment & Final Scores**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports indicate no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are correct.\n- **Security Risk:** The primary concern is the use of `ssl._create_unverified_https_context`, which disables SSL verification and exposes data to man-in-the-middle attacks. While this is a security vulnerability, it is not malware or malicious code.\n\n**Proposed final scores:**\n\n| Aspect             | Score  | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No evidence of malicious code or behavior.                  |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0.4     | Due to insecure SSL context override, a moderate security concern. |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n- The code is a legitimate data retrieval utility for financial data.\n- No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- The main security concern is the insecure SSL context override, which could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks.\n- The external dependencies and API key handling are typical for such scripts but should be reviewed for trustworthiness.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The security risk score should be around 0.4, reflecting the SSL security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future analysis uncovers external modules (`fn`, `glob`) with malicious code, or if SSL override is used maliciously, these scores should be revisited.",
