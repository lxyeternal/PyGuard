  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches financial data, disables SSL verification, relies on external modules, no malware or obfuscation, moderate security risk due to SSL.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with no malicious activity observed.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — justified by the insecure SSL context override, which exposes to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The SSL context override is a security concern but not malicious. The code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the insecure SSL context, external dependencies, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 — still due to SSL override, slightly lower, perhaps reflecting slightly less emphasis on other issues.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No evidence of malware; the SSL issue remains the main concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard API client, no malicious activity, reliance on external modules and API key, SSL context override.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to SSL.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, straightforward API request construction, no malicious activity, external dependencies, SSL override.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—API data fetch, external modules, no malicious activity, SSL context override.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, code is clear.\n\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated due to the use of `ssl._create_unverified_https_context` to disable SSL verification, which is a known security vulnerability but not malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Reasoning:\n\n- The code's primary security concern is the disabling of SSL verification, which can expose data to man-in-the-middle attacks. However, this is a configuration choice, not malicious code.\n\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- External dependencies and API key handling are standard for such scripts but do introduce some trust assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.3 — due to insecure SSL context override, which is a moderate security concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The overall security posture is acceptable for a data retrieval utility, with the main concern being the insecure SSL context override. If this code were to be hardened, removing or securing SSL verification would be advisable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign with moderate security concerns. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
