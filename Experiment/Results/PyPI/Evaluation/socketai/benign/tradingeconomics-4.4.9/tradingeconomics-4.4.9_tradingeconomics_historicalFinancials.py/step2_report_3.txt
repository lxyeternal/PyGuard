  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security issues, and consistency of the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code fetches financial data, disables SSL verification, and relies on external modules (`fn`, `glob`). No hardcoded secrets or malware behaviors are observed. The main concern is the insecure SSL context override.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious activity detected; code is primarily data retrieval with insecure SSL handling.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4  \n  *Justification:* Disabling SSL verification is a significant security concern, as it exposes data to man-in-the-middle attacks, but it does not constitute malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** The score aligns with the analysis. The SSL override is a security flaw but not malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the disabling of SSL verification, external API key in `glob`, and reliance on external functions. No malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malware activity; primarily data fetching with security concerns.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3  \n  *Justification:* Same SSL issue; slightly lower because of possibly better validation.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Confidence:** 0.75\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous, reasonable scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—constructs URL, disables SSL verification, uses external modules, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No evidence of malicious code.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* SSL override remains the main concern.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score is appropriate; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard API request construction, reliance on external modules, disables SSL verification, no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malware observed.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* SSL issue, but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—constructs URL, external API key, disables SSL verification, no malware.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious activity.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2  \n  *Justification:* SSL context override is the main concern.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behaviors. The code is a legitimate API client with insecure SSL handling but no malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, matching the clear code structure.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.4, primarily due to the SSL context override, which is a known security flaw but not malware.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Evaluation:**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0.2** — The main concern is disabling SSL verification, which is a security flaw but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The code's main security concern is the insecure SSL context override, which should be addressed, but it does not constitute malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No evidence of malicious behavior                            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Clear code, no obfuscation                                   |\n| Security Risk      | 0.2     | SSL verification disabled; security best practices compromised |\n\nLet me know if you'd like further detailed analysis or recommendations.",
