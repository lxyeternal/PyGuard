  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data-fetching utility with a significant security concern due to disabling SSL verification. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main risk stems from insecure SSL handling, which should be addressed, but the code itself is benign."
