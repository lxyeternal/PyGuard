  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- Purpose: Fetch historical financial data via API, with parameters for symbol, category, dates, and output format.\n- Data flow: User inputs → URL construction → data request via external function.\n- Security concerns: SSL context override (disabling verification), reliance on external modules (`fn`, `glob`) for critical operations, and external API key management.\n- No hardcoded secrets or malware signatures are visible.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** No malware; main concern is insecure SSL context.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.4, Obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** SSL override is insecure but not malicious; external dependencies are a concern but not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code. The SSL context override is a security risk but not malware. External dependencies are typical but could be exploited if compromised. The report's low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing SSL override and external dependencies.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.3, Obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning; no malicious activity, just insecure SSL.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent. The SSL override remains the main security concern, but no malicious intent is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Same as above; no malicious behavior, standard API client.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** Similar points; reliance on external modules and SSL override are security issues but not malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The low malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Again, a standard API request module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; reliance on external API key and modules is typical.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe conclusion aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar to others; no malicious activity, main concern is insecure SSL context.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Obfuscated=0\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; SSL override is a security concern but not malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code and other reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- **Presence of malware:** None of the reports find evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Security risks:** All highlight the insecure SSL context override, which is a security concern but not malware.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **External dependencies:** Reliance on external modules (`fn`, `glob`) introduces potential attack vectors if those modules are compromised, but no direct malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** **0.2–0.4** — The main issue is disabling SSL verification, which exposes the connection to man-in-the-middle attacks, but this is a common insecure practice rather than malicious.\n\n**Recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Security risk:** **0.3** (moderate, due to SSL override)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate data-fetching utility with security concerns primarily related to SSL verification practices. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The external dependencies and SSL handling should be reviewed, but the core logic is benign.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.3**",
