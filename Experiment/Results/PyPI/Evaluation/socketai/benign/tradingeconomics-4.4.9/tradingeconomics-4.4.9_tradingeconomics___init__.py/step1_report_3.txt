{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports for various modules related to Trading Economics data API, enabling users to query economic and financial data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version information from sys.version_info and imports modules conditionally based on Python version. It also imports multiple functions from local modules (historicalDB, historical, calendar, forecasts, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process or execute untrusted data directly. It primarily performs static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and functions, with no dynamic execution or data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward module import statements. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code are present. The conditional import based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script sets a Python version flag and conditionally imports modules accordingly. The modules imported are likely part of the package, and no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing occurs in this snippet. The structure and content appear typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module loader, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. No suspicious code patterns, such as hidden code, secret credentials, or malicious commands, are evident. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured import mechanism for a data API package.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It functions as a conditional import setup for a Python package, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected.",
