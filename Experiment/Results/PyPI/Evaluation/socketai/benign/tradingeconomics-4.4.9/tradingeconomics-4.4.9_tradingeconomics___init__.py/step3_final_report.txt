{
  "purpose": "This package provides access to Trading Economics API data through various modules and functions, facilitating data retrieval and analysis.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, conditional on Python version, importing functions from multiple modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no network activity, no file operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of version-dependent import statements organizing module access. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's initialization module. The security risk score assigned in the original reports, particularly the 0.1 in report 5, is unwarranted given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious, non-obfuscated import setup for a Python package. It poses no security threat or supply chain risk. The minimal security risk score in report 5 should be adjusted to zero for consistency.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
