{
  "purpose": "The package facilitates querying various economic and financial data APIs for Trading Economics clients.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions based on Python version, primarily importing from local modules (e.g., historicalDB, historical, calendar, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; code primarily performs module imports and version-based conditional imports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input; only module imports based on version detection.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard version-based conditional imports; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. No obfuscation or dynamic execution is present. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward import statements conditioned on the Python version (2.x vs 3.x). It imports various modules related to financial data, with no indication of data processing, network activity, or malicious behavior. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The structure and format are typical for a modular Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import setup for a Python package that interfaces with multiple APIs. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code snippet.",
