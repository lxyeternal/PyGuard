{
  "purpose": "The package provides an interface to various Trading Economics APIs for data retrieval related to economic indicators, markets, news, and other financial data.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load functions from multiple modules based on Python version; primarily importing API access functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network or file operations shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only imports functions without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs conditional imports based on Python version but contains no suspicious or unusual code structures, obfuscated patterns, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of conditional import statements to support both Python 2 and Python 3. It segregates module imports accordingly. No dynamic code execution, eval, exec, or reflective programming techniques are present. No network, file, or sensitive data handling occurs here. The purpose appears to be straightforward API function importing, with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no anomalies or obfuscation patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import setup for a Python package providing access to Trading Economics APIs. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. It appears to be a legitimate data access layer with no security risks identified.",
