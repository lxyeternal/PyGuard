{
  "purpose": "To provide a Python package that facilitates querying various Trading Economics API endpoints for data retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code imports multiple modules and functions depending on Python version, primarily from local package files or relative modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects; the code mainly imports functions for data access.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static, and no dynamic execution is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution. The code structure is typical for a package entry point or module index.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a module docstring explaining its purpose. It then checks Python version and imports numerous functions from local modules accordingly. All imports are static and straightforward, with no dynamic execution, code injection, or suspicious behavior observed. The code does not include any network activity, data processing, or data leaks within this fragment. There are no signs of backdoors, hidden malicious code, or obfuscated segments. The structure is consistent with a typical Python package's __init__.py or main module, used to organize and expose functionality. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate, standard for a data retrieval package, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard package import structure for a Python library designed for data access from Trading Economics. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on static code inspection. The code's purpose is to organize imports for the package's functionality, and there are no suspicious elements present.",
