{
  "purpose": "Provides import statements for various modules related to Trading Economics API data retrieval, supporting both Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Imports modules depending on Python version; no external input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only contains imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns. Conditional import structure based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script is solely composed of import statements for a set of modules that facilitate data access from the Trading Economics API. It uses version checking to determine the import style for Python 2 or 3, which is a common pattern. No data input, network connections, or execution of untrusted code is present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The structure is straightforward, focusing on modular imports for API functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import loader for a Python package that interfaces with Trading Economics data. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. It solely manages imports based on Python version with no suspicious activities.",
