  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Static import statements, straightforward structure.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.  \n- **Comments:** Accurate and consistent with code content.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; standard import setup, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.  \n- **Comments:** Consistent and reasonable.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; no malicious or obfuscated code, just conditional imports based on Python version.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.  \n- **Comments:** Accurate reflection of the code's simplicity and intent.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, standard import statements with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.  \n- **Comments:** Correct assessment.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern; straightforward, version-dependent imports, no malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — *questionable*.  \n- **Comments:** The securityRisk score is slightly above zero, but the code contains only static import statements with no evidence of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious intent. The small non-zero score might reflect a conservative stance, but given the code's content, it seems unwarranted.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code is purely import statements with no network, file, or data processing.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, as there's no obfuscation or hidden code.  \n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, except Report 5, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's nature, a risk score higher than 0 is unwarranted. It does not pose any security threat or supply chain risk.  \n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities, backdoors, or risky behaviors evident.  \n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe code is a standard module import setup, common in Python packages, with no dynamic code execution, no secrets, no obfuscation, and no network activity. The small security risk score in Report 5 appears to be an overestimate; I would set it to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0              |\n\nThis aligns with the static code analysis and the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements.",
