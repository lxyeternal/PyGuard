  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements conditioned on Python version.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is to organize module imports for a package providing access to Trading Economics APIs.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard API access interface.\n- **Findings:** Static imports, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, straightforward.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Facilitates querying Trading Economics endpoints.\n- **Findings:** Static imports, no dynamic code.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, API data retrieval.\n- **Findings:** Version-based conditional imports, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Typical pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Data retrieval support.\n- **Findings:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious elements.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, just imports.\n- **Analysis:** The only difference is a SecurityRisk score of 0.1, which seems arbitrary.\n- **Justification:** Given the code, a risk score of 0.1 is not justified; the code is benign.\n- **Score Adjustment:** Recommend setting SecurityRisk to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **SecurityRisk:** For report 5, it should be 0 instead of 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, static import setup for a Python package.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- The only questionable score is in report 5's SecurityRisk, which should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The only adjustment needed is to set the SecurityRisk score in report 5 to 0, reflecting the absence of any real security concern.",
