  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It’s a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python module.\n- Reads `README.rst` with utf-8 encoding.\n- Uses `setuptools` to define package metadata, dependencies (`pandas`, `websocket-client`), and package inclusion rules.\n- No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or external data processing.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All emphasize that the script is a standard setup routine, reading a local README file, defining package metadata, dependencies, and no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- They correctly note the absence of hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Any anomalies or concerns?**  \nNone. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  0 — code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  0 — no security risks are present in a standard setup script.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a typical `setup.py` script with no suspicious elements, no external or untrusted data, and no malicious intent. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is entirely benign, standard packaging code, and poses no security threat.",
