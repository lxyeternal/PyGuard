{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'tradingeconomics', specifying metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion rules for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for long description; package metadata and dependencies specified directly within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input; no network connections, file modifications, or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading the README file content for the long description; no external data processing or transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present. All code pertains to standard package setup routines.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for setup, reads a README file to include as long description, and calls setup() with metadata and dependency info. No code executes external commands, handles user input, or performs any operations beyond package configuration. No suspicious or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
