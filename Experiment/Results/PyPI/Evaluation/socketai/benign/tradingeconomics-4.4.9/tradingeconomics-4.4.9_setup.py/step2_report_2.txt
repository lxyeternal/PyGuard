  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module.\n- No suspicious behaviors, external data flows, or anomalies are identified.\n- The code reads a local README file with UTF-8 encoding, which is typical.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.\n- Dependencies ('pandas' and 'websocket-client') are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or external data handling beyond static file reading.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- The security risk score is also 0, aligning with the lack of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the clarity and standard nature of the code.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- There are no signs of supply chain attacks, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Given the complete lack of suspicious elements, I concur with the provided scores and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores reflect this accurately.",
