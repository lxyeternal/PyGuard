  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'tradingeconomics' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output channels; no external data handling other than reading a static file.",
  "flows": "Reads README.rst file content during setup, no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a local README file with utf-8 encoding and defines package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for a setup.py file. No external input processing, dynamic code execution, or suspicious code is present. The dependencies are standard packages ('pandas' and 'websocket-client') and the setup parameters are conventional. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and follows standard packaging practices.",
