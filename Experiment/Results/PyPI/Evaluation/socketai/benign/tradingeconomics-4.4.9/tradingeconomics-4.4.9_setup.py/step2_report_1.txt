  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the provided code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- Reads a local README.rst file with UTF-8 encoding for the long description.\n- Uses `setuptools` to define package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion.\n- Dependencies are `pandas` and `websocket-client`.\n- No dynamic code execution, external input processing, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior?** No.\n- **Any anomalies or security risks?** No.\n- **External data flows or untrusted inputs?** No.\n- **Obfuscation or hardcoded secrets?** No.\n\n**All reports agree** that this is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n#### Malware Score:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or trojans.\n\n#### Obfuscated Score:\n- All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n#### Security Risk Score:\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- They correctly identify the code as standard and safe.\n- No changes needed in their scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- Since the code reads a local file and performs package setup, there are no indications of supply chain threats.\n- The dependencies are common and do not introduce risk.\n- The code is typical for Python packaging.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the current scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action or concern is necessary. The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.",
