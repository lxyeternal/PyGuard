  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tradingeconomics' Python package, providing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.rst' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or insecure data handling detected.",
  "flows": "File reading operation flows from disk to string variable; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns observed. All operations are standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard 'setuptools' to define package metadata, dependencies, and description. It reads a local README file for the long description, which is a common practice. No external data input, command execution, or network operations are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is identified. The code structure and dependencies are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks identified.",
