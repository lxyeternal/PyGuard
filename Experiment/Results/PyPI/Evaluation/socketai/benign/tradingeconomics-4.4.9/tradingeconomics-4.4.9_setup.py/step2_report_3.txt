  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module.\n- The code reads a local README file with utf-8 encoding.\n- It uses `setuptools.setup()` with typical package metadata and dependencies.\n- No external input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- Dependencies are standard (`pandas`, `websocket-client`).\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malware indications are present.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets are consistent with typical `setup.py` files.\n- No anomalies, data leaks, or malicious code are present.\n- The reports' confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware scores are appropriately 0; there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the findings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is a straightforward, benign setup script with no security issues.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nAll evidence points to this being a legitimate, standard setup script with no signs of supply chain threats or malicious intent.",
