{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'tradingeconomics'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leaks or external data manipulations are evident.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script only reads a local file and sets up package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, defines a function to read a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script. No external data inputs are processed during runtime, and there are no network calls, code injections, or credential usages. The dependencies are standard packages (pandas and websocket-client) and are declared securely. There is no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
