{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'tradingeconomics'. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion rules, facilitating distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long description; uses static package metadata; specifies dependencies 'pandas' and 'websocket-client'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Reads local README file; passes static metadata and dependencies to setuptools; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard practices; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional 'setup.py' script that reads a local README file with UTF-8 encoding, defines package metadata, dependencies, and exclusions. It employs standard Python packaging practices without dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The dependencies are common and do not introduce security concerns. The code structure is clear, and the absence of obfuscation or hardcoded secrets indicates a benign intent. The reports' assessments align with the code's straightforward nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, all of which are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
