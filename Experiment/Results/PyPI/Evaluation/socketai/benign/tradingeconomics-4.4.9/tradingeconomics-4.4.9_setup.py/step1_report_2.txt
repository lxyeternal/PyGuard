{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'tradingeconomics' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file from the package directory for long description content.",
  "tails": "None; the code primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there is no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only reads static files and defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The script does not contain hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. It reads a README file and sets up package parameters.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a function to read the README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for a Python package setup file. No user input is read, no untrusted data is processed, and there are no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
