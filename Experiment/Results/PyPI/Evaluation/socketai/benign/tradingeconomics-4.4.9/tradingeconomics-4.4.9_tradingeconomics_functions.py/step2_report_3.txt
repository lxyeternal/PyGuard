  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their findings, the validity of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n**Summary:** The code is utility functions for data validation, URL construction, and web requests. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, using standard libraries.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The low security risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are reasonable.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1; functions for date validation, URL building, API requests. No malicious behavior, no secrets or obfuscation.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Again, standard libraries and practices.\n- Minimal error handling with print statements, but this is benign.\n- No suspicious code or malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n**Summary:** Utility functions for data validation, URL construction, API requests. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious payloads.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly higher risk score (0.2) compared to previous reports, perhaps due to minimal error handling with print statements.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are consistent and reasonable.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n**Summary:** Similar utility functions, with no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious code.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The commented-out credential validation code is inactive, so no risk.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n**Summary:** Utility functions for data validation, URL creation, and API requests. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code relies on external inputs for URL construction, but validation is minimal.\n- No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the context.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Scores are justified and appropriate.** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is accurate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), but all are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My own assessment:**  \nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is standard utility functions for data validation and API interaction, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low risk scores are justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current scores.  \n- Emphasize that the code should be used with proper input validation in production, but no immediate security concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my final estimates:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**          | **0**              | **0.1–0.2** |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and my analysis.",
