  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation, URL construction, and API data retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for dates, credentials, URL segments, and user-provided data for URL construction.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests via urlopen, reading responses, and potential URL manipulations based on user input.",
  "flows": "Input data (dates, credentials, URL parts) -> URL construction functions -> urlopen requests -> JSON parsing and data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; commented-out credential validation code, basic error handling with print statements, no input sanitization beyond simple checks.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries for URL handling, JSON parsing, and web requests. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity are evident. Input validation is minimal but does not indicate malicious intent. The functions perform straightforward data validation, URL assembly, and API calls. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The security risk is low, primarily due to external input reliance and minimal validation, but no active threats are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data validation and API interaction. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score remains at 0. The risk score could be slightly elevated due to minimal validation, but it remains within safe bounds.",
