  "purpose": "The code provides functions to query the Trading Economics Comtrade API for trade data, including country info, categories, historical data, and trade summaries, with options for output formats.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user input parameters such as 'country', 'symbol', 'category', 'type', and 'page_number', as well as internal variables like 'glob.apikey'. It also reads environment variables implicitly for API key.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via 'fn.dataRequest' function, which likely makes HTTP requests. Untrusted data flows from user input parameters into URL construction, including 'country', 'symbol', 'category', 'type', 'page_number', and 'glob.apikey'.",
  "flows": "User input parameters are incorporated into API URL strings; these URLs are passed to 'fn.dataRequest'. The API key is appended from 'glob.apikey'. Potential malicious flows include injection via 'country', 'category', or 'type' parameters if they are not properly sanitized.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are directly visible; the API key is fetched from 'glob.apikey'. No suspicious code injections, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present. Error handling is standard. The code imports modules without any obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly constructs API request URLs based on user inputs and internal variables, then calls a data request function to fetch data. The URL construction is straightforward, using 'quote()' to encode parameters. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The API key management relies on a global variable, which is typical. Error handling includes custom exceptions for login and parameters. No hidden or malicious code detected. The use of SSL context override is standard for unverified HTTPS requests. Overall, the code appears designed for data retrieval with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of API wrapper functions for fetching trade data, with input parameters directly influencing URL construction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. It appears to be legitimate application code intended for data analysis. The only minor concern is reliance on external API keys stored in a global variable, which is common but warrants secure handling in deployment.",
