The primary security issue is the insecure SSL context override, which should be addressed to prevent potential man-in-the-middle attacks. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malware are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3), mainly due to SSL handling. Improving SSL verification practices and validating inputs further would enhance security."
