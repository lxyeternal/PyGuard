{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve financial data and categories from an external API, formatting URLs and handling different input types for data retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (`symbol`, `country`, `category`, `output_type`) and the globally imported `glob.apikey`. External API URL construction occurs in multiple functions.",
  "sinks": "The `fn.dataRequest()` function calls, which likely perform network requests with constructed URLs. The API key is embedded directly into URLs, which could be sensitive if exposed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build API request URLs. These URLs are then passed to `fn.dataRequest()`, which performs network requests. The API key and parameters flow directly into the request.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes error handling that returns strings for login issues, but no immediate anomalies. URL construction appears standard, though the presence of a globally used API key embedded in URLs could be sensitive. No signs of code obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials other than `glob.apikey` which is assumed to be set externally. No data leakage, code injection, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple functions to fetch financial data from an API, building URLs dynamically based on user input. It uses conditional logic to manage parameters and URL encoding, and handles errors related to login state. The API key is obtained from `glob.apikey` and included in request URLs. No code segments perform unsafe operations like executing untrusted input, code injection, or data exfiltration. Network requests are delegated to `fn.dataRequest()`, which is assumed to handle security properly. Overall, the code appears to be a standard API client library with no malicious intent or security risks evident from static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API client for financial data retrieval with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses standard practices for URL construction and error handling. The only potential concern is the management of the API key, which is external to this code. Overall, the code poses no significant security threat.",
