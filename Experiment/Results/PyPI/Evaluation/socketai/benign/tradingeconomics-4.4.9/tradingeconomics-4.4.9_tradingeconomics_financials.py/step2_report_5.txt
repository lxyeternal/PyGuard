  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code constructs API URLs based on user inputs and an API key, then fetches data via `fn.dataRequest`. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or code injection detected. The primary concern is reliance on `glob.apikey` and minimal error handling.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity observed.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, considering external API key management and no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a straightforward API client, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard URL construction, use of API key, and data retrieval. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent; no malware detected.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — appropriate, given the reliance on external API key and standard practices.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code builds URLs with user inputs and API key, calls `fn.dataRequest`, and contains no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — accurate; no malware evident.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent with previous assessments.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid; the code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on URL construction, input validation, and external function calls. No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate; no malware.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — aligns with low risk.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; the code is a standard API client.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing URL building, use of API key, and safe data retrieval. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — matches the overall conclusion.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — reasonable, considering external API key handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is appropriate; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the code's behavior. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across all reports seem reasonable. The main concern is external API key management, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the analysis provided.\n\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n### Final personal estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to external API key management, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate API client for fetching financial data, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
