{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to fetch financial data and related information from the Trading Economics API, constructing URLs based on user inputs and environment variables.",
  "sources": "User parameters (symbol, country, category), environment variable glob.apikey, internal functions (fn.dataRequest), and external modules (glob, fn).",
  "sinks": "The constructed API URLs are passed to fn.dataRequest, which performs web requests to fetch data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and API key → URL construction → fn.dataRequest call → data retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets beyond the API key, no malicious code or backdoors. Error handling is minimal but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API request URLs based on user inputs and environment variables, then calls an external function to perform web requests. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The reliance on glob.apikey is standard but should be managed securely. The code is straightforward and typical for an API client. No suspicious signals or malicious payloads are present. The security risk is low, primarily due to external API key management and minimal input validation. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is approximately 0.2, consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward API client for fetching financial data. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
