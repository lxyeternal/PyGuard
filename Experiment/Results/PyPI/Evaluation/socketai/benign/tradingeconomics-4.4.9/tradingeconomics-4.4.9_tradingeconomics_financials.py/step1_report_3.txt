  "purpose": "This code provides functions to fetch financial data and related information from an external API (Trading Economics), with configurable parameters for symbols, countries, categories, and sectors.",
  "sources": [
    "glob.apikey: Reads API key for authentication.",
    "input parameters to functions (symbol, country, category, output_type): Read user inputs.",
    "fn.dataRequest: Calls external data request function, passing constructed URLs."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "fn.dataRequest: Potential data exfiltration or malicious data handling if the implementation is compromised.",
    "API URLs: Constructs URLs based on user input and API key, which could be manipulated if inputs are malicious."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "User input (symbol, country, category) -> URL construction -> fn.dataRequest call",
    "glob.apikey used in URL parameters -> external API request"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded secrets other than glob.apikey, which is expected to be set externally.",
    "No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
    "Error handling returns generic messages or raises exceptions without malicious payloads.",
    "Functions are mainly wrapping API requests with input validation."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code constructs API request URLs dynamically based on user inputs and an API key. It performs input validation for parameters like symbol, country, and category, and constructs URLs accordingly. The data is fetched via an external function fn.dataRequest, which is not detailed here. Error handling appears basic, providing messages or raising exceptions. There are no signs of code injection, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network connections beyond the intended API requests. The use of API keys and URL construction are standard, with no suspicious obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper for fetching financial data with no evident malicious intent. It relies on external inputs and constructs URLs accordingly, with no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The overall security risk is low.",
