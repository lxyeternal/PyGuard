  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes functions fetching data from Trading Economics API, relying on parameters, environment variables (`glob.apikey`), and internal functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** URL construction flows into `fn.dataRequest`.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets beyond `glob.apikey`. Error handling is minimal. No malicious code, no signs of sabotage.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate API client, low security risk. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity) — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation) — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to reliance on external API key and minimal error handling) — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API request construction, reliance on `glob.apikey`, and external function calls.  \n- No suspicious URL manipulation or malicious behavior.  \n- No hardcoded secrets other than the API key.  \n- Overall, straightforward data retrieval.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — consistent with low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on URL construction, input validation, and safe data fetching.  \n- No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.  \n- API key management is external.  \n- No malicious payloads or suspicious URL handling.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous, standard API wrapper functions.  \n- No malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors.  \n- Uses external `glob.apikey`.  \n- Error handling is basic but not malicious.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Reiterates the same pattern: URL construction, reliance on external API key, no malicious code, no obfuscation.  \n- No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a straightforward API client.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in the code snippets.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, primarily due to external dependencies (`glob.apikey`) and minimal error handling, but overall very low.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.2** (consistent with low but non-zero risk due to external API key management and minimal validation)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard API wrapper for fetching financial data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The minor risk stems from external dependencies and basic error handling, but these do not elevate the threat level significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure `glob.apikey` is securely managed and not exposed, and consider adding input validation to further reduce potential attack surface.",
