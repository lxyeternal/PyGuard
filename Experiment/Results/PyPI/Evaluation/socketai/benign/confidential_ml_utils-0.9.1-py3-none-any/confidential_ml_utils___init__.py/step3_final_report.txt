  "purpose": "Utility module providing confidential ML utilities, including constants, logging, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules and the static warnings.warn() call.",
  "sinks": "The warnings output, which is safe and standard.",
  "flows": "Static import statements and a single warning message; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static utility module that imports internal components and issues a deprecation warning. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The only runtime activity is a benign warning message. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The deprecation warning is standard and harmless. The current scoring accurately reflects its safe nature; minor adjustments to risk scores to zero could be considered but are not necessary.",
