  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal utility module for confidential ML utilities.\n- It imports constants, logging, exceptions, and issues a deprecation warning.\n- No malicious code, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice and not harmful.\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** None identified; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting very low security risk, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Anomalies:** None, apart from the deprecation warning, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n1. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**\n   - All reports assign obfuscated = 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n3. **Security Risk:**\n   - The highest is 0.1, mainly due to the deprecation warning. This is reasonable; warnings are non-security issues unless they contain malicious content, which they do not.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions are made about external data sources or untrusted inputs.\n   - The code is static, with only imports and a warning message.\n\n5. **Scores consistency:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and the code.\n   - The assigned scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** The current scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- **Justification for higher scores:** None needed; the code is safe.\n- **Potential improvements:** Not applicable; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, just the deprecation warning, which is standard)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent. The current scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple utility module with a deprecation warning, posing no security threat. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
