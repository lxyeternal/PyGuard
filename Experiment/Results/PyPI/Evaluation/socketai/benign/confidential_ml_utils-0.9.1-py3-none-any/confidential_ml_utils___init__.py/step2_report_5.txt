  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code consists solely of imports and a single warnings.warn() call.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice and does not introduce security risks.\n- No external data, user input, or sensitive information is involved.\n- The only potential concern is the deprecation warning, which is not a security issue but might be relevant in terms of maintenance or user experience.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.\n- The warning message is benign and standard.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The scores for malware and security risk are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The deprecation warning is appropriately issued.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low or zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for scores higher than 0.5:\n- No issues justify a higher risk or malware score.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and not malicious.\n- No suspicious code, data flow, or external interactions.\n\n### Potential inconsistencies:\n- The only minor point is the `securityRisk` score in report 3, which is 0.1 despite the code being safe. This could be slightly overestimated, but given the overall context, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the deprecation warning, but very low)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward utility module with no security risks or malicious behavior. The deprecation warning is standard and does not impact security. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to acknowledge the deprecation warning, but very minor)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
