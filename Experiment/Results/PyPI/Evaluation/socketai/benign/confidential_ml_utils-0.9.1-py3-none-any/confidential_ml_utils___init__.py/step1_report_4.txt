  "purpose": "Provides utilities for confidential machine learning, including constants, logging, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.constants, .logging, .exceptions), and a warnings call.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function could potentially display messages to users but does not pose a security risk.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly imports modules and issues a warning.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a deprecation warning indicating the package is outdated. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules related to constants, logging, and exception handling. It issues a deprecation warning advising users to switch to a new package. No user input, external data, or sensitive information handling is present. There are no signs of code obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The presence of internal imports and a deprecation message are typical and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as a utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module with a deprecation warning. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
