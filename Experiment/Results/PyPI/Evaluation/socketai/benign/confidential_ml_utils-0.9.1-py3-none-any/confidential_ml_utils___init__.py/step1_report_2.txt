{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility package for confidential machine learning operations, primarily providing imports and versioning information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's version, imports specific functions and constants from local modules, and issues a warning message.",
  "sinks": "The warning message is a non-structural output, not an untrusted data sink. No other significant sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks are evident in this static code. The code mainly performs imports and issues a warning.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable feature is the deprecation warning indicating the package is outdated since May 2021, but this is not malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules and constants, sets a version, and issues a deprecation warning guiding users to a newer package. There are no input sources, data processing, or external data flows. The warning is standard and benign. No suspicious code, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of imports and a deprecation warning. There are no signs of malware or security issues. The deprecation warning is informational, not malicious.",
