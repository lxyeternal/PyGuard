{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and constants for confidential machine learning workflows, primarily related to logging, constants, and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.constants, .logging, .exceptions), and the warnings.warn function call.",
  "sinks": "The warning message output could be considered a sink, but it is benign. No other untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and issues a deprecation warning.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hidden behaviors are observed. The warning message is straightforward and related to deprecation notice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules and issues a deprecation warning about the package, suggesting to switch to an alternative package. There are no dynamic executions, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code is minimal and standard for a library utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, contains no malicious behavior or suspicious activities. It is a standard utility module with a deprecation warning, which is normal and harmless.",
