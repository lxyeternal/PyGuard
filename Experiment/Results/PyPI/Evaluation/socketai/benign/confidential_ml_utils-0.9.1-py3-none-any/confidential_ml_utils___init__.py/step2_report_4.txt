  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code to verify the claims, evaluate the scoring, and ensure consistency.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code is a minimal utility module that imports constants, logging, and exception handling functions from local modules, sets a version, and issues a deprecation warning via `warnings.warn()`.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated code, or external data handling.\n- The only runtime behavior is issuing a deprecation warning, which is benign.\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code does not contain any security issues, malware, or anomalies.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and does not introduce security risks.\n- No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.\n- The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware or security risks.\n- The mention of deprecation warning and imports aligns with the code.\n- No false positives or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            | No malicious behavior, straightforward warning. |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Same reasoning; benign code. |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.1 (securityRisk) | Slightly elevated, but still benign; deprecation warning is harmless. |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            | No issues, purely utility code. |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Clear and safe utility code. |\n\n**Notable points:**\n- The `securityRisk` scores of 0.1 in some reports are slightly elevated but justified due to the presence of a warning message. However, warnings are non-structural and do not pose security risks.\n- Malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly assigned as 0. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly assigned as 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is benign, the risk scores should remain low, close to 0. The slight increase to 0.1 for some reports due to the deprecation warning is acceptable but could be considered overly cautious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are generally reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The risk scores could be uniformly set to 0, given the benign nature, unless the scoring system considers deprecation warnings as slightly risky.\n- The securityRisk score of 0.1 in some reports seems acceptable but could be lowered to 0, as the warning does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**My own scores based on the analysis:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code present)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk; deprecation warning is harmless)\n- **Malware score justification:** No malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score justification:** Code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score justification:** Only a deprecation warning, which is informational.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Final Estimate | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk | Notes |\n|------------------|---------|--------------|-------|--------|\n| **Scores**       | 0       | 0            | 0     | Fully benign, no security issues. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the current scores are appropriate, perhaps with slight adjustments to reflect zero risk more explicitly.",
