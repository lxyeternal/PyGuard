  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal utility module that imports constants, logging, exceptions, and issues a deprecation warning.\n- No user input, external data, or network activity is present.\n- The only runtime behavior is issuing a static deprecation warning.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and informational.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility for confidential ML utilities.\n- **Sources:** Imports and warnings.warn().\n- **Sinks:** Warning output is safe.\n- **Flows:** Static import and warning.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Safe, straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility package, version info, deprecation warning.\n- **Sources:** Imports, version setting, warnings.warn().\n- **Sinks:** Warning output is safe.\n- **Flows:** Static, no external data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Only deprecation notice.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The deprecation warning is standard, no risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility for ML, constants, logging, exceptions.\n- **Sources:** Imports, warnings.warn().\n- **Sinks:** Warning output safe.\n- **Flows:** Static, no data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Only deprecation message.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Note on securityRisk:** Slightly above zero. Since it's just a deprecation warning, a small score (0.1) is acceptable, though it could be 0. If no external risks are involved, this might be slightly overstated but not unreasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** ML utilities, constants, logging, exceptions.\n- **Sources:** Imports, warnings.warn().\n- **Sinks:** Warning benign.\n- **Flows:** Static.\n- **Anomalies:** Only deprecation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Note:** Similar to Issue 3, the small securityRisk score is acceptable but could be zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions, constants, deprecation warning.\n- **Sources:** Imports, warnings.warn().\n- **Sinks:** Warning output benign.\n- **Flows:** Static.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The only potential point of discussion is the small securityRisk score (0.1) in some reports, which seems to reflect the deprecation warning. Since the warning is static and does not process untrusted data, a score of 0 might be more appropriate, but 0.1 is still acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all, correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Should be 0 in all cases, as the code does not pose any security threat.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly over 0.9, possibly 1, since the code is straightforward and well-understood.\n- **Obfuscation:** Confirmed as 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Confidence |\n|---------|--------------|----------------|------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0              | 1          |\n\n**Summary:** The code is entirely safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The deprecation warning is standard and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The minor securityRisk scores could be adjusted to zero for precision, but their current values are acceptable.",
