  "purpose": "Provide confidential ML utilities and manage related constants, logging, and exceptions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.constants, .logging, .exceptions), and a warnings.warn call.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn call could potentially output messages, but it is not harmful or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and issues a warning message, with no further data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code uses standard import and warning functions. The warning message is static and informational.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of importing modules and issuing a deprecation warning via warnings.warn. No user input or untrusted data sources are processed. There are no suspicious activities such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The warning message is static, indicating deprecation and suggesting an alternative package. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a utility module with a deprecation notice. Overall, it appears safe with a very low malware or security threat potential.",
