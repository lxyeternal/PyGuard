  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal utility module that imports constants, logging, exceptions, and issues a deprecation warning.\n- No external or untrusted data sources are involved.\n- The only runtime behavior is issuing a static deprecation warning.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of deprecation warning**: All reports agree that the only active runtime behavior is the `warnings.warn()` call indicating deprecation. This is benign and standard.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **None identified**: The code appears straightforward, with no logical errors or security flaws.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Malware score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score**: Mostly 0, with some reports mentioning 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, a score of 0 is more appropriate. The minor mention of 0.1 seems unjustified.\n- **Risk score**: All reports assign 0 or very close to it, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- No reason exists to justify scores above 0.1, let alone 0.5, since there's no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The deprecation warning does not introduce any security risk.\n- The code does not process user input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code.\n- The import statements are from internal modules, which are standard for utility code.\n- The code's purpose is purely informational and supportive.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering the deprecation warning as a minor risk, but this is not justified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security issues. The deprecation warning is standard and harmless.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Reduce the security risk score to 0, as there's no evidence of security issues.\n- The report's current scores are reasonable but could be slightly lowered for security risk.\n\n**Final note:**  \nNo further action is necessary; the code is safe and well-understood.",
