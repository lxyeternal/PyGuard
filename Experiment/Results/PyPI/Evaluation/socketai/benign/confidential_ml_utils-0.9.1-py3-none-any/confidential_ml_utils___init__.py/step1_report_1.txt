{
  "purpose": "The code provides confidential machine learning utilities, including importing constants, logging, and exception handling functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.constants, .logging, .exceptions), and a warnings.warn() call.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() call outputs a deprecation warning message, which is generally safe and does not lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Code imports modules and executes warnings.warn() which outputs a message indicating deprecation and suggesting alternative packages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behavior. The warning message is straightforward and pertains to deprecation status.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules related to constants, logging, and exceptions, indicating utility functions. The only active runtime behavior is issuing a deprecation warning that guides users toward newer packages. No untrusted data sources, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard and safe, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with a deprecation warning. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities. Its purpose is to support ML utilities, and it simply notifies users about deprecation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is identified.",
