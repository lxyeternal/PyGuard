      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward log parsing utility with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain security issues. The 'assert False' appears to be a debugging artifact and should be removed or replaced for production. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2 due to potential runtime errors but no security threat. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use, with minor improvements recommended for robustness."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for confidential logging, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The main security consideration is the potential misuse of logger override capabilities, which could be exploited if the code is compromised or misused, but this does not constitute malware. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a slight security risk (~0.2) due to configuration flexibility."
