  "purpose": "Utilities for prefixing exception stack traces and obscuring exception messages for secure logging and privacy.",
  "sources": "Reads exception data from exception objects, sys.exc_info(), traceback objects, and exception attributes.",
  "sinks": "Prints formatted traceback and exception messages to stderr, then re-raises the scrubbed exception.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> exception attributes are scrubbed recursively -> formatted traceback is printed with prefix -> exception is re-raised.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. Exception attribute manipulation is for privacy/security, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to scrub sensitive exception data and prefix tracebacks for logging. It uses recursive attribute modification, allow lists for message allowance, and custom exception classes for clarity. No external communication, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The exception scrubbing is for privacy, not malicious purposes. The logic is consistent, and the security implications are minimal. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are justified based on the utility nature and potential misconfiguration risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, security-conscious utility for exception handling and logging. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scoring is appropriate and justified.",
