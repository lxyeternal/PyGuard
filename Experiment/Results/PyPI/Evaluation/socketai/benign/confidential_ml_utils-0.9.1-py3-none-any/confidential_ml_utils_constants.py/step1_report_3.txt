  "purpose": "Defines constant values for data categories used in confidential machine learning.",
  "sources": "No input or external data is read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no input or output operations are performed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and only defines an enumeration; no suspicious or unusual code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of an Enum class with two categories, PRIVATE and PUBLIC, accompanied by descriptive comments. It contains no input/output operations, no use of environment variables, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard, benign component used for categorizing data types.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless, standard enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
