  "purpose": "Defines data category constants for confidential machine learning.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; purely declarative code.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static enum values used as constants.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward enum with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Python module defining an Enum 'DataCategory' with two values: PRIVATE and PUBLIC. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data handling, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with full confidence. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or insecure operations. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard constants definition for data categories in confidential ML applications. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk present. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
