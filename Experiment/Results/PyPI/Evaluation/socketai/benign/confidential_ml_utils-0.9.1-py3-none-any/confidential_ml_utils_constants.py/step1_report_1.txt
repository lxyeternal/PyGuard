{
  "purpose": "Define constant values for data categories used in confidential machine learning.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class, defines a DataCategory enumeration with two values, PRIVATE and PUBLIC, accompanied by descriptive comments. The code appears to be a straightforward definition of constants related to data privacy levels. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code is well-structured and adheres to standard practices for defining enumerations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module defining data category constants for use in larger projects. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
