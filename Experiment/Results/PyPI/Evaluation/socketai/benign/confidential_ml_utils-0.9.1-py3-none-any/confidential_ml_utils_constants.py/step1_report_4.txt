{
  "purpose": "Define constant values and an enumeration for data categories used in confidential machine learning.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only static class and enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a standard enum class with descriptive docstrings and comments. It defines two categories: PRIVATE and PUBLIC, with clear documentation. No external input, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a constants module for categorizing data in a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple constants definition for data categories in a confidential ML context. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
