{
  "purpose": "Defines constant values and an enumeration for data categories in confidential machine learning.",
  "sources": "Import of the Enum class from the enum module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants and an enum.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class, defines a class with two categories for data classification, and includes docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks. The code appears purely declarative, intended for use as part of a larger system for categorizing data in machine learning contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign definition of constants and an enum for data classification with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
