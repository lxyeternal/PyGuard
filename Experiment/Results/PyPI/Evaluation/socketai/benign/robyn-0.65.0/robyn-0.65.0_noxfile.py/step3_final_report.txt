{
  "purpose": "Automates dependency installation, building, testing, and linting for a Python project using nox.",
  "sources": "Standard Python modules (sys), nox session commands, external tools invoked via session.run (pip, poetry, maturin, rustup, pytest, black, ruff).",
  "sinks": "Execution of external commands that install dependencies, build extensions, and run tests; no untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "Commands are run sequentially; no dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CI/CD automation script for Python projects, executing standard tools and commands. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. External commands are typical and do not process untrusted input. The platform-specific commands for macOS are standard for building Rust extensions. The security risk scores across reports (0.1-0.2) are justified, reflecting minimal inherent risks in such automation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a transparent, standard automation script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
