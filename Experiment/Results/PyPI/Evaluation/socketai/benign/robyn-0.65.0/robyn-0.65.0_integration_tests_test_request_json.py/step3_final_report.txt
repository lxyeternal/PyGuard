  "purpose": "A pytest-based test suite that sends HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads to specific routes, then verifies the response matches expected results.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in test cases, the 'post' helper function performing network requests.",
  "sinks": "The 'post' function executing network requests, response text being checked against expected output.",
  "flows": "Test parameters flow into 'post', which performs network requests; responses are then compared to expected results.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for HTTP endpoints, sending various JSON payloads, including malformed ones, to test input validation and response handling. The 'post' helper function's implementation isn't provided but is presumed to perform safe network requests. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The test cases are standard, and the response checks are typical. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) due to network activity in testing. The confidence in these conclusions is high (1), given the code's clarity and standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.",
