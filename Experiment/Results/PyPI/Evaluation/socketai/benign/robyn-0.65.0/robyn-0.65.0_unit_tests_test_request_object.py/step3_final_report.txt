{
  "purpose": "Constructs and verifies an HTTP request object with static, hardcoded data, likely for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URL components, headers, method, and body within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources; no data flow to external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment to request object properties; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static object creation with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a URL, headers, and a request object with fixed values, then performs assertions to verify properties. No external input, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present. The code appears to be a simple unit test or example usage, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign, static code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static unit test for request object construction. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
