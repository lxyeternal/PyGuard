  "purpose": "Constructs and tests an HTTP request object with specified URL, headers, and method",
  "sources": "Request object creation, URL, Headers, QueryParams, and other attribute initializations",
  "sinks": "Access to request.headers.get() for retrieving header values",
  "flows": "Request object initialized with specific attributes -> Accessed headers via get method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or dynamic code execution observed; standard request object creation",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes related to HTTP request modeling and creates an instance of Request with predefined URL and headers. It performs assertions to verify correct attribute assignments and outputs a header value. All operations are straightforward, with no input/output from untrusted sources or suspicious behavior. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test case for creating and verifying a request object. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified.",
