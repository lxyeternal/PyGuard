  "purpose": "The code contains pytest functions testing dependency injection endpoints via HTTP GET requests, verifying response status and content.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to endpoints: /sync/global_di, /sync/router_di, /di_subrouter/subrouter_global_di, /di_subrouter/subrouter_router_di.",
  "sinks": "Response status code and response text; potential data leaks or misconfigurations if responses are empty or unexpected.",
  "flows": "Test functions send GET requests (source) to endpoints, then assert response status and text (sink).",
  "anomalies": "All responses are empty strings despite expected content; no errors or malicious code detected; server responses are not as expected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and syntactically correct. The repeated 'Empty response' indicates server-side issues such as misconfiguration, deployment problems, or network failures, rather than malicious activity. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malware are present. The lack of response content is operational, not security-related. Malware score is zero; obfuscation is absent. The risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting server or deployment issues rather than security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is secure and correct; the main concern is operational — server endpoints are not returning expected data. No evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The high-level security risk is minimal; focus should be on server configuration and deployment health.",
