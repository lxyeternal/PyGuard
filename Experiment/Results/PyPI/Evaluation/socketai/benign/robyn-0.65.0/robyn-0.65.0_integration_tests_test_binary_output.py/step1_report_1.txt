{
  "purpose": "This code is for testing HTTP endpoints to verify correct content type and response text.",
  "sources": "The 'get' function imported from 'integration_tests.helpers.http_methods_helpers' which performs HTTP GET requests.",
  "sinks": "The assertions on response headers and text which could potentially reveal sensitive data if the server response is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "The 'get' function fetches data from specific routes; the response data is then checked for content type and text content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to perform standard testing of server responses without unusual or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and helper functions, defines test parameters, and verifies that the server responds with specific content types and text. There are no signs of data leakage, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The test only interacts with local URLs and standard HTTP response checks, which are typical in testing environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for verifying server responses. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is typical for integration testing without any suspicious or harmful logic.",
