{
  "purpose": "The code is a pytest-based test suite that verifies server responses for specific API endpoints, checking content type and response text.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to local routes, using a helper 'get' function to retrieve responses.",
  "sinks": "Response headers and body content, specifically Content-Type and response text, which are validated but do not lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code makes GET requests (source) and asserts response headers and content (sink), with no untrusted data processing or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple, local API response validation using standard testing practices. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network activities beyond the intended GET requests. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
