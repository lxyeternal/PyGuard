{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based integration tests for verifying the HTTP response content of specific routes on a local server.",
  "sources": "The code reads route parameters from the test input and performs HTTP GET requests via the imported 'get' function.",
  "sinks": "The code inspects response headers and text, but does not process untrusted data beyond assertions. No data is written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input route parameters flow into the 'get' function, which fetches responses. The response headers and text are then checked for expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. The code uses local testing URLs only.",
  "analysis": "The script defines test cases for specific routes, verifying Content-Type and response text. It uses a local URL and standard testing patterns. No suspicious code, external data leaks, or malicious behavior is detected. The code appears straightforward, intended for testing server responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple test suite for local server endpoints, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and focused on testing output correctness.",
