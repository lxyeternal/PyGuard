{
  "purpose": "This code is a test script using pytest to verify the behavior of specific HTTP endpoints returning binary data.",
  "sources": "The code reads route parameters and makes HTTP GET requests via the imported 'get' function from 'integration_tests.helpers.http_methods_helpers'.",
  "sinks": "The code checks the response headers and text content, which are outputs derived from the HTTP response.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (route) are used to perform GET requests; the response headers and text are examined for expected content.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pytest and a helper function for HTTP GET requests, then defines test parameters and a test function that performs GET requests on specified routes. It verifies the Content-Type header and response text. No untrusted data sources, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is standard test code aimed at validating API responses. There are no signs of malware, malicious data handling, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple pytest test suite to verify server responses for specific endpoints. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
