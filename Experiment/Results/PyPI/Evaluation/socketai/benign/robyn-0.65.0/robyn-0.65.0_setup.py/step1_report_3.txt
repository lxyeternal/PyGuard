  "purpose": "To prevent installation via deprecated methods and enforce the use of pip for installation",
  "sources": "The sys.stderr.write statement that outputs a warning message",
  "sinks": "Standard error stream (sys.stderr), which outputs the message",
  "flows": "Input: installation attempt triggers execution; Output: warning message to stderr, followed by process termination",
  "anomalies": "The code explicitly exits the process after printing a warning, which is typical for blocking unsupported actions. No hidden or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the installation method and blocks the deprecated 'python setup.py install' method by printing a warning and terminating the process. The warning message informs users about preferred installation methods. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no data leaks, or backdoors. The script simply enforces installation guidelines.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign enforcement script to discourage unsupported installation methods. No malicious intent or security risk detected.",
