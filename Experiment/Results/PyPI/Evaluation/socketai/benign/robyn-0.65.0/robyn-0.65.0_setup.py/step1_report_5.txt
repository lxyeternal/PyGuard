  "purpose": "To prevent installation via deprecated method and enforce the use of pip for installation.",
  "sources": "sys.stderr.write() and sys.exit()",
  "sinks": "Writing to stderr and terminating the process",
  "flows": "Code execution begins with writing a message to stderr, then exits the process",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard way to block deprecated installation methods",
  "analysis": "The code checks the installation method and blocks deprecated installation using 'python setup.py install'. It outputs a message to stderr informing users of the preferred installation method and then exits the program. This pattern is a common practice to enforce modern installation procedures. No data from untrusted sources is read; no malicious or suspicious behavior is present. No code injection or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, enforcing best practices for package installation without any malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
