{
  "purpose": "Display an error message and terminate the installation process when an unsupported installation method is used.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only outputs a fixed message.",
  "sinks": "Outputs an error message to standard error and exits the program.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply writes a static message and terminates.",
  "anomalies": "The code's purpose is to prevent certain installation methods; it uses a clear error message and terminates, which is typical for such enforcement. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sys module and writes a message to standard error indicating that 'python setup.py install' is unsupported, advising users to use 'pip install .' instead. Immediately after, it exits the program with status 1. This behavior is a straightforward enforcement of installation method policies, common in packages to avoid deprecated or insecure install methods. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or malicious side effects. The code is simple, clear, and intended to prevent certain install procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply enforces installation policies by blocking specific methods and providing an instructive message. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks. The code is benign and serves a security and compliance purpose.",
