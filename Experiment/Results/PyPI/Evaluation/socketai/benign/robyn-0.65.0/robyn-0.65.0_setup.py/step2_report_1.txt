  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a simple script that writes a warning message to stderr and exits with status 1 if an unsupported installation method is attempted.\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, standard practice, and non-malicious.\n- No external inputs, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The purpose is to enforce installation policies, which is common in setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code performs as described: it outputs a message and exits, which is consistent with the reports.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and not malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign behavior.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All assessments are based on the code's explicit behavior.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  Consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a standard enforcement script used in many open-source projects to prevent unsupported installation methods.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The messages are clear, and the behavior is predictable and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (since it enforces a policy but does not introduce risk itself, a very low score)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard enforcement snippet with no malicious intent. The scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score.",
