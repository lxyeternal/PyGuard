  "purpose": "Enforce installation policy by warning against unsupported 'python setup.py install' method and exiting.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static message written to sys.stderr.",
  "sinks": "sys.stderr.write outputs message; sys.exit(1) terminates process.",
  "flows": "Code writes warning to stderr, then exits, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static message, no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, outputs a multi-line warning message to stderr, then exits with status 1. It performs a standard enforcement role in setup scripts, with no external input, malicious actions, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and security risk of 0. The code's behavior is predictable and safe, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enforcement snippet preventing deprecated installation methods. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
