{
  "purpose": "The code displays an error message and exits if an unsupported installation method is used, guiding users to install via pip.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only writes a message to standard error.",
  "sinks": "Writes a message to sys.stderr and then terminates the program with sys.exit(1).",
  "flows": "Input: None. Output: Message to stderr leading to program termination.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a multi-line string message explicitly discouraging a specific installation method, which is common in setup scripts. No hidden or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and immediately writes a multi-line warning message to standard error, indicating that 'python setup.py install' is unsupported, and instructs to use pip for installation. Following this, it terminates execution with sys.exit(1). There is no input reading, no data exfiltration, nor any code execution beyond the warning and exit. The behavior aligns with common practices in package setup scripts to enforce installation procedures. No signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard safety measure in setup scripts to prevent unsupported installation methods. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code's purpose is solely to inform and prevent an unsupported install process.",
