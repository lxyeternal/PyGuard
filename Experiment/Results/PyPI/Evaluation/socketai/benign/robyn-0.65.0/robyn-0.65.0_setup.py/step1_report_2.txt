  "purpose": "To prevent installation of the package using deprecated methods and enforce modern pip installation practices.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the sys.stderr stream and hardcodes a message string to display during execution.",
  "sinks": "The code writes an error message to stderr and terminates the process with sys.exit(1).",
  "flows": "The message string flows from hardcoded text to stderr, then the program exits, terminating further execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script checks the installation method and outputs an error message if an unsupported method is used, then terminates. There are no external data sources, and the flow is simple and static. The purpose appears to be to enforce correct installation procedures without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign installation check that prevents deprecated installation methods and guides users towards correct practices. No malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks are present.",
