{
  "purpose": "The code contains pytest functions testing multipart HTTP POST endpoints with static data, asserting response content. It is intended for integration testing of API endpoints.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the test functions and the external helper 'multipart_post'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input; response assertions are read-only checks.",
  "flows": "Static data sent via 'multipart_post' to server endpoints; responses checked for specific substrings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The helper function's implementation is not provided but assumed standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code performing HTTP multipart requests with static data, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The response assertions are simple substring checks. The external helper 'multipart_post' is presumed safe. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard testing code with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, reflecting the safe and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
