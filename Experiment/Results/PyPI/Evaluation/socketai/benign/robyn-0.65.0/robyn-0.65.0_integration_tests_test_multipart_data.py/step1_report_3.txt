{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to run integration tests for HTTP POST requests with multipart form data, verifying server responses contain expected content.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided through the 'files' parameter in the multipart_post function call, which is used as test data for HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the multipart_post function, which sends data over the network to specified endpoints; the response text is checked for specific substrings.",
  "flows": "Input data (files parameter) flows into the multipart_post function, which then sends the data over the network. Response data is examined for expected content.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses test functions with no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed; dependency on external helper function 'multipart_post' requires trust but appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes pytest framework for structured testing, with parameterized tests for different function types. The 'multipart_post' helper is imported from a presumably safe module. Tests check for expected substrings in responses. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is testing server responses with multipart data, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious payloads. The overall structure is typical for test scripts, and no anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign set of integration tests for HTTP endpoints, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
