{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions for HTTP POST requests using multipart form data, likely to verify server handling of multipart uploads.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'multipart_post' helper function with 'files' parameter, and the 'function_type' parameter from test parametrization.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'res' object, specifically 'res.text', which is checked for specific substrings to verify server responses.",
  "flows": "Input data from test parameters and helper functions flows through the 'multipart_post' function to the server, then the response is checked for expected content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected. Usage appears standard for test code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test cases that perform multipart POST requests with static file data. It uses standard pytest features like parameterization and markers. No suspicious data handling, malicious network activity, or security issues are evident. The code appears to be straightforward test code aimed at verifying server behavior in handling multipart form data. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical test suite for API endpoints involving multipart data, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears safe and well-structured for testing purposes.",
