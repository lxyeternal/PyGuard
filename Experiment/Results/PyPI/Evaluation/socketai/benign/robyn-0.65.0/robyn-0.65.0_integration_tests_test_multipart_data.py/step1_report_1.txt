{
  "purpose": "The code contains pytest test functions for HTTP multipart form data and file upload endpoints, used in integration testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'files' argument in the multipart_post function call, and the 'session' fixture (likely from external code).",
  "sinks": "The code inspects the response text for specific substrings ('multipart', 'hello'), but does not process untrusted data beyond assertions.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'files' is sent via multipart_post to server endpoints, then response text is checked for certain substrings. No untrusted data flows into system-critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The test functions are straightforward, with no suspicious logic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pytest functions that perform HTTP POST requests with multipart data to specific endpoints, then verify response content. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscated logic. The code uses standard testing patterns and external helper functions, with no evident security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate test code for API endpoints with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
