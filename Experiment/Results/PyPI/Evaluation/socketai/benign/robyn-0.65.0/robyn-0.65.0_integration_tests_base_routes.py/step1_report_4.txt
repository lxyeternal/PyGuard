{
  "purpose": "This code implements a web server with WebSocket, REST API endpoints, middleware, error handling, and dependency injection, primarily for testing and demonstrating the Robyn framework capabilities.",
  "sources": "Request headers, request body, request query parameters, request path parameters, environment variables, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Response objects, WebSocket message handlers, log outputs, file serving functions, and potential network communications.",
  "flows": "Input data from request sources flows through request handlers, middleware, and into response or WebSocket responses, with some data used in server logic and responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code contains placeholder functions and test routes. Use of global variables (websocket_state) is typical for test setups but could be misused in production. No obfuscated code or malicious code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the Robyn web framework, covering WebSocket and HTTP methods, middleware, error handling, authentication, file serving, and dependency injection. It uses standard security practices like token-based auth and safe response handling. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. All data flows are within a controlled test environment, and no unsafe or insecure coding practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a testing or demonstration implementation of a web server with multiple features. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. It does not include any backdoors, secret leaks, or harmful operations. The overall security risk is very low.",
