{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a web server with various routes, WebSocket handlers, middleware, and dependency injections, primarily for testing, demonstration, or development purposes.",
  "sources": "Request headers, query parameters, path parameters, body payloads, environment variables, and tokens for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Response headers, WebSocket message sends, broadcast functions, file serving, and potential token handling.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as request data, headers, or tokens flow into response generation, WebSocket message handling, or data processing, with some routes involving token validation or environment-dependent behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code includes standard middleware, route definitions, and test handlers. The WebSocket handlers perform message exchanges without evident malicious behavior. Token handling is simplistic but not malicious. The code includes exception handling, which appears standard. No suspicious external domain connections or hidden backdoors are detected. Usage of environment variables is not present; dependencies are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test server setup for various HTTP methods, middleware, WebSocket interactions, and dependency injections. It includes route definitions for normal responses, error handling, authentication, and file serving. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious data processing. The WebSocket functions perform message exchanges without harmful commands. The token handling is rudimentary, intended for testing authentication mechanisms. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious dynamic code evaluations. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, benign web server configuration with testing and demonstration functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a non-malicious web server implementation used for testing, development, and demonstration purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities that indicate sabotage or malware. It is safe to use within its intended testing scope.",
