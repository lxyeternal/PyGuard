{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based tests to verify the availability and responses of local web servers, with some environment variable checks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('ROBYN_HOST', 'ROBYN_PORT'), network functions (get_network_host), and HTTP request responses.",
  "sinks": "Requests to local URLs, environment variable assertions, and the use of network host data.",
  "flows": "Network host info from get_network_host() flows into URL formation; environment variables are checked after network requests; environment variables are read directly from environment during tests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated or suspicious code behavior. No unusual or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple HTTP GET requests to local and network-hosted URLs and asserts expected status codes. It reads environment variables to verify host and port configurations. All data sources are either static, environment variables, or function outputs used for forming URLs. No data is sent over the network beyond simple requests; no data leakage or malicious data handling is evident. The code uses standard Python modules and third-party libraries such as pytest and requests without any suspicious activity. The only potentially sensitive info is environment variables, but their usage here appears intended for configuration verification, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test code used for verifying local and network service availability. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses environment variables for configuration and performs network requests securely in a controlled testing context.",
