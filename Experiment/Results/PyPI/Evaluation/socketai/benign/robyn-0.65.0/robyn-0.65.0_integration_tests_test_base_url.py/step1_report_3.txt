{
  "purpose": "The code performs network tests on local and environment-dependent URLs, primarily for benchmarking purposes.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as 'ROBYN_HOST' and 'ROBYN_PORT', and data from network helper functions and HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on environment variables and HTTP response status codes; no data leakage or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are checked against expected values; network responses are validated for status codes, with no data flows leading to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; use of environment variables is standard and safe in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common libraries and uses pytest for testing network endpoints. It verifies server responses and compares environment variables to expected values. No external data is processed in a malicious manner. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code appears to be standard testing code for network services.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test suite for local network endpoints, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as expected for testing purposes without introducing vulnerabilities.",
