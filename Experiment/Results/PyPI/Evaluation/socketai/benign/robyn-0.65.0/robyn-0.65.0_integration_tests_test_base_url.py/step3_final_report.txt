{
  "purpose": "The code performs integration tests on web service endpoints, verifying server responses and environment variable configurations.",
  "sources": "Requests to localhost or networked URLs, environment variables ('ROBYN_HOST', 'ROBYN_PORT'), and external helper function get_network_host().",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests and environment variable checks; no untrusted data processing or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables and get_network_host() -> sink: requests.get() and environment variable assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. Usage of environment variables and network info is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard modules for network requests and environment variable validation. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. External function get_network_host() is assumed benign. The tests serve to verify server responses and configurations. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing code with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero. The risk score should be low, around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The provided reports' assessments are consistent and accurate.",
