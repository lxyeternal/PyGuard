  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is simple pytest tests verifying server responses and environment variables, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malware signals. The environment variables are used for configuration verification, not malicious purposes.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard testing practices with no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. This aligns with the code's benign purpose.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Network testing with environment variables and response validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no data leakage. The code is standard testing code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The risk score is minimal and justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar network and environment variable checks, standard testing.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no data exfiltration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Slightly higher risk score, but still reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard web service tests with environment variables and external helper functions.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Justified as the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's purpose—simple network tests and environment variable checks—there's no inherent security risk. The slight variations in risk scores (0.1 or 0.2) are reasonable, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.0 for all, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0, as code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain low, around 0.1 to 0.2, consistent with the reports.\n\n**Note:** The only scenario where a higher risk score might be justified is if the environment variables or helper functions are sourced from untrusted sources or if the code is part of a larger, unreviewed codebase with potential malicious intent. Based solely on the provided code snippets and reports, this does not appear to be the case.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThe code is legitimate, straightforward testing code with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
