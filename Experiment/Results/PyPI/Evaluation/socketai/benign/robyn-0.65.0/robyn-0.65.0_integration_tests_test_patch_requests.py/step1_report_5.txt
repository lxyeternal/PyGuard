  "purpose": "Unit tests for HTTP PATCH methods in an integration testing framework, verifying response content and headers.",
  "sources": "Imports from pytest and helper functions from integration_tests.helpers.http_methods_helpers, specifically the 'patch' function.",
  "sinks": "Res variables where HTTP responses are stored; assertions on response text and headers.",
  "flows": "Calling 'patch' functions as test inputs, then checking response attributes via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The test functions appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and helper functions to perform parametric tests on HTTP PATCH methods. It verifies the response content and headers, which is typical for test cases. No user input is processed directly; responses are evaluated against expected values. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The code structure and syntax are standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. It appears to be straightforward test code designed to validate API behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of unit tests for HTTP PATCH endpoints. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected. The code simply verifies expected responses in an integration testing context.",
