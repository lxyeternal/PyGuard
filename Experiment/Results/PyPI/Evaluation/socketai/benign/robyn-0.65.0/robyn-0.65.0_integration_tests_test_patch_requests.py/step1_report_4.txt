{
  "purpose": "The code defines pytest-based benchmark tests for HTTP PATCH methods using helper functions, testing different function types and parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the test function parameters (function_type, data), and the imported 'patch' helper function.",
  "sinks": "Potential data transmission in the 'patch' helper, response assertions, and headers access.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to 'patch', which likely performs HTTP requests; response data is checked for expected text and headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward testing code without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing libraries and helper functions, then defines parameterized benchmark tests for sync and async patch functions. It performs HTTP PATCH requests and asserts response content and headers. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity. The code structure and usage are typical for testing frameworks. No hidden behaviors or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard testing code with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears safe and intentionally designed for performance benchmarking of HTTP patch operations.",
