  "purpose": "The code is a pytest test suite verifying HTTP PATCH helper functions for sync and async modes, asserting response content and headers.",
  "sources": "The 'patch' helper function performing HTTP PATCH requests, and static parameters used in tests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made via the 'patch' helper, which could be sinks if untrusted data were involved, but here are controlled.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke 'patch' with specific URLs and data, then assertions verify responses; data flows from test inputs to network requests and responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API endpoint testing using pytest, with parameterized tests for 'sync' and 'async' functions. The 'patch' helper is assumed to be a typical HTTP request wrapper. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. Response assertions are typical for tests. The scores assigned (malware=0, low security risk) are appropriate given the benign, controlled nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for HTTP PATCH operations, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.1). The code is safe and suitable for use.",
