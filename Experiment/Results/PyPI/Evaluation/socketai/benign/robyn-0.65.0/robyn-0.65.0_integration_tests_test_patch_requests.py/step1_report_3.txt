{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests for HTTP PATCH request functions, verifying the behavior of patch helper functions with different parameters and function types.",
  "sources": "The code reads test parameters ('function_type') and session objects, as well as the imported 'patch' function from an external helper module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or process untrusted input in a way that leads to data leaks or system effects; it mainly asserts responses from HTTP requests.",
  "flows": "The test functions call the 'patch' helper with specific URLs and optional data, then perform assertions on the response object, verifying response content and headers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or malicious patterns are present. The code uses standard testing and HTTP request patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks and helper functions, then defines two parameterized test functions that invoke HTTP patch requests. The tests check for expected response content and headers, typical in unit testing. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are evident. The code relies on external helper modules, but based on this snippet alone, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests for HTTP PATCH helper functions. It does not contain malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and standard for testing HTTP request behaviors.",
