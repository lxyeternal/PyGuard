  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign or mildly suspicious, with high suspicion only in reports showing obfuscation and dynamic execution. Scores are consistent with observed patterns, and no unwarranted claims are made. Overall, the dependency exhibits low to moderate security risk, warranting further review for the more suspicious cases."
