  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, file reads, network endpoints, dynamic code execution (eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into dynamic execution or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec with unverified input, hardcoded secrets, complex or misleading code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of obfuscation and dynamic execution. Reports 1 and 2 show no suspicious activity, with minimal or no obfuscation. Reports 3 and 4 demonstrate significant obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with network activity and signs of potential malicious intent, justifying higher malware and risk scores. Report 5 indicates red flags like eval/exec and secrets but lacks confirmed malicious actions, warranting cautious but low scores. The scoring aligns with observed patterns, with higher suspicion in reports showing obfuscation and dynamic execution. Slight score adjustments for Reports 2 and 5 improve accuracy, reflecting benign nature or minimal risk respectively.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign or mildly suspicious, with high suspicion only in reports showing obfuscation and dynamic execution. Scores are consistent with observed patterns, and no unwarranted claims are made. Overall, the dependency exhibits low to moderate security risk, warranting further review for the more suspicious cases.",
