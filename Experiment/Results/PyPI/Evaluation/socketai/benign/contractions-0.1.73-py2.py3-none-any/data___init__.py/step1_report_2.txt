  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script performing basic data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Data sources include imported modules and possibly environment variables or input functions, if present. No external untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file operations, network connections, or printing/output functions, but none are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) through processing functions to output or storage sinks. No suspicious flow patterns are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly. It contains standard imports and functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or other typical malware indicators. The code performs its intended functions without anomalous or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious activity.",
