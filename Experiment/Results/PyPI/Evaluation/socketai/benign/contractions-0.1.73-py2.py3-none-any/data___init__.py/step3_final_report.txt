  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Code input, dynamic code execution functions (eval(), exec()), hardcoded secrets, input handling, external data reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, code injection points, dynamic code execution pathways, network connections, file modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, untrusted data) -> eval()/exec() or other dynamic execution functions -> potential malicious payloads or misuse.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscation suspicion, absence of code in some reports, inconsistent or missing code snippets.",
  "analysis": "Most reports lack explicit code, leading to low suspicion and appropriate low scores. Report 3 shows dynamic code execution, justifying higher suspicion scores; minor adjustments to malware and risk scores are recommended to better reflect potential danger. Other reports are consistent with benign assessments. Overall, the scores align with the provided descriptions, with slight modifications to Report 3 for increased accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates minimal malicious activity across the reports, with Report 3 presenting moderate suspicion due to dynamic code execution. Adjusting malware score to 0.3 and security risk to 0.7 for Report 3 improves alignment with observed patterns. Other reports are appropriately scored. No further significant concerns are identified.",
