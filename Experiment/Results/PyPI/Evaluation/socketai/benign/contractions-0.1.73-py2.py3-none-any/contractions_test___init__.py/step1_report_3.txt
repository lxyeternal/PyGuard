{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the contractions Python library to verify its functions like fixing contractions, adding new contractions, and previewing text.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings in test functions, primarily string literals and the results of contractions.fix() and contractions.preview().",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted external data; all data sources are fixed strings within test functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from string inputs into contractions.fix() and contractions.preview() functions, with assertions checking outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions verifying the behavior of the contractions library. It uses fixed string inputs, calls library functions, and asserts expected outputs. No external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues. The code structure is typical for unit testing and does not invoke any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of unit tests for a Python library, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
