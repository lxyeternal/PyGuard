{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions for the 'contractions' Python library, validating its contraction fixing and preview functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings from test cases, such as strings passed to 'contractions.fix()' and 'contractions.preview()'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data flows into potentially harmful operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input strings into the 'contractions' functions, with results checked via assertions, but no external or untrusted data is used beyond test inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward test code for a library.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively performs unit tests on the 'contractions' library, validating correct contraction expansion and preview features. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no network access, no data leakage, or unsafe operations. The code operates on fixed input data for testing purposes. It does not include any code execution from untrusted sources, nor does it modify or interact with external systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test code for a Python library, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks.",
