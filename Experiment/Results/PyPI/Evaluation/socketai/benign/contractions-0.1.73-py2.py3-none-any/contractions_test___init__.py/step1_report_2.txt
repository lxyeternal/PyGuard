  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'contractions' library to verify contraction fixing and preview functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings in various test functions and uses the contractions.fix() and contractions.preview() methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to external systems, files, or network. It only processes and asserts string data.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to contractions.fix() and contractions.preview(); results are checked with assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests that validate the functionality of the 'contractions' library. It uses straightforward assertions to verify expected behavior. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious activities are present. The code does not interact with external systems, does not contain hidden behaviors, or suspicious imports beyond the standard testing pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign set of unit tests for a language processing library. No security threats or malicious intent are evident. The code appears safe and standard for testing purposes.",
