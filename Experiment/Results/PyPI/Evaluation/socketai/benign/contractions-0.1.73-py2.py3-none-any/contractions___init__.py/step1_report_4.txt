{
  "purpose": "This code processes contractions, slang, and leftovers dictionaries, generates combinations of tokens, and performs text search and replacement operations on input text, primarily for text normalization and analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data for contraction and slang dictionaries via pkgutil.get_data; processes text input in functions such as fix() and preview(); accesses dictionary keys and external data for text processing.",
  "sinks": "Uses TextSearch objects to perform replacements and searches on text; no direct untrusted data sinks such as network calls or file writes are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON package data into dictionaries, which are then used to initialize TextSearch objects; user-provided text flows into functions like fix() and preview() where replacements and searches are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code generates multiple combinations of contractions but does so in a benign manner related to text processing. No obfuscated code or misleading variable use is present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads contraction, leftovers, and slang dictionaries from package resources. It augments the contractions with month abbreviations and other variants, then creates a comprehensive 'unsafe_dict' for contractions involving apostrophes, excluding safety keys. Multiple TextSearch objects are instantiated for various processing modes. The functions provide text replacement, addition, and preview capabilities. No code indicates malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The processing is standard for text normalization and searching, with no hidden or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign text processing module designed for contraction and slang normalization. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only notable activity is extensive dictionary manipulation and text search operations, which are typical for such applications.",
