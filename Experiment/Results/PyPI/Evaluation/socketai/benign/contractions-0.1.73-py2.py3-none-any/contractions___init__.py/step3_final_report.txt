{
  "purpose": "The code loads JSON dictionaries for contractions, leftovers, and slang from package resources, processes them to generate variants with and without apostrophes, and creates multiple TextSearch objects for different normalization modes. It provides functions for fixing, adding, and previewing text with these dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Reads embedded JSON data via pkgutil.get_data; processes dictionaries and generates contraction variants; uses TextSearch to perform in-memory search and replace operations.",
  "sinks": "In-memory text processing; no external network, file, or system modifications; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON data -> processes dictionaries -> generates contraction variants -> initializes TextSearch objects -> performs in-memory replacements and previews.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive generation of contraction variants with and without apostrophes, which is standard in NLP but could be resource-intensive; no suspicious code or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads JSON data for contractions, leftovers, and slang from package resources, then creates multiple TextSearch instances with different configurations for text normalization. It generates all possible variants of contractions with and without apostrophes, which is a common NLP technique. The functions provided operate solely in memory, performing replacements, additions, and previews without external communication. No malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The dynamic contraction variant generation is benign and intended for comprehensive normalization. The code's behavior is straightforward, and no obfuscation or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign text normalization utility for handling contractions and slang, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk approximately 0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
