      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign or mildly suspicious, with high suspicion only in reports showing obfuscation and dynamic execution. Scores are consistent with observed patterns, and no unwarranted claims are made. Overall, the dependency exhibits low to moderate security risk, warranting further review for the more suspicious cases."

      "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates minimal malicious activity across the reports, with Report 3 presenting moderate suspicion due to dynamic code execution. Adjusting malware score to 0.3 and security risk to 0.7 for Report 3 improves alignment with observed patterns. Other reports are appropriately scored. No further significant concerns are identified."
