  "purpose": "Set up a PostgreSQL database table, insert static song data, and paginate through the results using sqlakeyset.",
  "sources": "Static data in the SINGLES string, database connection string, and query execution points.",
  "sinks": "Database table creation, data insertion, and query execution; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Static data is parsed and inserted into the database; query retrieves ordered data with pagination.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'drop table if exists' which could be destructive in production but is typical in test scripts; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard database setup, data insertion, and paginated retrieval using well-known libraries. No user input, external data, or network activity suggests malicious intent. The only notable point is the destructive 'drop table' command, which is common in demo scripts but could be risky in production. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The static data and straightforward ORM usage indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward database management script with no indicators of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score appropriately reflects the destructive table operations in a controlled environment, but overall, the code is safe.",
