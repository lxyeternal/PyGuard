{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for managing SQLAlchemy database connections, sessions, and version-specific imports.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (sqlalchemy, packaging), reads sqlalchemy.__version__, imports local modules based on version.",
  "sinks": "Returns database engine or connection objects, creates Session objects, raises ValueError on invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (engine, connection, session) flow through get_bind and get_session functions, returning bound objects or raising errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. Version-based conditional imports are normal. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages database connection objects and dynamically imports version-specific modules based on sqlalchemy version. No data is read from untrusted sources or external inputs, nor are there any suspicious data flows. The functions perform type checks and object returns, raising errors for invalid types. No potential code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The conditional import logic based on version is standard for compatibility. No anomalies or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for handling SQLAlchemy database sessions and connections, with version-aware imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
