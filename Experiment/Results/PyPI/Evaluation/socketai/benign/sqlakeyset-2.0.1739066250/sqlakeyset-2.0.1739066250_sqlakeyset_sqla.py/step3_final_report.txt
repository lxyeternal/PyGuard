  "purpose": "Utility module for managing SQLAlchemy sessions and engines with version compatibility handling.",
  "sources": "Reads SQLAlchemy version, imports modules, and defines fallback classes for async support.",
  "sinks": "Returns or creates SQLAlchemy Engine, Connection, or Session objects; no external data handling.",
  "flows": "Functions pass or return database connection/session objects based on input types; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs; fallback classes are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility for SQLAlchemy, handling different versions and async support. It uses standard patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The fallback classes for async components are typical for backward compatibility. The functions safely manage database objects without external data leaks or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for database connection management. No malicious intent or security issues are evident. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by its utility nature.",
