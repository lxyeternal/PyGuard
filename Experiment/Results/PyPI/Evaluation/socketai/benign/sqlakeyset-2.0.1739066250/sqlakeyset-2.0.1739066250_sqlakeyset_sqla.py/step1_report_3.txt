  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for handling SQLAlchemy engine, connection, and session objects, including compatibility across different SQLAlchemy versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sqlalchemy, version), environment detection (importing async modules), version parsing, and functions get_bind and get_session.",
  "sinks": "Potentially any usage of get_bind and get_session could lead to database interactions. However, these are standard ORM operations with no suspicious data flow. No untrusted input handling is visible.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., query objects, engine, or session) flows into get_bind or get_session, which then produce database connection objects used in subsequent database operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code handles version compatibility, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the sqlalchemy version to import appropriate modules, defines functions to retrieve database connections or sessions safely, and includes compatibility for async features. The code appears to be a standard utility module for database access. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as malicious code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All imported modules and functions are typical for database handling. The dynamic import based on version is a normal pattern for maintaining compatibility. No external data or untrusted sources are processed in a malicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module designed for database connection management with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
