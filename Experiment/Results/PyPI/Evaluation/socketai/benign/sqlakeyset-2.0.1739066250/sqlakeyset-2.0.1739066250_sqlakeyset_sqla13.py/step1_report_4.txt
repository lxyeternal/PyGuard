  "purpose": "Provides internal utility methods for manipulating SQLAlchemy query results and selectables, mainly for type coercion and query normalization.",
  "sources": "Reads from query objects, query entities, and SQLAlchemy internal attributes such as _entities, _label_name, _order_by_clause, _group_by_clause, and internal result proxy processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses internal SQLAlchemy methods and attributes that process rows, execute queries, and access metadata, which could be misused for data extraction or injection if combined with malicious input. No direct sinks for network or filesystem operations are present.",
  "flows": "Query objects and their internal attributes flow into functions that produce or manipulate result rows, including trimming extra columns, coercing rows, and extracting query clauses.",
  "anomalies": "Utilizes internal SQLAlchemy attributes (e.g., _entities, _metadata, _processors) which are not part of the public API, potentially indicating advanced internal manipulation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscation observed. No code injection or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects and manipulates SQLAlchemy query result structures, converting rows and extracting query clauses, primarily for internal type handling and query normalization. It relies on SQLAlchemy's internal attributes and functions. No suspicious code behavior, external data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident. The code appears to serve as an internal utility library for type coercion and query inspection, with no malicious intent or malicious code behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of internal utilities for SQLAlchemy query result processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It mainly accesses and manipulates internal SQLAlchemy attributes for type handling. No security risks or malicious intent are apparent based on the code reviewed.",
