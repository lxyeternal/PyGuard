  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as internal utilities for SQLAlchemy result processing. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The reliance on internal attributes is a maintenance concern but not a security issue. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score of approximately 0.2 is justified due to internal API reliance. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for internal use."
