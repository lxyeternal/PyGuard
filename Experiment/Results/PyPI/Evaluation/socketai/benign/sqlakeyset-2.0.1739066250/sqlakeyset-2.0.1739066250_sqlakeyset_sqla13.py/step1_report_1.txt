{
  "purpose": "This code provides internal utility methods for manipulating SQLAlchemy query results, including type handling, row coercion, and query introspection.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from SQLAlchemy query objects, including query attributes (_entities, is_single_entity), execution results (result_proxy), and selectables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the result_type functions which manipulate rows, and the execute method on SQLAlchemy sessions, which could be a point of injection if inputs are untrusted, but not inherently malicious here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from SQLAlchemy query objects and execution results into custom result types and row processing functions, with no external or untrusted data injected into the system directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated sections are present. The code performs standard internal manipulations of SQLAlchemy internals for type handling and row trimming.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for handling SQLAlchemy query results, including generating row types, coercing rows to specific formats, and extracting query clauses. It uses internal attributes (_entities, _label_name, _metadata, etc.), which are standard for SQLAlchemy's internal API but not exposed publicly. The functions do not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or execute arbitrary code; they simply manipulate query results and metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as secret backdoors, data leaks, or code injection. The use of internal attributes could pose maintenance or compatibility concerns but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate internal utility for SQLAlchemy result handling, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It simply manipulates query results and metadata, relying on internal attributes. There is a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
