  "purpose": "Internal utility functions for SQLAlchemy <=1.3 result handling, manipulating query results, coercing rows, and extracting query clauses.",
  "sources": "Reads internal attributes of SQLAlchemy query and result objects such as _entities, _label_name, _metadata, _process_row, _order_by_clause, _group_by_clause.",
  "sinks": "Processes rows internally; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "flows": "Internal functions access query attributes, process rows, and return modified data or query clauses.",
  "anomalies": "Uses internal, undocumented attributes (e.g., _entities, _metadata, _process_row), which are not part of the public API.",
  "analysis": "The code provides internal utilities for handling SQLAlchemy query results, relying on internal attributes. No malicious code, backdoors, or external data leaks are present. The reliance on internal attributes could cause stability issues if internal APIs change but does not indicate malicious intent. The functions do not perform any network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and intended for internal use, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as internal utilities for SQLAlchemy result processing. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The reliance on internal attributes is a maintenance concern but not a security issue. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score of approximately 0.2 is justified due to internal API reliance. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for internal use.",
