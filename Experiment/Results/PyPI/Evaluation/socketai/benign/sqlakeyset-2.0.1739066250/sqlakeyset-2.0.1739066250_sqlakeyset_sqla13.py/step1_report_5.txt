{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for manipulating SQLAlchemy query results and internal representations, likely for customizing result handling or internal query operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from SQLAlchemy query objects, such as query._entities, query.is_single_entity, and the result of executing selectables via s.execute().",
  "sinks": "Data is processed and returned via functions like orm_result_type, orm_coerce_row, core_result_type, core_coerce_row, which handle rows and result types, but no data is sent over the network or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from query objects and SQL execution results into processing functions like orm_result_type, orm_coerce_row, core_result_type, and core_coerce_row, transforming query results into custom or trimmed formats.",
  "anomalies": "The code accesses internal attributes of SQLAlchemy objects (e.g., _entities, _process_row, _metadata, _keymap), which are typically considered internal and may change across versions. There are no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code; however, reliance on internal attributes is unusual and potentially unsafe for long-term compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions to manipulate and process SQLAlchemy query results, including customizing result row types, trimming extra columns, and extracting clauses. It heavily relies on internal attributes of SQLAlchemy objects, which can pose stability and security risks if those internals are changed or exploited. No network activity, credential handling, or suspicious data leakage mechanisms are present. The functions appear to be designed for internal query result handling, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of internal utilities for SQLAlchemy result processing, relying on internal attributes that could be fragile. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The only concern is the dependency on internal attributes that might change, but this does not constitute malicious intent.",
