  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides internal utilities for SQLAlchemy result handling, relying on internal attributes like `_entities`, `_label_name`, `_metadata`, etc. No malicious behavior or external data leakage is evident.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Code presence:** The functions match the description; they manipulate query internals, process rows, extract clauses.\n  - **Malicious activity:** None observed. The code is purely internal utility functions.\n  - **Use of internal attributes:** Yes, but common in advanced internal utilities.\n  - **Security implications:** Low; no injection, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 is reasonable given reliance on internal attributes, but no active security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on internal query utilities, with reliance on internal attributes and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Same points as above; internal attribute access, no network or malicious code.\n  - Potential stability concern due to internal attribute reliance, but not security.\n\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 remains appropriate; internal attribute dependence.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Internal utilities for query normalization, result coercion, and clause extraction, using internal attributes like `_entities`, `_label_name`, `_order_by_clause`.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Same pattern: internal attribute access, no malicious code.\n  - Slightly more emphasis on executing SQL with `selectable.limit(0)` but still internal processing.\n\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Risk:** 0.0 or 0.2 is acceptable; no active security threat.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for manipulating SQLAlchemy results, relying on internal attributes like `_entities`, `_metadata`, `_processors`.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Same pattern: internal attribute access, no malicious activity.\n  - The code is designed for internal result processing, with potential stability issues but not security.\n\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar internal utilities, focusing on query result manipulation, again relying on internal attributes.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Same reasoning: no malicious code, no external data leaks.\n  - The reliance on internal attributes could cause stability issues but not security risks.\n\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n  - **Risk:** 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or harmful behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward, though relying on internal attributes.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly conservative at 0.2, reflecting potential maintenance or compatibility issues due to internal attribute reliance, but not security risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments needed unless new evidence emerges.\n- The code is a legitimate internal utility for SQLAlchemy result handling, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to reliance on internal, undocumented attributes which could change, causing stability issues but not security threats)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed review above.",
