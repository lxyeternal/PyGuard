{
  "purpose": "The code provides internal utility functions and class extensions for manipulating SQLAlchemy ORM and Core result objects, primarily for customizing and extracting query result data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from SQLAlchemy query objects, query descriptions, and row objects; specifically from attributes like `column_descriptions`, `_compile_state()`, `_compile_context()`, `_order_by_clauses`, `_group_by_clauses`, and row internal attributes like `_parent`, `_data`, `_key_to_index`, and `_keymap`.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or transmit data outside the process. It manipulates internal data structures and constructs result types, mainly for internal processing and result handling.",
  "flows": "Input sources include query descriptions and row data; the functions create custom result types, trim rows, and extract clauses, with no network or external data flow. The internal `_compile_state()` and internal row attributes are used to generate result schemas and modify row data.",
  "anomalies": "The code accesses and manipulates internal attributes (prefixed with underscores) of SQLAlchemy ORM and Row objects, which is typically discouraged as these are considered internal APIs. The `_reduce()` method is invoked on `SimpleResultMetaData`, which might be non-standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code comments suggest adaptation from SQLAlchemy internals but do not include malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a set of internal utilities for customizing and manipulating SQLAlchemy ORM and Core result data. It heavily relies on internal attributes and methods, such as `_compile_state()`, `_compile_context()`, `_entities`, `_keymap`, and `_parent`, which are not part of the public API and could change with library updates. The purpose is to modify or extract result data in specific ways, such as trimming extra columns or generating custom result types. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident. The manipulation of internal data structures could be risky if misused but does not indicate malicious intent in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of internal utilities for SQLAlchemy result handling, with a focus on internal attribute manipulation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The reliance on internal APIs presents potential stability risks but not security threats. Overall, the code appears to be designed for advanced result processing without malicious intent.",
