  "purpose": "Internal utilities for manipulating and customizing SQLAlchemy 1.4/2.0 result objects, including extracting keys, creating result types, trimming rows, and handling internal attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads internal attributes such as '_compile_state', '_entities', '_parent', '_keymap', '_reduce', and other non-public APIs within SQLAlchemy result and row objects.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file operations; solely internal data structure manipulations.",
  "flows": "Internal attribute access (sources) to result processing functions like '_create_result_tuple', 'orm_coerce_row', 'core_coerce_row', and result type functions.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive reliance on internal, non-public APIs (attributes prefixed with '_'), including use of non-standard methods like '_reduce()' on 'SimpleResultMetaData'. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates SQLAlchemy internal result and row objects for advanced result handling, such as extracting keys, creating custom result types, trimming extra columns, and handling internal metadata. It relies heavily on internal attributes and methods, which are unstable and subject to change across SQLAlchemy versions. No network, file, or external data operations are present. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is intended for internal use within a larger application or library, not for public consumption. The reliance on internal APIs introduces potential stability risks but does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of internal utility functions for SQLAlchemy result processing, with no malicious intent or malware. It uses internal APIs that could change, posing stability concerns but not security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the internal API reliance.",
