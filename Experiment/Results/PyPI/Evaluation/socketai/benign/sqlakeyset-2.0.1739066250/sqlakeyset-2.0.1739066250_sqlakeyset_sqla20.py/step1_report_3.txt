{
  "purpose": "This code provides internal utility functions and classes to manipulate SQLAlchemy 1.4/2.0 query results, including creating custom result types, trimming extra columns, and extracting query clauses.",
  "sources": "Reads input from SQLAlchemy ORM query objects, including column descriptions, compile states, and result rows.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe data processing in functions like orm_coerce_row and core_coerce_row that manipulate database result rows; no evident direct data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from SQLAlchemy query results through functions like orm_coerce_row and core_coerce_row to produce sanitized or modified rows, with some internal transformations of query metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. The code manipulates query result internals, but nothing appears intended for malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly interacts with SQLAlchemy internals to customize or extract query result data. It does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or external data exfiltration. No obfuscated code patterns, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors are present. The functions adjust the structure of database result rows, which could be exploited if combined with malicious queries, but as-is, the code's purpose appears benign and focused on internal result handling. The functions are standard for customizing ORM behavior and do not seem malicious or harmful in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of internal utilities for SQLAlchemy result handling, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not perform external communications or data exfiltration. The code appears safe, well-structured, and intended for legitimate ORM result manipulation.",
