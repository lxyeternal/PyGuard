  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described purpose, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manipulates SQLAlchemy internals for result processing, relying heavily on internal attributes like `_compile_state()`, `_entities`, `_keymap`, etc. No malicious activity or malware is identified. The code is intended for advanced internal result handling.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Presence of issues:** The code indeed accesses internal attributes, which is risky for stability but not malicious.\n  - **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or malicious flaws detected.\n  - **Scores:** Malware score is 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0.2, reflecting moderate internal API reliance.\n  - **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; code is for internal utilities with potential stability risks.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on internal attribute access for result customization. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Presence of issues:** Correctly identifies internal attribute access.\n  - **Malware:** Score of 0 is appropriate.\n  - **Security risk:** Moderate due to internal API reliance.\n  - **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; internal utility code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Functions for trimming rows, creating result types, and extracting clauses, all using internal attributes. No malicious actions observed.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Presence of issues:** Internal attribute use is noted but not malicious.\n  - **Malware:** Score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n  - **Conclusion:** Safe, internal result processing code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for result handling, no external or malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Presence of issues:** Internal attribute access, but no malicious intent.\n  - **Malware:** Score of 0 is correct.\n  - **Conclusion:** No security concerns, legitimate internal code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on internal attribute manipulation for result processing, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - **Presence of issues:** Access to internal attributes is noted but not malicious.\n  - **Malware:** Score of 0 is appropriate.\n  - **Conclusion:** Safe, internal utilities.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's purpose—internal utilities manipulating SQLAlchemy internals without any malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward, albeit using internal APIs.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly moderate (0.2), reflecting reliance on internal APIs that may change but not indicating security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- It heavily relies on internal, non-public APIs of SQLAlchemy, which can be unstable but are not inherently malicious.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or system compromise is evident.\n- The manipulations are for advanced result processing, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — moderate due to internal API reliance, but not security-threatening.\n\n**In conclusion**, the code appears to be a set of internal utility functions for advanced SQLAlchemy result handling, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with this assessment.",
