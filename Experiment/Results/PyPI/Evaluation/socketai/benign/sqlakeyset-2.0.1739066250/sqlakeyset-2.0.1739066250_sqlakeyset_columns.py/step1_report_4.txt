  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for managing ordering columns and extracting keyset markers from SQLAlchemy query results, primarily for pagination and sorting purposes.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from query clauses, columns, and expressions within SQLAlchemy ORM queries and expressions.",
  "sinks": "Data extraction from query result rows; expression manipulation for order clauses; potential propagation of untrusted data into order expressions.",
  "flows": "Input data from query descriptions flows into derive_order_key and find_order_key functions, influencing how ordering columns are represented and used in comparisons. These influence the formation of SQL expressions and result row parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code manipulates SQL expressions and order clauses, which is expected for its purpose. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation present. Warning exists about nulls in order columns but is a standard caution and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes and functions to parse and manipulate SQLAlchemy order clauses, including safe handling of labels and order directions. It clones and reverses order expressions, removing direction modifiers and labels for comparison. It includes warnings for nullable columns to prevent incorrect ordering. The functions derive order keys and map order columns to query columns or attributes, adding extra columns if needed. No signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or hidden backdoors are evident. The code is focused on expression handling and data extraction related to database queries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing SQLAlchemy order clauses and extracting keyset markers, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It performs expected tasks related to query ordering and pagination. No security risks or malware detected.",
