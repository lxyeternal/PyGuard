  "sources": "Query descriptions, ColumnElement objects, result rows, and query expressions.",
  "sinks": "Generation and modification of SQLAlchemy expression objects, especially ORDER BY clauses and comparable key expressions.",
  "flows": "Input query descriptions and expressions are parsed into OC objects; these are used to generate order clauses and extract key values from result rows.",
  "anomalies": "Use of private APIs (_clone, _copy_internals) which could be unstable but are not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to handling SQLAlchemy order clauses, including parsing, reversing, and stripping order modifiers. It employs standard expression manipulation techniques, with warnings for nullable columns and unsupported nulls modifiers. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are present. Use of internal APIs is noted but is typical for advanced expression handling. The code's purpose aligns with safe query manipulation, and no network activity or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SQLAlchemy query ordering and pagination. It does not exhibit any malicious or sabotage behavior. The scores are consistent: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk approximately 0.2 due to internal API use and potential for misuse if inputs are crafted maliciously, but no malicious intent is evident.",
