  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for SQLAlchemy query ordering and pagination. It does not exhibit any malicious or sabotage behavior. The scores are consistent: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk approximately 0.2 due to internal API use and potential for misuse if inputs are crafted maliciously, but no malicious intent is evident."
