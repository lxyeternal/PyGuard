{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an API surface module, aggregating and re-exporting components from internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.paging, .results, .serial, .types).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling; purely static import/export statements.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static symbol re-exports only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list, typical for a package's __init__.py or module index. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to organize and expose internal components for external use. The static nature and lack of external interactions confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module that functions as an API surface, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.",
