{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be part of a larger library related to paging, serialization, and type definitions for handling data navigation and serialization errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.paging, .results, .serial, .types), which are likely local or part of the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code exports functions and classes, but no untrusted data handling or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows involving untrusted input; primarily imports and exports of modules and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or module index.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list, which controls namespace exports. There is no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external communication. It appears to be a standard module setup for a package, organizing available symbols for external use. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package module initializer with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply organizes and exposes components for other parts of the package or external users. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
