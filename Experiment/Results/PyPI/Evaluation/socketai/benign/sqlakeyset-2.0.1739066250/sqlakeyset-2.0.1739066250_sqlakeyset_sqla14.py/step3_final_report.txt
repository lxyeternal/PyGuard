  "purpose": "Internal utility functions for manipulating SQLAlchemy result rows, especially for handling legacy and truncated formats.",
  "sources": "Reads internal attributes such as _parent, _keymap, _data from SQLAlchemy row objects.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed internally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Accesses source attributes (_parent, _keymap, _data) and returns modified row objects; no external data flow or output.",
  "anomalies": "Uses private internal attributes without validation; no sanitization or error handling for attribute presence or structure.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates internal SQLAlchemy row internals to support legacy and truncated data formats. It does not perform external communication, nor does it contain obfuscation or malicious code. The use of private attributes (_parent, _keymap, _data) could lead to fragility if SQLAlchemy internals change, but this is typical for internal utilities. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The code is straightforward and purpose-driven, with scores reflecting low security risk and no malware suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate internal utility for handling SQLAlchemy result rows, with no malicious behavior or security concerns. The main consideration is maintainability due to reliance on internal attributes, but this does not constitute a security risk.",
