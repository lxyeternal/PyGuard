{
  "purpose": "The code provides methods to manipulate internal SQLAlchemy result rows, specifically for trimming extra columns and handling legacy row formats.",
  "sources": "Imports from SQLAlchemy modules, constants, and functions; method parameters such as 'row', 'extra_columns', and 'result_type'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks like network, file, or system calls; manipulation of result rows is internal and does not involve untrusted input processing or external data flows.",
  "flows": "The 'core_coerce_row' function receives a row and processes it based on its type, trimming extra columns and creating a new row object, with no external data sinks or malicious data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code modifies internal SQLAlchemy row objects, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on internal manipulation of SQLAlchemy result rows, specifically trimming and handling legacy row types. It checks the row's type, processes parent metadata, and creates new row instances accordingly. No external inputs are processed, and there are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code’s purpose appears to be for internal library use or advanced result set handling, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to modify and handle SQLAlchemy result rows internally, without any signs of malicious behavior. It does not include any network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The manipulation of internal objects is typical for advanced database handling and does not indicate malicious intent.",
