{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and class extensions to manipulate SQLAlchemy result rows, specifically for handling legacy and truncated result sets.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from SQLAlchemy row objects, particularly in the core_coerce_row function, and from imported constants and classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential data modification occurs in the creation of TruncatedLegacyRow and TruncatedRow instances, which modify row data and keymaps.",
  "flows": "Input data from SQLAlchemy row objects flows into core_coerce_row, which may truncate or modify rows before returning custom row instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code performs data transformations without external communication or system access.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates SQLAlchemy result rows by truncating extra columns and creating custom row objects, handling legacy and new result formats. It references internal SQLAlchemy classes and functions, but does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The operations are straightforward data transformations with no evidence of malicious intent. There are no obfuscated code patterns or suspicious imports; all functions serve clear, legitimate purposes related to query result handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions aimed at modifying or truncating SQLAlchemy result rows for internal use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The code's intent aligns with internal data processing without external communication or harmful actions.",
