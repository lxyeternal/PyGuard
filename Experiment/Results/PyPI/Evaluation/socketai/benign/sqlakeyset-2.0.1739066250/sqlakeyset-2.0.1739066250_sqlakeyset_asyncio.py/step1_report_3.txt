{
  "purpose": "The code provides asynchronous functions to retrieve paginated results from a SQLAlchemy query, supporting keyset pagination with optional navigation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters from function arguments such as 'selectable', 'per_page', 'place', 'page', 'after', 'before'. Uses external modules for SQL construction and execution.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL queries via 's.execute()'. Retrieves keys and rows from query results, processes keysets, and constructs pages. No external data output or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (selectable, pagination arguments) flow into 'process_args' and 'prepare_paging', which produce SQL statements. The 'execute' method runs the SQL, and results are processed into a Page object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or suspicious data handling. The use of external libraries appears standard for pagination. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard async SQLAlchemy practices for paginated data retrieval, including keyset handling. It depends on external, well-known libraries (sqlakeyset, SQLAlchemy) with no signs of malicious manipulation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The functions perform typical data access patterns without suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of asynchronous pagination using SQLAlchemy, with no malicious intent or malicious code. It relies on external, trusted libraries and follows standard patterns. No security risks or malware detected.",
