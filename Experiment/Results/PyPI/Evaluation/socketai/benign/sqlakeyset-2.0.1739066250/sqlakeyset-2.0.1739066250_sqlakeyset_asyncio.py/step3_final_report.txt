{
  "purpose": "Provides async pagination for SQLAlchemy queries using external libraries, ensuring efficient data retrieval with support for keyset pagination.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'selectable', 'after', 'before', 'page', and the database connection/session reading data and keyset arguments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the constructed SQL query via 's.execute()', which interacts with the database, returning result sets.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed into a query object, which is then executed; results are fetched and processed into a Page object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Usage relies on trusted external libraries with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard async pagination using SQLAlchemy and sqlakeyset, with input validation and safe query construction. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The query execution relies on parameterized methods, reducing injection risk. External libraries are well-established, and no network activity or code injection is observed. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of async pagination for SQLAlchemy, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the safe and conventional nature of the code.",
