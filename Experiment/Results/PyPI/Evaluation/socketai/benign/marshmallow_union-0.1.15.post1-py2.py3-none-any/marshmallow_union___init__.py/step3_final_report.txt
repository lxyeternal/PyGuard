{
  "purpose": "A custom marshmallow field 'Union' that sequentially attempts to serialize or deserialize using multiple candidate fields, collecting errors and raising an exception if all fail.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to the '_serialize' and 'deserialize' methods; candidate fields during serialization/deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Error collection via 'error_store.store_error'; raising 'ExceptionGroup' or 'ValidationError' upon failure of all candidates.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into candidate fields during serialization/deserialization; errors are stored; if all candidates fail, errors are raised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of protected method '_serialize' in candidate fields, which is typical but slightly unconventional; no external system calls or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a 'Union' field that tries multiple candidate fields for serialization/deserialization, catching exceptions, storing errors, and raising an exception if all candidates fail. It uses standard marshmallow practices, including error handling with 'ErrorStore' and raising 'ValidationError'. The use of '_serialize' is typical in custom marshmallow fields. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The exception handling and error collection are straightforward. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the static analysis, indicating a benign, standard extension with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a marshmallow 'Union' field with proper error handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk scores are justified, and the implementation is safe for use.",
