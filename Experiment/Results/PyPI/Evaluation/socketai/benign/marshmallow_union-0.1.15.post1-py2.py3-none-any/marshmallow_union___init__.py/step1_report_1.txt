{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom marshmallow field 'Union' that tries multiple candidate fields for serialization and deserialization, handling exceptions and errors.",
  "sources": "Input data for serialization/deserialization; error data stored in ErrorStore during serialization attempts.",
  "sinks": "ErrorStore.store_error method during _serialize; raising ValidationError during _deserialize.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input values to candidate fields for serialization/deserialization; errors are collected and possibly raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected. The code uses standard marshmallow classes and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom marshmallow field that sequentially attempts to serialize/deserialize data using multiple candidate fields, catching and storing errors. Exception handling is standard; error collection is via marshmallow's ErrorStore. No external network calls, file system access, or malicious patterns are present. The error handling and use of standard marshmallow classes indicate a normal implementation for a custom field. No signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a composite marshmallow field with error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its static code analysis.",
