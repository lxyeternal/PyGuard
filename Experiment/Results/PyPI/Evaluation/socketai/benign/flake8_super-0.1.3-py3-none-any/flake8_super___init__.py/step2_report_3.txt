  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Risks**  \nAll reports describe a simple import statement: `from flake8_super.plugin import SuperPlugin`.  \nThere is no dynamic code execution, no data processing, no user input handling, and no network or file system operations. The code is purely a static import, which is a common pattern in Python for plugin or module inclusion.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior**  \nNo report indicates any suspicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies beyond the minimal import statement. The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious—no code injection, no data exfiltration, no runtime code generation.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment: they all correctly identify the code as benign and standard. No logical flaws or errors are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, correctly reflecting the lack of malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores**  \nSince the code is only an import statement, it does not warrant a higher risk score. The import itself is not inherently risky; it depends on what `SuperPlugin` does, but that is outside the scope of this minimal snippet.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n- The reports do not assume or suggest any hidden malicious intent or malicious payloads.  \n- No signs of obfuscation or code hiding are present.  \n- The code appears to be part of a plugin setup, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (appropriate)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (appropriate)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (appropriate)\n\nThere are no indications of malicious or security-critical issues in this code snippet. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no security risks. All scores and conclusions are appropriate given the minimal and standard nature of the code.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
