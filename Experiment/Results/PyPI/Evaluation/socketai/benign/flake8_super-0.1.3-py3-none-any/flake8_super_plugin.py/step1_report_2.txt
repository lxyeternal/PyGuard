  "purpose": "A linter plugin for flake8 that enforces the use of `super()` without arguments in Python classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own source from the module and the `flake8_plugin_utils` library.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data, no data leaks, or external calls.",
  "flows": "The code processes abstract syntax tree (AST) nodes to identify deprecated `super()` calls.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. No suspicious external network activity or data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom error and visitor classes for a flake8 plugin to catch deprecated `super()` calls with arguments. It performs AST analysis without external input or dangerous operations. No signs of malware or malicious intent. The code structure is typical for a plugin, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign flake8 plugin aimed at code style enforcement. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
