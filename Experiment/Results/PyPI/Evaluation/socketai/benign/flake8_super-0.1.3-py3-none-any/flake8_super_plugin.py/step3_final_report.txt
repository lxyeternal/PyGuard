{
  "purpose": "A static analysis plugin for flake8 that detects calls to super() with arguments and suggests using super() without arguments for style consistency.",
  "sources": "AST Call nodes where the function is named 'super' and has arguments",
  "sinks": "Error raising when 'super' is called with arguments",
  "flows": "AST Call node -> check function name and args -> raise error if 'super' with args",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward AST inspection, no obfuscation or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code inspects AST Call nodes, identifies calls to 'super' with arguments, and raises a style error. It is simple, correct, and performs static code style enforcement without external data or malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or runtime effects are present. The logic is precise and aligns with its purpose, with no false positives expected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward static analysis plugin for style enforcement, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
