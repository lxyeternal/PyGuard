{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static analysis plugin for flake8 that enforces the use of `super()` without arguments in Python classes.",
  "sources": "Input data is not explicitly read from external sources; the code analyzes Python AST nodes during static code analysis.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications; it only raises errors within the analysis process.",
  "flows": "The flow is from analyzing AST nodes (`Call` nodes) and raising errors if certain patterns are detected; there are no external data flows or untrusted data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; the code performs straightforward static code analysis for style enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AST node types and utility classes for static analysis. It defines an error class for disallowed `super()` usage with arguments. The visitor class inspects function call nodes to detect `super(__class__, self)` patterns and raises an error if found. The plugin registers this visitor for flake8. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code execution. The code is purely for linting purposes, ensuring code style consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis plugin intended to enforce a coding style guideline in Python projects. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
