{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom plugin for flake8 to enforce the use of 'super()' instead of the explicit form 'super(__class__, self)' in Python code.",
  "sources": "The code reads static definitions of classes, methods, and function calls within the plugin itself; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not handle external data or perform IO operations.",
  "flows": "The code's flow is limited to static code analysis: it inspects AST nodes to identify specific function call patterns; no data flow from untrusted sources exists.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward, static, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a static analysis plugin that scans Python code for a specific pattern ('super' calls with arguments) and reports it. It imports AST and typing modules, as well as a flake8 plugin utility library. The classes define an error class, a visitor to traverse AST nodes, and the plugin configuration. The visitor checks for calls to 'super' with arguments and raises an error if found. The plugin setup is standard, with no external data handling or malicious operations. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent; the code is purely for code style enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless static analysis plugin for Python code style enforcement. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk score is negligible, and there are no anomalies suggesting malicious intent.",
