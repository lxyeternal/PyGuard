{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom plugin for flake8 to enforce the use of 'super()' without arguments in Python classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from '_ast', 'typing', and 'flake8_plugin_utils'; class and method definitions; code execution occurs during plugin import and run time within the flake8 tool.",
  "sinks": "Error reporting mechanism within 'flake8_plugin_utils'; error is generated if pattern detected, but no external data sinks or external network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The plugin inspects AST nodes during flake8's analysis; when a 'Call' node matches 'super' with arguments, it triggers an error; no data flows outside the analysis context.",
  "anomalies": "The plugin enforces a specific coding style rule; no anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a flake8 plugin that visits AST nodes to identify deprecated 'super' calls with arguments, encouraging cleaner code. It uses standard plugin patterns with no external data handling, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. No data injection, external network, or malicious payloads are detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical static analysis plugin design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis plugin designed to improve code style by discouraging outdated 'super' usage. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
