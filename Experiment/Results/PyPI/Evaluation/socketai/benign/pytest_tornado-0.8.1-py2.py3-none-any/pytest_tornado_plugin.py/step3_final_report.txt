  "purpose": "Provides pytest fixtures and utility functions for testing Tornado web applications, managing async test support, server setup (HTTP/HTTPS), and clients, with configuration via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for timeouts, fixture inputs for app and SSL options, network sockets for server binding.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets for server/client communication, environment variables for configuration, fixture data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence timeout settings; fixtures create servers and clients; network sockets are used for server binding; async functions manage test execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code follows standard testing patterns without suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup for testing Tornado web applications using pytest fixtures. It manages environment-based configuration, server lifecycle, and async test execution. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The use of environment variables for configuration is typical and not malicious. The code is readable, well-structured, and aligns with common testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing infrastructure for Tornado applications. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
