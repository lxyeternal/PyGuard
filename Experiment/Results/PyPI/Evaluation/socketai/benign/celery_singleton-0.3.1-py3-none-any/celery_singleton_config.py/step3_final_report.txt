{
  "purpose": "Configuration handler that dynamically loads backend classes, retrieves URLs, and manages singleton settings based on application configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration parameters accessed via self.app.conf.get(), class path string for dynamic import.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of classes using import_module and getattr, URL retrieval for backend connections.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are read; if class path is a string, it is split and imported; URLs are selected based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; minimal validation on URLs and class paths.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration reading and dynamic class loading, which is common but can be risky if configuration is untrusted. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is the potential for exploitation if configuration inputs are manipulated, but the code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration loader with dynamic import capabilities. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from reliance on trusted configuration sources; if these are compromised, it could lead to code execution. Overall, the code is safe when used with validated configuration, with a moderate risk level due to dynamic import.",
