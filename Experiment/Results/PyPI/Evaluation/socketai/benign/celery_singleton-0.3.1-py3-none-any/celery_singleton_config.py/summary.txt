  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration loader with dynamic import capabilities. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from reliance on trusted configuration sources; if these are compromised, it could lead to code execution. Overall, the code is safe when used with validated configuration, with a moderate risk level due to dynamic import."
