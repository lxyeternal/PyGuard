  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and designed solely for generating lock keys. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The use of MD5 is acceptable here for non-security-critical purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Minor cleanup could remove the redundant assignment, but it does not impact security or functionality."
