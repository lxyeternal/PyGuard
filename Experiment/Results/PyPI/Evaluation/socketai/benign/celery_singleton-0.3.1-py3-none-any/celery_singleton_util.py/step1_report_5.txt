  "purpose": "Generate a unique lock key based on task name and arguments for synchronization purposes.",
  "sources": "task_name, task_args, task_kwargs",
  "sinks": "Return statement concatenating key_prefix and task_hash",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> JSON serialization -> MD5 hash -> Concatenate with prefix -> Return",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a string from task parameters, serializes them, hashes the combined string with MD5, and returns a prefixed lock key. The use of MD5 for hashing is not ideal for security but is acceptable for non-cryptographic purposes like generating unique identifiers. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no external network interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a simple lock key generator using predictable hashing; there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and does not involve obfuscation or malicious intent.",
