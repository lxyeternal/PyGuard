  "purpose": "Generate a deterministic lock key based on task name, arguments, and keyword arguments, serialized into JSON and hashed with MD5, with an optional prefix.",
  "sources": "task_name, task_args, task_kwargs, key_prefix",
  "sinks": "None; data flows only within the function for hash generation",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> JSON serialization -> Concatenation with task_name -> MD5 hashing -> Return key with prefix",
  "anomalies": "Redundant assignment 'key_prefix = key_prefix' which has no effect",
  "analysis": "The code serializes input arguments into JSON with sorted keys, concatenates with task_name, hashes the result with MD5, and prepends a prefix. The only anomaly is the redundant assignment, which is harmless. Use of MD5 is not cryptographically secure but acceptable for generating non-sensitive identifiers. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The logic is straightforward and purpose-driven, with no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and designed solely for generating lock keys. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The use of MD5 is acceptable here for non-security-critical purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Minor cleanup could remove the redundant assignment, but it does not impact security or functionality.",
