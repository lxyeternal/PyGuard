  "purpose": "Generate a unique lock key based on task details for use in synchronization or distributed locking.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: task_name, task_args, task_kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Returns a string key; no untrusted data directly processed beyond inputs.",
  "flows": "Inputs (task_name, task_args, task_kwargs) are serialized and hashed, then concatenated with a prefix to produce the key.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code constructs, no obfuscated or malicious behavior. The code uses standard libraries and functions.",
  "analysis": "The function serializes task arguments and keyword arguments into JSON strings, sorts keys to ensure consistency, then combines these with the task name to compute an MD5 hash. The resulting hash is concatenated with a prefix to create a unique lock key. This process is straightforward, predictable, and intended for generating reproducible identifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The use of MD5, while not cryptographically secure for sensitive data, is acceptable for generating non-security-critical unique identifiers in this context. The code does not contain any code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for generating a deterministic lock key from task details. It appears benign and purpose-driven without any malicious intent or security issues.",
