  "purpose": "Import singleton pattern and exception handling components, and define the package version.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks, no output operations, and no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; the code only performs imports and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules, which suggests modular design. The only additional statement sets a version string. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious commands, or insecure behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward module setup segment, with no external network calls, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as part of a package's initial setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
