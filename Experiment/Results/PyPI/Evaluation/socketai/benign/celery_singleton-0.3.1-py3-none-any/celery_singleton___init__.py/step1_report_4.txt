{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module metadata and imports specific classes and functions from local modules, likely part of a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from singleton and exceptions modules, and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and sets a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and a version declaration. It does not process input, perform network operations, or manipulate data in a way that could introduce security risks. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module initialization snippet, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply imports components and defines a version number, indicating standard module setup.",
