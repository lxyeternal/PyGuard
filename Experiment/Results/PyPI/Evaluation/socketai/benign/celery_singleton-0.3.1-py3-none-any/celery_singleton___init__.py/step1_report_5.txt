  "purpose": "Import singleton management and custom exception handling for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Imports from singleton.py (Singleton, clear_locks) and exceptions.py (DuplicateTaskError).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; only imports and version declaration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; code only imports modules and sets a version.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules, likely for managing singleton instances and exceptions. It also sets a version string. No input handling, external data processing, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears standard and straightforward, serving as part of a larger codebase's setup or initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues. It is a typical import and version declaration snippet with no apparent security risks.",
