  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores:\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is minimal: only import statements and a version string.\n- No data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree on benign nature, with high confidence scores (mostly 0.9 or 1).\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import singleton and exception classes, set version.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar import and version setup.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Slightly above zero, but given the benign code, this is acceptable as a low risk.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 3\n- Same pattern, benign code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 4\n- Same as above, benign setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n### Report 5\n- Same pattern, straightforward import and version.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the version string or import statements, but given the benign nature, a risk score of 0.1 is reasonable for potential future concerns, but not indicative of actual security risk.\n\n**However,** since the code is purely import statements and version declaration, **a risk score of 0.1 might be slightly overstated**. It could be set to 0 for clarity, unless the scoring system considers version strings or import statements as potential vectors (which they are not in this context).\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Set to 0 for all reports, as there's no real security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n---\n\n### **Final note:**\n\nThe code is benign, and the scores should reflect that. The current scores are mostly appropriate, but for clarity and consistency, I recommend setting the security risk to 0 across all reports. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly 0.\n\n**Work out complete.**",
