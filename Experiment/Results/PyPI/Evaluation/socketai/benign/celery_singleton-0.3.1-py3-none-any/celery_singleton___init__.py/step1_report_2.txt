  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that manages singleton patterns and custom exceptions, likely for internal use within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing modules '.singleton' and '.exceptions', which are local to the package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in this snippet; no data processing or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is visible in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. The version string is a standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and classes from local modules, indicating modular design. The only other statement sets a version string. No code executes dynamic or malicious behavior; no network operations, data handling, or security-sensitive actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a typical part of a Python package setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves to import dependencies and set a version identifier. Overall, it appears benign.",
