{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules and sets a version string, serving as a module setup or configuration file.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.singleton and .exceptions), setting __version__",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external input, or output operations present",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process data or pass data from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a version string assignment. There are no data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The import statements are from local modules, typical in package setup. The version string is a standard practice. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate benign intent, with no security issues or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import statements and version declaration are standard and safe. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score can be confidently set to 0, reflecting the absence of security concerns.",
