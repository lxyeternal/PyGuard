  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- The code is minimal, only import statements and a version string.  \n- No data flows, sinks, or anomalies.  \n- The confidence is high (0.9), and the malware score is 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or security risk. The report's conclusion is accurate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on modular design and no suspicious patterns.  \n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), possibly due to the version string being set, but no actual vulnerabilities.  \n- Malware score remains 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior. The risk score is reasonable, though perhaps slightly conservative.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same pattern: imports and version assignment, no data processing or external communication.  \n- Confidence is perfect (1.0), malware score 0.  \n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, and the report's conclusion is justified.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar minimal setup, no anomalies or suspicious behavior.  \n- Slightly elevated security risk (0.1), consistent with previous reports.  \n- Malware score 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent detected.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same as above, straightforward import and version declaration.  \n- No issues, malware score 0.  \n- **Assessment:** No security concerns.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely import statements and a version string, with no data flows, sinks, or anomalies.  \n- **Malware Score:** All are zero, consistent with the code's benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports, which is accurate.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1) in some reports, likely due to the presence of version strings, but these are standard practice and do not introduce security risks.  \n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as there is no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly at 0.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a score of 0.1 in some reports is acceptable but could be lowered to 0 to reflect the absence of any risk.  \n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.  \n- The scores assigned are reasonable, though the security risk could be lowered to 0 for more accuracy.  \n- The overall risk is negligible, and the malware score should stay at 0.  \n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code's nature.",
