{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and functions related to singleton pattern management and custom exception handling, and sets a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.singleton and .exceptions)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only imports and assigns a version string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a version declaration. It does not process input, handle untrusted data, or perform any operations that could lead to security risks. The imports suggest modular design, but without further context, there are no indications of malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module import and version assignment with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
