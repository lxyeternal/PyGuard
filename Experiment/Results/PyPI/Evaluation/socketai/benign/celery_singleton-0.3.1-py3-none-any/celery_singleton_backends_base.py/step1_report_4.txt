  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for lock management backends with methods for locking, unlocking, retrieving, and clearing locks.",
  "sources": "None (no input data reading functions or external data sources).",
  "targets": "None (no direct data sinks, no data transmission, no external calls).",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data pathways are present; methods are abstract with no implementation details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract class with method signatures for lock management, including docstrings describing parameters and return types. It contains only method declarations with no implementations or executable code. No input/output, network communication, or data manipulation is present. The class appears to serve as a template or interface for other implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract base class for lock handling, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior. It functions purely as an interface. No anomalies or malicious features detected.",
