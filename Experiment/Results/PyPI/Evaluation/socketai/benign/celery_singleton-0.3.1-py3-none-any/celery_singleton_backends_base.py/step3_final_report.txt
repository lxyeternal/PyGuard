{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for lock management backends with methods for locking, unlocking, retrieving, and clearing locks.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as lock identifiers, task IDs, expiry times, and key prefixes; all are string types provided as method arguments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; the code contains only method signatures and docstrings without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no actual data flows or execution paths, as the class is purely abstract with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a pure abstract base class defining method signatures for lock operations, with detailed docstrings. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The absence of implementation, secrets, or dynamic code indicates no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign, interface-only nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface for lock management with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
