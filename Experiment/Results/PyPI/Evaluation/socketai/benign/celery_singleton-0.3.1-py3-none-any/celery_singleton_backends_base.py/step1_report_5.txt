  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for backend lock management with methods for locking, unlocking, retrieving, and clearing locks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in method definitions (lock, task_id, expiry, key_prefix).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows beyond method parameter definitions; no execution flow outside method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; code adheres to standard abstract class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with method signatures for lock management. All methods are abstract and contain only documentation strings. No implementation code, data handling, or external interactions are present. No signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flows, or obfuscation are detected. The structure is typical for an interface or abstract class in Python, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of an abstract lock backend interface. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks in this module.",
