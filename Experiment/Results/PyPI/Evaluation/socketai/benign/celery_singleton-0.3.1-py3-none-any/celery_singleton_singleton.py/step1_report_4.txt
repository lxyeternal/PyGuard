  "purpose": "Define a Celery task class with singleton behavior, lock management, and duplicate handling.",
  "sources": "Imports (celery, kombu, inspect), class attributes, method parameters, and calls to external modules like get_backend, util.generate_lock.",
  "sinks": "Lock acquisition and release via singleton_backend.lock/unlock, generate_lock, and application of tasks via super().apply_async.",
  "flows": "Methods generate locks, acquire locks, execute tasks, handle duplicates, and release locks. Input data (task args, kwargs) flows into lock generation and lock acquisition, and results flow into task execution and lock release.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of locking mechanism seems standard for singleton task management. No unusual network activity, system modifications, or data leaks observed. The code does handle exceptions to release locks properly.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a singleton pattern for Celery tasks, managing distributed locks via a backend. It generates locks based on task arguments, preventing duplicate task execution. Locking mechanisms and exception handling appear standard. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions. External dependencies are used for standard functionalities like UUID and inspect. The code maintains proper lock release in success/failure scenarios, indicating careful resource management. Overall, the logic and structure are consistent with legitimate task management patterns without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of singleton task control with lock management for Celery. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious data handling are detected. It follows standard patterns for distributed locking and task execution, with appropriate exception handling. The code's purpose is to ensure only one instance of a task runs at a time, with proper duplicate handling and lock cleanup.",
