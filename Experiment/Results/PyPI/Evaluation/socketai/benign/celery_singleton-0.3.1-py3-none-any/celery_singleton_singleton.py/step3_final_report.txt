  "purpose": "Implements a distributed singleton pattern for Celery tasks, managing locks to prevent duplicate execution.",
  "sources": "Config retrieval, backend lock methods, task arguments, and task name for lock generation.",
  "sinks": "Lock acquisition and release functions, duplicate detection, and exception handling pathways.",
  "flows": "Generate lock from task parameters -> acquire lock -> run task -> release lock on success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; external dependencies are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code manages distributed locks for Celery tasks, ensuring singleton execution. It properly handles lock acquisition, release, and duplicate detection with exception safety. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. External modules (get_backend, util.generate_lock) are used for lock management, which could be supply chain vectors but are not malicious within this code. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The security risk score is 0.2, considering reliance on external lock backends, but no direct vulnerabilities are found. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented singleton task pattern with proper lock management. No signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are present. The supply chain concern remains external to this code but does not imply malicious intent.",
