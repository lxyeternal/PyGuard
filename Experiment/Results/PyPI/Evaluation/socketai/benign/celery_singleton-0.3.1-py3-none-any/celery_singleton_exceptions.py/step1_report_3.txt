  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling singleton and duplicate task errors in Celery",
  "sources": "Class definitions and the __init__ method that assigns task_id and calls superclass __init__",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data flows present in the code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only defines exception classes without external data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, inheriting from Exception and a base exception. It properly initializes exception attributes and includes descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward, standard Python exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
