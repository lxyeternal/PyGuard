  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Celery task errors, specifically for singleton and duplicate task scenarios.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, __init__ method assigning task_id, superclass Exception initialization.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no external data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of DuplicateTaskError with message and task_id; no data flow to external systems or insecure handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions inheriting from built-in Exception. The DuplicateTaskError stores a task_id but does not process or transmit it insecurely. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code is standard for exception handling in Python, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for exception handling and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no suspicious patterns.",
