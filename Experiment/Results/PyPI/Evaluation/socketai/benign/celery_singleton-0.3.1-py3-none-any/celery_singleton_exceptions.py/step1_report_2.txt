  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to Celery task management",
  "sources": "Class definitions, constructor method initializing attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not handle or process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; class constructors assign values without external input processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard class inheritance and exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception. 'DuplicateTaskError' captures a message and task ID, but does not process external input or perform any operations that could be malicious. The implementation is straightforward and aligns with common Python practices for custom exceptions. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to facilitate error handling in Celery task management but does not introduce any vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.",
