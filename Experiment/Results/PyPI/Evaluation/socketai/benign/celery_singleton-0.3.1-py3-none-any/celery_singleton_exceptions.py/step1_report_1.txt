  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to Celery task management.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and the constructor method (__init__) for DuplicateTaskError.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data flows to external systems are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The comment typo 'duplicat' instead of 'duplicate' is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces custom exceptions inheriting from Exception, specifically for Celery task error handling. The DuplicateTaskError class stores a task_id, which could be useful for debugging or logging but does not process or handle untrusted data in a security-sensitive manner. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code features. The code appears straightforward, focusing solely on exception handling logic with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for Celery task errors. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
