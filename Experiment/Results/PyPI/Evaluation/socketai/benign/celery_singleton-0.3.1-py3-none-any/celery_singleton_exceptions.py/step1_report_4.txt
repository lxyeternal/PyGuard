  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific Celery task errors, including duplicate task attempts.",
  "sources": "Class and method definitions that set exception messages and store task identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines exceptions and does not perform data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are used for control flow in other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, inheriting from Python's Exception. 'DuplicateTaskError' captures a message and task ID, likely used in a Celery task management context. The class is straightforward, with no external data input/output, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior. There are no external connections, network calls, or data leaks within this snippet. The only potential concern is if the exception is misused elsewhere, but based on this code alone, there are no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines exception classes with no malicious or security-related behavior. It appears to be standard, safe Python code for handling task-related errors.",
