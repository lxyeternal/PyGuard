{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Celery task management, specifically for handling duplicate task errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception classes are instantiated with message and task_id parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external outputs; exception attributes are stored internally.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation with message and task_id, with no external data transmission or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in comment ('duplicat' instead of 'duplicate'), but this is benign and non-security relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward exception classes with no external data handling, network calls, or malicious constructs. The 'DuplicateTaskError' stores a task_id attribute, which could be used elsewhere but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or security issues are present. The comments contain a minor typo, but it does not impact functionality or security. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for Celery tasks. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
