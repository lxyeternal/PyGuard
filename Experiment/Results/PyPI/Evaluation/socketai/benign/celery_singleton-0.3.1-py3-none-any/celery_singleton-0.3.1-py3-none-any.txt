      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import statements and version declaration are standard and safe. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score can be confidently set to 0, reflecting the absence of security concerns."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration loader with dynamic import capabilities. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from reliance on trusted configuration sources; if these are compromised, it could lead to code execution. Overall, the code is safe when used with validated configuration, with a moderate risk level due to dynamic import."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and designed solely for generating lock keys. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The use of MD5 is acceptable here for non-security-critical purposes. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Minor cleanup could remove the redundant assignment, but it does not impact security or functionality."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and implements a common pattern. The main security concern is external configuration trustworthiness. Scores of malware 0 and obfuscated 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of around 0.2-0.3 accurately reflects the potential for malicious configuration manipulation, but no malicious activity is present within the code. Overall, the code is safe if configuration inputs are trusted and validated externally."
