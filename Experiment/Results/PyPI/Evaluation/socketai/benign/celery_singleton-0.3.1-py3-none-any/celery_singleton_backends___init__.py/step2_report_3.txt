  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports backend classes.\n- Uses a global cache `_backend`.\n- Provides a `get_backend(config)` function that:\n  - Checks if `_backend` exists; if so, returns it.\n  - Otherwise, instantiates a backend class specified by `config.backend_class` with parameters `config.backend_url` and `config.backend_kwargs`.\n  - Caches and returns the instance.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Relies on external configuration for class and URL.\n- Uses dynamic class instantiation (`klass(url, **kwargs)`).\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or embedded malicious code.\n- Security depends on the trustworthiness of the configuration data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports mainly highlight that the code's behavior depends on external configuration, which could be manipulated. They correctly identify that the code itself does not contain malicious logic but could be exploited if configuration is malicious.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No significant logical errors are evident. The use of a global variable for caching is straightforward, though it might have concurrency issues in multi-threaded environments, but that's outside the scope of security review here.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code not executing any malicious or obfuscated code directly. The security risk scores are around 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the dependency on external configuration trustworthiness.\n\n- **Justify risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.3, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of embedded malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware scores?**  \n  All reports correctly identify malware score as 0, which aligns with the code not containing malware.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports reasonably assume that malicious configuration could lead to misuse, which is a standard concern with dynamic class instantiation based on external input.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The code is a typical factory with caching, relying on external configuration.\n- The main security concern is the trustworthiness of `config.backend_class`, `config.backend_url`, and `config.backend_kwargs`.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code is present.\n- The potential for malicious behavior is external to this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code present)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 to 0.3 (depends on trust in configuration data)\n\n**Overall,** the code is a standard pattern with minimal security issues, primarily dependent on external configuration trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The main security consideration is ensuring that configuration data is validated and trusted before use. No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to external configuration reliance)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's straightforward nature.",
