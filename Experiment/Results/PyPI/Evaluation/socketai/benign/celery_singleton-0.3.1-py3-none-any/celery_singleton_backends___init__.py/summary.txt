  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign and implements a common pattern. The main security concern is external configuration trustworthiness. Scores of malware 0 and obfuscated 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of around 0.2-0.3 accurately reflects the potential for malicious configuration manipulation, but no malicious activity is present within the code. Overall, the code is safe if configuration inputs are trusted and validated externally."
