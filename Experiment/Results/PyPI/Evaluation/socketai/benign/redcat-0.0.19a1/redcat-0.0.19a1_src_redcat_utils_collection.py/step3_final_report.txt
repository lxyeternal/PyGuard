  "purpose": "Convert various data types (list, tuple, Tensor, ndarray, BaseBatch) into a Python list for standardized data handling.",
  "sources": "Type checks on 'data' (isinstance), accessing 'data.data' for BaseBatch, calling 'tolist()' on Tensor or ndarray, fallback to 'list(data)'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; function only performs in-memory conversions without external I/O or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input 'data' flows through type checks, then is converted via 'tolist()' or 'list()' depending on type; fallback assumes 'data' is iterable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard library functions; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple, type-based conversions to produce a list. It handles common data types used in numerical and batch processing, with no external side effects or malicious code. The logic is correct and safe, relying on standard practices. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The fallback 'list(data)' assumes 'data' is iterable, which is typical and not malicious. The overall design is benign and intended for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility function for data conversion, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current security scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
