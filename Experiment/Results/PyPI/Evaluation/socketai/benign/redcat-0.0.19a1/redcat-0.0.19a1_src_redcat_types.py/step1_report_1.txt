  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various index and random number generator types used in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements, conditional imports based on availability of numpy and torch, and type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data processing directly involving untrusted inputs; type aliases do not execute code or handle data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines types and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. Usage of Mock objects for optional dependencies is standard for conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type aliases and handles optional dependencies via conditional imports. The use of Mock for unavailable libraries is a common pattern. No code execution, data handling, or network operations are present. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward type definition file for indexing and RNG types with conditional handling of dependencies. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
