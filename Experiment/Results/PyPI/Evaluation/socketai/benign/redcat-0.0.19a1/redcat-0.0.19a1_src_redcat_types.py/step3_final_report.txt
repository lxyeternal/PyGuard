  "purpose": "Define type aliases for index and RNG types with optional dependencies for numpy and torch, handling their absence gracefully.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports of numpy and torch, which may be absent; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, no external communication or data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; static type alias definitions with conditional imports, no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of unittest.mock.Mock() as fallback for optional dependencies is standard; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setting type aliases for indexing and RNG types, with conditional imports of numpy and torch. When these libraries are unavailable, Mock objects are used to prevent import errors. There is no data processing, network activity, or code execution. The use of mocks is a common pattern for optional dependencies and does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is static and solely for type annotations, posing no runtime security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of mocks for optional dependencies is standard practice. All assessments and scores are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0.",
