  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code defines type aliases for indexing and RNG types, with conditional imports of numpy and torch.\n- It uses `Mock()` as fallbacks when dependencies are unavailable, which is a common pattern to avoid import errors.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, no code execution, and no handling of external data.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- The code is static, primarily for type annotations, and does not perform runtime logic beyond imports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward; no issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The use of `Mock()` for optional dependencies is standard for handling optional packages and does not introduce security risks.\n- No code execution, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or mistakes are apparent.\n- The only point to note is that using `Mock()` for dependencies might lead to runtime issues if these mocks are used improperly elsewhere, but this is outside the scope of this code.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very low scores (~0.9). Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; the code is benign.\n- The highest assigned risk score is 0.9, which seems slightly conservative but still reasonable given the use of mocks, which could theoretically cause runtime issues if misused, but not security risks.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n- The use of mocks is standard for optional dependencies and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Overall, the code is a benign, standard type alias definition module with conditional dependencies.**  \n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0  \n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. No changes are necessary.",
