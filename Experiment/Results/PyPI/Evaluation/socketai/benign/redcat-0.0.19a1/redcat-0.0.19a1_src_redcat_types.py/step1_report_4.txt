{
  "purpose": "Define types for indexing, sequences, and random number generators used in a larger module.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, standard library modules (random, collections.abc, typing), unittest.mock, and conditional imports of numpy and torch based on availability.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present. No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; type definitions are static and do not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Mock objects for numpy and torch when not available is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The code is straightforward, primarily type annotations and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines type aliases for various index, sequence, and RNG types. Conditional imports of numpy and torch with Mock fallback suggest compatibility handling but do not introduce malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code serves as type definitions for a larger framework, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly defining type aliases with conditional imports. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks detected.",
