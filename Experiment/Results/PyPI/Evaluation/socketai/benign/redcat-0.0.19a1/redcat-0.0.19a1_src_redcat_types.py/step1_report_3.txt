{
  "purpose": "Define various type aliases for indexing and random number generators, with conditional imports based on availability of numpy and torch.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports of numpy and torch modules; usage of is_numpy_available() and is_torch_available() functions; import of random, collections.abc, and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly defines types and performs conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Mock objects as fallbacks for numpy and torch when these libraries are unavailable is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases for various index and RNG types. It conditionally imports numpy and torch, substituting mock objects if they are not available, which is a common practice to handle optional dependencies. No external input handling, network communication, or malicious code is present. The use of 'Mock' does not introduce malicious behavior; it simply prevents import errors. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type definition module with conditional dependencies. It does not contain malicious intent or security risks. The use of mocks is benign and intended for compatibility.",
