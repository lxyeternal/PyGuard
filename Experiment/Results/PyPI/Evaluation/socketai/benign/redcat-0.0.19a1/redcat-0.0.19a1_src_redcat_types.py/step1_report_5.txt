{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for indexing, sequence indices, and random number generators used in the larger project.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions, imports, conditional imports for numpy and torch, and module-level variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; type aliases are static and not runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed. Usage of mocks for optional libraries is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type aliases and imports modules conditionally based on availability. It uses mocks for optional dependencies (numpy and torch) when not installed, which is a common pattern. No dynamic execution, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code's structure is straightforward, and it does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard type alias definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles optional dependencies safely and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
