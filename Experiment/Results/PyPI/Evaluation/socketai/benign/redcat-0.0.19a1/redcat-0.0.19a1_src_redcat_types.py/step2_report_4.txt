  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily defining type aliases for indexing and RNG types.\n- The code uses conditional imports of numpy and torch, substituting with Mock objects if these libraries are not available.\n- No data is processed from untrusted sources, no external communication, and no runtime data handling occurs.\n- The use of Mock objects is standard for optional dependencies, not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not execute any untrusted code, nor does it handle external inputs or outputs.\n- The Mock objects are used to prevent import errors when dependencies are missing, which is a common pattern.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The purpose is purely to define types, which does not involve any runtime security risk.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.1; this is reasonable because the code itself doesn't introduce security risks.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The use of Mock objects for optional dependencies might be questioned, but it is a standard practice and not malicious.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior that would warrant raising the malware or risk scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is straightforward, safe, and does not contain any malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\nThe code is a benign type alias definition module with conditional dependencies, handled safely and with standard practices.",
