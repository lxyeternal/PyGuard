{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for indexing and random number generator types used in other modules.",
  "sources": "Type hints for IndexType, IndicesType, RNGType; imports from standard library, third-party libraries, and optional imports based on availability.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is being read from untrusted sources or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Mock objects for optional dependencies; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code; imports are standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type aliases for better code clarity and compatibility. It conditionally imports numpy and torch if available, substituting mocks otherwise, which is standard practice for optional dependencies. The use of 'Mock' from unittest.mock is for testing or fallback scenarios and does not introduce malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are present. The code appears to be straightforward and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type definition module that includes standard conditional imports and type aliases. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
