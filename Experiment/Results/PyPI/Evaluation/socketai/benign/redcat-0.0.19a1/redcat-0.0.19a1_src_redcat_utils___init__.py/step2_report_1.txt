  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, considering the code content, the scoring, and the reasoning.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a single docstring or string literal stating \"Contain utility functions.\"\n   - There are no actual functions, executable statements, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is essentially a placeholder or documentation comment with no operational logic.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in identifying the code as non-executable and benign.\n   - They correctly note the absence of sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies.\n   - No logical errors are apparent since the code is just a string literal.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the absence of any suspicious activity.\n   - Confidence levels vary but are generally high (1 or 0.2), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across all, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is correct because there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - The highest confidence is 1 with zero risk, which is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware as 0, consistent with the code's benign description.\n   - No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is suggested.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all recognize the code as a placeholder or comment.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the content and analysis.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet is purely a descriptive string, with no executable or sensitive content.\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the minimal and benign nature of the code, I agree with the current assessments. There is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk in this fragment.",
