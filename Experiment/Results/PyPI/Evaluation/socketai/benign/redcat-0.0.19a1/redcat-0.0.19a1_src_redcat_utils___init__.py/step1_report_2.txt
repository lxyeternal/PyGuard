  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a single raw string with no functional code, no executable statements, or logic; no anomalies are detectable in this minimal fragment.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is only a string literal describing that the file contains utility functions. There is no actual implementation, data handling, or logic present. Without further code, no sources, sinks, or flows can be identified. The fragment does not contain any suspicious or malicious activity. Its simplicity and lack of executable content suggest it is a placeholder or comment docstring.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the minimal content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a docstring comment with no executable or sensitive components.",
