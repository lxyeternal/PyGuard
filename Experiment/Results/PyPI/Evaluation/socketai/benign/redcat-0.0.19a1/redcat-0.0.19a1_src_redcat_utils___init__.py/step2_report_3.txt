  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is only a raw string docstring indicating utility functions, with no executable code.\n   - **Errors/Flaws:** None. The reasoning correctly identifies the absence of code or malicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No code behavior or external interactions, so scores are justified.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; only a string literal with no code.\n   - **Errors/Flaws:** The confidence score is 0.2, which seems low given the minimal content. However, since the report emphasizes the lack of code, this is acceptable.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior detected.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same minimal content, only a docstring.\n   - **Errors/Flaws:** The confidence is 1, which is consistent with the lack of any code or suspicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** all zero, appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No risk or malware evident.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; only a descriptive string.\n   - **Errors/Flaws:** The confidence score is 1, which aligns with the minimal content.\n   - **Scores:** all zero, appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious activity.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same minimal content, only a string literal.\n   - **Errors/Flaws:** The confidence score is 1, consistent with the lack of code.\n   - **Scores:** all zero, appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is only a docstring without executable content.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** All scores are zero, which is justified.\n- **Security risk:** Zero across all reports, appropriate given the content.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The confidence scores vary but are generally acceptable. For such minimal content, high confidence (1) is justified.\n- The malware score is zero in all cases, correctly reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided content.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Estimated risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate given the input. No further action is necessary.",
