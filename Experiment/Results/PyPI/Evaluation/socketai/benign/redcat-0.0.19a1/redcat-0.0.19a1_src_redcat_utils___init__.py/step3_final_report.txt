  "analysis": "The code is solely a string literal with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder or documentation comment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The current assessments and scores are justified and accurate.",
