  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a single string literal (docstring) indicating \"utility functions.\"\n- There is no actual executable code, data flow, input/output, or external communication.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), except for report 2, which is lower (0.2).\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- Security risk scores are 0, suggesting no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is just a docstring with no executable logic or data handling. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None identified. The reports correctly identify that the snippet is a placeholder/documentation string with no malicious content.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the minimal content.\n  - SecurityRisk: 0, as no security issues are evident.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The **confidence scores** are mostly 1, which seems appropriate given the clear and minimal content.\n- The **malware scores** are correctly 0; no malicious activity is indicated.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are 0, which is reasonable.\n- The **securityRisk scores** are 0, matching the lack of any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Potential for change in scores:** Given the content, no changes are necessary. The assessments are consistent with the evidence.\n- **Justification for higher risk scores:** None are justified here; the code is benign.\n- **Claims based on assumptions:** No such claims are present; all analyses are based on observable facts.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports' findings and the code snippet's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify that this is a non-executable placeholder or documentation string with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening content. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The current assessments are accurate and justified.",
