{
  "purpose": "The code sets up configurations and fixtures for pytest testing framework, primarily related to matplotlib and async function checks.",
  "sources": "Import statements: inspect, os, matplotlib.pyplot, pytest; environment variable 'CIRQ_TESTING'; function parameters and local variables.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable setting 'CIRQ_TESTING'; raising ValueError for coroutine function detection.",
  "flows": "Imports and environment variable setting influence pytest configuration; inspection of functions influences exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code modifies environment variables and raises exceptions for async functions, which could affect test flows but not maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and third-party modules used in testing. The 'pytest_configure' function sets matplotlib backend and environment variable, which is standard for testing. The 'pytest_pyfunc_call' function inspects if a test function is a coroutine and raises an error if so, enforcing a coding standard. The 'closefigures' fixture ensures figures are closed after tests. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activities detected. It is typical test setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing setup for pytest, matplotlib, and async functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily enforces code standards and manages test environment configurations.",
