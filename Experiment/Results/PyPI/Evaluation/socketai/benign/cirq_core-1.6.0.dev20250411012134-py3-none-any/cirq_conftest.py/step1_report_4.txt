{
  "purpose": "The code configures pytest environment for testing, specifically setting the matplotlib backend and environment variable, and adds a fixture to close figures after tests.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ['CIRQ_TESTING']), inspecting function objects (inspect.iscoroutinefunction), importing modules (matplotlib.pyplot, os, inspect, pytest)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Environment variable setting affects global state during tests; inspecting coroutine functions influences test behavior but does not lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no backdoors or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up testing configurations: switching matplotlib backend to 'agg' to avoid display requirements, setting an environment variable for testing, and ensuring coroutines are properly decorated in pytest functions. It includes a fixture to close matplotlib figures after tests. No external data sources, sinks, or suspicious control flows are present. The code adheres to standard testing setup practices without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup script with no malicious or security-threatening components. It does not exhibit malware behavior, insecure data handling, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
