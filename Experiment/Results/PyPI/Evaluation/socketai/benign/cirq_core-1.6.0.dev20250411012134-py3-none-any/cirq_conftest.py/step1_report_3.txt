{
  "purpose": "The code sets up configuration and fixtures for pytest testing framework, primarily for managing matplotlib backend and async function validation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('CIRQ_TESTING'), inspects functions via 'inspect.iscoroutinefunction'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable setting influences matplotlib backend; function inspection for coroutine functions could be used to enforce coding standards but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears standard for testing environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports inspection, os, matplotlib, and pytest, then configures matplotlib to use a non-GUI backend and sets an environment variable. It includes a function to validate async functions and a fixture to close figures after tests. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network connections, or malicious logic. All code appears to be for test configuration purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard testing setup code with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is safe and has no security risks.",
