  "purpose": "Configure pytest environment, enforce coroutine decoration, and manage matplotlib figures during testing.",
  "sources": "Matplotlib backend switch, environment variable 'CIRQ_TESTING', inspection of test functions for coroutine decoration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; environment variable could influence subprocesses but is benign here.",
  "flows": "Environment variable setting influences test environment; function inspection enforces code standards without data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard testing setup with environment variable setting and function inspection.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a testing environment by switching matplotlib to a non-GUI backend, sets an environment variable 'CIRQ_TESTING', and enforces that coroutine test functions are decorated with '@duet.sync'. It also provides a fixture to close all matplotlib figures after tests. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The environment variable is typical for test configurations and does not pose security risks. The function that raises an error for un-decorated coroutine functions enforces code standards but is not malicious. The code relies solely on standard libraries and known testing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest setup script used for testing, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment variable and function enforcement are standard practices and do not introduce security risks.",
