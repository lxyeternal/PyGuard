{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for associating documentation with constants and private methods, primarily for documentation generation in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only processes in-memory data, such as assigning docstrings to constants and functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not send data to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "The flow involves associating documentation strings with values or objects within the program, with no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard documentation and utility functions with no suspicious or unusual code. Commented-out debugging lines and notes about limitations are present but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing functions to document constants and private functions for a larger documentation framework. It does not handle user input, network operations, or file I/O. No hardcoded secrets, malicious logic, or obfuscation is present. The commented notes indicate awareness of some limitations but do not introduce risk. Overall, the code appears to serve a benign purpose related to documentation generation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for associating documentation with constants and private methods. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It is part of a larger project and does not perform any dangerous operations.",
