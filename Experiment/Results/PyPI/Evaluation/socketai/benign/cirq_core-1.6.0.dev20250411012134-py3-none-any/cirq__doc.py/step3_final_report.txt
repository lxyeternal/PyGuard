  "purpose": "Utility functions for associating documentation strings with constants and private methods within the Cirq project, primarily for documentation generation.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures (RECORDED_CONST_DOCS), object attributes (__doc__), and class/function decorators.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; only internal attribute modifications and dictionary updates.",
  "flows": "The 'document' function stores documentation in a dictionary and attempts to set the __doc__ attribute; 'doc_private' sets a marker attribute for private methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; exception handling for read-only __doc__ attributes is standard practice; no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, manipulating internal data structures and object attributes for documentation purposes. It does not process external input, perform network or file I/O, or contain any malicious logic. The exception handling is benign, and the purpose is clearly for internal documentation support. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module used for documentation purposes within the Cirq project. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, consistent with the analysis.",
