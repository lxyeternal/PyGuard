{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for associating documentation strings with constants and private methods, specifically within the Cirq project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'value' parameter in the 'document' function, and the 'obj' parameter in the 'doc_private' decorator.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to the 'RECORDED_CONST_DOCS' dictionary and sets the '__doc__' attribute of objects; no untrusted sinks directly affect external systems or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The 'document' function maps 'id(value)' to 'doc_string', and optionally sets '__doc__' attribute of 'value'. The 'doc_private' decorator adds an attribute to 'obj'. No external or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code only manipulates internal data structures and attributes for documentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing utility functions for documentation handling. It includes a try-except block for safely setting '__doc__' attributes, which is standard. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The functions are purely for documentation support within the Cirq library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as documentation utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard internal helper module.",
