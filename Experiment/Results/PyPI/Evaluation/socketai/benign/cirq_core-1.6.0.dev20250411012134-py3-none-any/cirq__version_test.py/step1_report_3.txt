  "purpose": "The code is a simple test function that asserts the version of the cirq library.",
  "sources": "Reading the cirq module to get its __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads cirq.__version__ and asserts its value; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and does not contain suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the cirq library, then defines a test function that asserts the library's version matches a specific string. It does not process user input, network data, or perform any file operations. The code appears to be a simple unit test for the library version. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity is present. It is a standard test case with no side effects or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test function verifying the cirq library version. No malicious intent or security threats are identified.",
