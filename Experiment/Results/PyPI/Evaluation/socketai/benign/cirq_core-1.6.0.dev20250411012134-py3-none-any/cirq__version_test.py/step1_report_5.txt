{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a version check for the 'cirq' library, likely for testing or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'cirq' library's __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not send data externally or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The source is 'cirq.__version__'; the flow is used in an assertion for version validation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'cirq' library and defines a test function that asserts the library's version matches a specific string. No external data inputs, network communications, or suspicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version check for the 'cirq' library used likely in a testing context. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
