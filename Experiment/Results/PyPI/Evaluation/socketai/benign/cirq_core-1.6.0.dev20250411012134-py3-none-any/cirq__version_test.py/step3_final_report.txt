{
  "purpose": "To verify the installed version of the 'cirq' library matches a specific development version string, likely for testing or environment validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'cirq' module's '__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The source ('cirq.__version__') is compared directly in an assertion; no data flows beyond this check.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with a simple version assertion, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'cirq' and asserts its version equals a specific string. It contains no input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports agree that it is benign, performing a standard version check. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The hardcoded version string could cause test failures if the environment's 'cirq' version changes, but this is a normal testing practice, not a security concern. The overall assessment confirms the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version check with no malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
