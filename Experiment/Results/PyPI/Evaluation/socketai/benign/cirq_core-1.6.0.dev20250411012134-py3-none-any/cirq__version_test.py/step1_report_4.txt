{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple test function checking the version of the 'cirq' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'cirq' module to access its '__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could leak data or cause side effects are present.",
  "flows": "The source (cirq.__version__) is used within an assertion to verify the library version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'cirq' and defines a test function to assert its version matches a specific string. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity. The purpose appears to be a simple version check, likely part of a test suite. The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a simple version assertion for the 'cirq' library. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
