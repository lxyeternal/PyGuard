  "purpose": "Enforce minimum Python version requirement (>=3.10) and define version string.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for version check",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → comparison → exception raise",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version enforcement",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, checks if the current Python version is below 3.10, and raises a SystemError with an instructive message if so. It then defines a static version string. The logic is simple, standard, and does not involve dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The purpose is to enforce environment compatibility, which is a common and safe practice. The code is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment check enforcing Python version requirements. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
