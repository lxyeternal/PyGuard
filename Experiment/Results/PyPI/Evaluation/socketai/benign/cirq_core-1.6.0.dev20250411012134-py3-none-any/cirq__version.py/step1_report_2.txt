{
  "purpose": "The code enforces Python version requirements for the Cirq library and defines its version number.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from the sys module.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a SystemError if the Python version is below 3.10, which terminates execution.",
  "flows": "The sys.version_info check flows directly into a SystemError exception if the condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward version check and error message display.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, checks if the current Python version is less than 3.10, and raises an error to prevent incompatible usage. The version number is statically defined. No input/output, no data leakage, and no dynamic code execution are present. The behavior is typical for enforcing environment prerequisites. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version enforcement snippet for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
