  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the same core functionality: importing sys, checking sys.version_info, raising a SystemError if the Python version is below 3.10, and defining a version string.  \n- They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard for environment enforcement.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The logic is clear, and the implementation is standard.  \n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports suggest any malicious activity. The code does not perform network operations, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended, with no evident flaws or mistakes.  \n- **Potential improvements:** From a security perspective, the code could be enhanced by adding more detailed logging or allowing for more flexible version checks, but these are not security issues per se.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code enforces environment requirements without introducing risks.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5.  \n- The code's purpose is purely to enforce environment constraints, which is a common and safe practice.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent across all reports, all being 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, my assessment is:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple environment check and version declaration, with no malicious intent or security flaws. It is a standard practice in Python packages to enforce minimum Python versions, and the implementation here is clear and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to scores are necessary. The overall security posture of this code is very high, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
