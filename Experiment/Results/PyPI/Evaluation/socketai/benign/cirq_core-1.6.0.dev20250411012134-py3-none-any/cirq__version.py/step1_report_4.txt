  "sinks": "SystemError exception raised when version check fails",
  "flows": "sys.version_info read -> version check -> exception raised if condition met",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and exception handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, performs a version check for Python >= 3.10, and raises a SystemError if the condition is not met. The purpose is to prevent incompatible Python versions from running the package. The version check and exception handling are standard and do not perform any malicious activity. No input or untrusted data is used beyond system info, and the exception is a typical response. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version enforcement check with no malicious intent. It simply prevents running the package on unsupported Python versions.",
