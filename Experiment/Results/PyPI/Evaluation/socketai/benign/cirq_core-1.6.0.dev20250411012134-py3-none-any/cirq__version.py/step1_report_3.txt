  "purpose": "Enforce Python version compatibility for the cirq library and define its version number.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for checking Python version.",
  "sinks": "The SystemError exception raised if Python version is below 3.10, which terminates the program.",
  "flows": "The code reads the Python runtime version and, if incompatible, triggers a termination; no external data flow or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The version string appears to be a development identifier, but this is typical and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies the Python interpreter's version and halts execution if the version is below 3.10, providing a clear message. The version string is hardcoded, which is standard for versioning. No input/output, network, or external data handling is present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version check and version declaration, with no signs of malicious intent. It enforces compatibility requirements securely without introducing risks.",
