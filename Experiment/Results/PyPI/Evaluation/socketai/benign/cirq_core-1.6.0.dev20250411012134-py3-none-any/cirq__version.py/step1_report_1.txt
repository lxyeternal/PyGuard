  "purpose": "Define version number and enforce Python version requirement for the Cirq library.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info to check Python version.",
  "sinks": "Raise SystemError if Python version is below 3.10, terminating the program.",
  "flows": "Code reads system environment (Python version), then potentially terminates execution based on version check.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; straightforward version check and exception raising.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to access system information. It performs a version check on sys.version_info. If the Python version is below 3.10, it raises a SystemError with a message instructing the user to upgrade or install an older version of the package. Otherwise, it proceeds to define a version string. All actions are standard for version enforcement. No data leaks, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. The code simply enforces environment requirements without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version check and environment enforcement script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
