  "purpose": "Ensure that the Python environment meets the minimum version requirement for the cirq library and provide version information.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info used to check Python version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code raises an exception if the version check fails",
  "flows": "sys.version_info check flows to a SystemError exception if the condition is met",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a standard version check and raises an error with a descriptive message",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and checks the current Python version against (3, 10, 0). If the version is lower, it raises a SystemError with a clear message instructing the user to update Python or install an older cirq version. The version string is a standard string assignment. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or suspicious patterns are present. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward environment compatibility check and provides helpful instructions if requirements are not met. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
