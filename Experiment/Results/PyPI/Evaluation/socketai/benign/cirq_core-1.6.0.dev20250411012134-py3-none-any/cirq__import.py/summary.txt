  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, sophisticated utility for import management, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. While powerful and potentially misusable if misconfigured, it currently poses no security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential for misuse but no active malicious intent."
