  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script fetches release info from GitHub, downloads a binary, and extracts it during post-installation.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The process involves external network requests and filesystem operations typical for such setup scripts.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3 — moderate due to external download, but standard practice.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — high confidence that the code is benign.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dynamic download of platform-specific binaries from GitHub, no verification.\n- **Assessment:** The code performs expected tasks but lacks checksum verification, increasing supply chain risk.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity evident.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — higher due to no integrity checks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** The report correctly notes potential supply chain issues but no malicious intent. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Downloads and extracts binaries from GitHub during setup, no verification.\n- **Assessment:** The pattern is typical but risky without checksum validation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.2 — slight concern, but no evidence of malware.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard installer fetching binaries based on system info, no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** No obfuscation or malicious code; standard procedure.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Downloads binaries during install based on environment/system info, no verification, uses exit() calls.\n- **Assessment:** The use of exit() without error messaging is a concern for robustness but not malicious. External download without verification is a security concern.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — due to reliance on external sources without verification.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis aligns with the code. No malicious activity, but the risk is in the external dependency.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.2). The code does not exhibit malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.4, mainly due to external downloads without verification.\n\n### My Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious intent or activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.3** — moderate, primarily due to external dependencies and lack of verification, which could be exploited if the external source is compromised.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- The code's pattern of downloading binaries during setup is common but should ideally include checksum or signature verification to mitigate supply chain risks.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation is present.\n- The main concern is the external dependency and the lack of verification, not malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate and designed for platform-specific binary installation. The risk is manageable with proper verification measures, which are not currently implemented.",
