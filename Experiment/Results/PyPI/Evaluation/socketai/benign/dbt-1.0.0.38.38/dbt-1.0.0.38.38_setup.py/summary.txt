  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate installer component that dynamically fetches and installs platform-specific binaries. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The primary security risk stems from downloading binaries without verification, which could be exploited if the external source is compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate at 0.4. Implementing checksum or signature verification would mitigate this risk, but as it stands, the code is not malicious."
