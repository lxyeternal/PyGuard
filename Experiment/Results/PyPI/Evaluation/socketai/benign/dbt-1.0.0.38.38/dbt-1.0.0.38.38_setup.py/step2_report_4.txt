  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare it with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n**Purpose:** Fetches release info from GitHub, downloads, and extracts binaries during post-install.\n\n**Key points:**\n- No hardcoded credentials.\n- External network requests are standard.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- Main concern: downloading binaries dynamically during install, potential supply chain risk.\n\n**Analysis & Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — aligns with the review; no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.3 — reasonable, given the external download risk.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent and reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n**Purpose:** Similar to above; downloads binaries from GitHub during setup.\n\n**Key points:**\n- No validation or checksum verification.\n- External dependency without integrity checks.\n- Potential for malicious binaries if GitHub repo is compromised.\n\n**Analysis & Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — matches the code; no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.4 — appropriate; external download without verification is a security concern.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n**Purpose:** Downloads a tarball of CLI tool from GitHub during package setup.\n\n**Key points:**\n- No suspicious obfuscation.\n- External download during install, no verification.\n- Standard logic, potential supply chain risk.\n\n**Analysis & Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.2 — this is slightly higher than previous, perhaps due to the download-extract pattern. But the code itself isn't malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.4 — aligns with the concern about external downloads without verification.\n\n**Justification for malware score:** The code does download and execute external binaries, which could be malicious if the source is compromised. The score reflects the potential risk, not actual malware presence.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n**Purpose:** Downloads platform-specific binaries from GitHub during installation.\n\n**Key points:**\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Standard fetching and extraction.\n- No obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n**Analysis & Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, as the code performs standard operations.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n**Purpose:** Downloads binaries based on environment variables and system info, during post-install.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Uses exit() without messaging, which is a minor concern.\n- No evidence of malicious code.\n- External download and extraction, similar to others.\n\n**Analysis & Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code isn't malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.4 — consistent with other reports; external binary fetch without verification.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no actual malicious code, only external downloads. The malware scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.2, which is acceptable given the context.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.4, reflecting the potential supply chain risks inherent in downloading binaries during setup without verification.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.3 — considering the external dependency and lack of verification, this is a moderate risk but not malicious.\n\n**Final note:** The main security concern is the reliance on external binaries without checksum or signature verification, which could be exploited if the source is compromised. Implementing integrity checks would mitigate this risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No significant adjustments are necessary.",
