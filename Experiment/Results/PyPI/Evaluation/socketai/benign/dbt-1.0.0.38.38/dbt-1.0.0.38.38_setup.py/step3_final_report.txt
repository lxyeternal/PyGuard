{
  "purpose": "Fetches release information from GitHub, downloads platform-specific binaries, and extracts them during post-installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for version info, system and architecture info for binary selection, external network requests to GitHub API and binary URLs.",
  "sinks": "Downloading binaries from external sources, writing temporary files, extracting tarballs into installation directory.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> get_release_list() -> lookup_asset_url() -> download_binary() -> write to temp file -> extract into install directory.",
  "anomalies": "Uses exit() calls without error messages, no checksum or signature verification for downloaded binaries, reliance on external sources without verification.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard platform detection, fetches release info from GitHub, downloads binaries, and extracts them. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. External network requests are typical but pose supply chain risks due to lack of verification. The use of exit() without messaging reduces robustness but is not malicious. Overall, the logic is straightforward and aligns with typical setup scripts, with the main security concern being the potential for compromised binaries due to missing integrity checks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate installer component that dynamically fetches and installs platform-specific binaries. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The primary security risk stems from downloading binaries without verification, which could be exploited if the external source is compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate at 0.4. Implementing checksum or signature verification would mitigate this risk, but as it stands, the code is not malicious.",
