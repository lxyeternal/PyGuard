  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code, then synthesize an overall security stance.\n\n**General observations from the code:**\n- The script dynamically fetches release info from GitHub based on environment variables and system info.\n- It downloads platform-specific binaries and extracts them into the install directory during post-install.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- The process involves external network requests and filesystem modifications during installation.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration in the script itself.\n- However, reliance on external binaries and lack of integrity verification pose supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Fetches latest release, downloads, and extracts.\n- **Assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with standard network and file operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.3\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. The low malware score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Downloads binaries from GitHub releases based on system info.\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, highlights potential supply chain risk due to external download without verification.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.4\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No malicious activity detected, but external dependency is noted.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Downloads a tarball of CLI tool from GitHub.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, but external code execution during install is a security concern.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 (slightly higher, considering potential risk)\n- **Security risk:** 0.4\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Verdict:** Slightly elevated malware score is reasonable given the external code fetch during install.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard installer fetching platform-specific binaries.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, straightforward process.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The minimal risk aligns with the straightforward logic.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to others, downloading binaries during post-install.\n- **Assessment:** No overt malicious activity, but external dependencies and lack of verification are noted.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.4\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.2), which is appropriate given the code. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree it's not obfuscated.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations, but generally around 0.3-0.4, reflecting the inherent risk of downloading external binaries during install without verification.\n\n**Critical considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The main security concern is the supply chain risk due to external binaries fetched during install, especially without checksum verification.\n- No evidence of malware, code injection, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (consistent with all reports and code analysis)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (moderate, due to external dependency and lack of verification)\n\n**Note:** The risk score could be slightly higher if the external source is compromised, but based on the code and reports, it remains moderate.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.3** |\n\nThis reflects that the code is not malicious but has inherent supply chain risks due to external binary downloads without verification. The assessments in the reports are reasonable and align with this conclusion.",
