  "purpose": "Implementation of the Hungarian (Kuhn-Munkres) algorithm to solve the Assignment Problem, including utility functions for matrix manipulation and testing.",
  "sources": "Input matrices for the compute method, configuration parameters in pad_matrix, make_cost_matrix, and print_matrix functions.",
  "sinks": "Results of compute method (assignment pairs), print output in print_matrix, and data derived during matrix processing.",
  "flows": "Input matrices are processed in make_cost_matrix and compute; data flows through the algorithm steps in the Munkres class methods; results flow back to the caller via compute output and print functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or stealth behaviors detected. Use of sys.maxsize as a minimal value for computations is standard. The code operates solely on input matrices and internal data.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of the Munkres algorithm with utility functions. It handles square and rectangular matrices, supports disallowed values, and includes test cases in the main block. The functions and class methods perform typical matrix operations, such as padding, marking, and path construction. There are no signs of malicious payloads, such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The code appears to be a legitimate algorithm implementation with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of the Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage mechanisms. It appears to be safe, well-structured, and intended for mathematical computation, with no hidden malicious intent.",
