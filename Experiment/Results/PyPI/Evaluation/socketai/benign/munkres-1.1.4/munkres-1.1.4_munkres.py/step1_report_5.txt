{
  "purpose": "Implement the Munkres (Hungarian) algorithm to solve assignment problems, with utility functions for matrix manipulation and cost matrix creation.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via function parameters, especially in 'compute' and 'make_cost_matrix'; the script also reads matrices from predefined variables in the main block.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks that transmit data externally; no network, file, or environment variable operations that send data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input matrices into computation methods, such as 'compute', through matrix padding and manipulation, with no external data transmission or unsafe handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors present. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-known algorithm with proper handling for square and rectangular matrices, including padding and disallowed value handling. It uses standard Python constructs, deep copying for matrices, and no malicious external calls or hidden behaviors. The main block demonstrates usage with predefined test matrices, with no user input or network operations. All functions perform legitimate algorithmic tasks related to solving assignment problems, with appropriate exception handling for unsolvable matrices. No suspicious code segments, obfuscated code, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This Python module appears to be a legitimate implementation of the Munkres algorithm for assignment problems. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The code is clean, standard, and does not perform any external network or system modifications beyond computation. The presence of test cases and utility functions supports its role as a computational library rather than malware.",
