{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the Hungarian (Munkres) algorithm for solving assignment problems, including utility functions for matrix manipulation and testing.",
  "sources": "Input matrices provided to the compute() method, and during testing in the main block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external network or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Input matrices are processed through padding, row reduction, and marking steps to find minimal assignment; no external data flows or leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, textbook implementation of the Hungarian algorithm with clear structure, utility functions, and test cases. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. It operates solely on input matrices, with no external network calls or data leaks. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated as 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to benign test code and internal processing. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of the Hungarian algorithm, free of malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is negligible, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
