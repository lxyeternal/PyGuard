  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the implementation of the Hungarian algorithm, with utility functions and test matrices.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no external network calls, no obfuscation. The code is a standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded; the code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; standard implementation.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no external dependencies or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a legitimate implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; testing with predefined matrices.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity; only printing during tests.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appears safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, risk=0.0 — the securityRisk is minimal, possibly due to the print statements, but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard implementation, no external data sources.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no external network or data leaks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, risk=0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others; no external data transmission.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no malicious code, no network calls.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appears safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, risk=0.0 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's content.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.0 or 0.1), mainly due to benign print statements or minor concerns about code exposure during testing, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-documented implementation of the Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The utility functions and main tests are standard and do not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — safe for supply chain; minor concerns about test code exposure but no real risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscating elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable.",
