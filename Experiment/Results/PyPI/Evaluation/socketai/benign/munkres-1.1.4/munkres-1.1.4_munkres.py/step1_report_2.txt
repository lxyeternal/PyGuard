  "purpose": "Implementation of the Munkres (Hungarian) algorithm for solving the assignment problem, including utilities for creating cost matrices and printing matrices.",
  "sources": "Input data for the compute() method (cost matrix), environment variables (via sys), user input (if any via print statements).",
  "sinks": "No evident data leaks or untrusted data processing; no direct network or file operations; no apparent sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input cost matrix → processing within compute() and pad_matrix() → output as assigned pairs; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries only. The main code is structured and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a well-known algorithm (Hungarian) for assignment problems. It includes functions for matrix padding, conversion from profit to cost matrices, and printing matrices. No external network connections, file operations, or environment manipulations are present. The code does not generate or handle any secret data, nor does it execute any untrusted code or code injection. The only external inputs are matrices provided within the script or via user-provided data when calling compute(). The logic appears consistent with standard implementations. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of the Munkres algorithm for assignment problems. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code, nor does it exhibit obfuscation or malware traits. No security risks or malicious behaviors are identified based on the provided code.",
