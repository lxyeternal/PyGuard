  "purpose": "Implementation of the Munkres (Hungarian) algorithm for solving assignment problems, including utility functions for creating cost matrices and printing matrices.",
  "sources": "Reading input matrices, especially in the main block where predefined test matrices are used.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The main computation flows from input matrices to the `compute()` method, which processes the data internally without external influence. Utility functions process data but do not lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or hardcoded credentials. The code is well-structured, and no dynamic code execution or suspicious imports are present. The `__main__` block only runs predefined tests; no user input or external data sources are involved.",
  "analysis": "The code implements the classical Hungarian algorithm with standard methods for matrix padding, solving, and displaying results. No signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All modules and functions perform their stated purpose without hidden or malicious intent. The only external interaction is printing to stdout during testing, which is benign. There are no embedded or obfuscated parts, and the logic appears transparent and typical for an algorithm implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This Python package appears to be a legitimate implementation of the Munkres algorithm for solving assignment problems. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within the provided code. The code is well-documented, standard, and safe for use.",
