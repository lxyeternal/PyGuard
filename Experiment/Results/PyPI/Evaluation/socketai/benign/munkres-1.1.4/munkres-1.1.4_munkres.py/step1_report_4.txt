{
  "purpose": "Implementation of the Hungarian (Munkres) algorithm for solving assignment problems, including utility functions for matrix manipulation and cost matrix creation.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from provided matrices in the main test block, user-supplied matrices for computation; no external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output beyond printing matrices and results; no untrusted data flow to network, files, or sensitive environments.",
  "flows": "Input matrices are processed through the compute() method, which performs the assignment calculation; no external or untrusted data flows beyond in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code uses standard library functions and straightforward algorithms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of the Munkres algorithm, including functions for matrix padding, cost matrix creation, and the stepwise solution process. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious logic detected. The main block runs predefined matrices for testing, with no user input or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system harm. External library usage is standard, and no insecure practices are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate implementation of the Munkres algorithm for solving assignment problems. It performs standard matrix operations, contains no malicious or suspicious code, and appears safe for use. There are no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
