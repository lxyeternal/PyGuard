  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'munkres' Python package, including build, documentation, and testing commands.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (COLUMNS, PYTHONPATH), importing 'munkres.py' file from disk, and invoking external commands (pdoc, pytest).",
  "sinks": "Executing system commands ('os.system' for pdoc), setting environment variables ('PYTHONPATH'), and running pytest for tests.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (COLUMNS, PYTHONPATH) -> system commands ('pdoc', 'pytest') -> subprocess execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader' to dynamically load 'munkres.py' instead of a standard import; no apparent malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. External commands are used for documentation and testing but are typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment checks for Python version compatibility and dynamically loads the 'munkres.py' module from the current directory. It defines command classes for generating API documentation and running tests via 'pdoc' and 'pytest', respectively. These commands set environment variables and invoke external tools through 'os.system' or module imports, which is standard for such build scripts. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code uses standard practices for package setup and documentation/testing commands, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package, with safe dynamic module loading and standard external command execution. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate build and testing script for the 'munkres' package.",
