  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'munkres' Python package, handling environment checks, dynamic import of local module, and defining commands for documentation and testing.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing 'munkres.py' via importlib, executing external commands ('pdoc', 'pytest') with os.system",
  "sinks": "External commands ('pdoc', 'pytest') executed via os.system, potentially affecting system state or output",
  "flows": "Environment variables and module attributes are used to configure commands; commands are run via os.system with fixed strings, no untrusted input involved",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard setup practices observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment validation, dynamically loads a local module, and runs external commands for documentation and testing. All external commands are constructed with fixed strings, with no user input influencing execution. No obfuscation or malicious activity is present. The dynamic import is controlled, and the external commands are typical for build scripts. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the use of os.system(), but since no untrusted input is involved, the risk remains low. The malware score is zero, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is zero, given the straightforward code structure. Confidence in this assessment is high, around 0.9-1.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup utility for a Python package. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. External command execution is controlled and typical for such scripts. The overall security posture is very low risk, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
