  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code dynamically loads 'munkres.py' from the local filesystem using importlib machinery, which is standard for plugin-like behavior.\n- It performs environment checks for Python version compatibility.\n- It defines custom commands for documentation ('pdoc') and testing ('pytest'), which invoke external commands via os.system.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- External commands are constructed with fixed strings, not influenced by user input, minimizing injection risk.\n- The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup script with no malicious intent. The dynamic import is controlled, and external command execution is typical. The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the minimal external command execution and no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report provides a thorough, confident analysis. The use of importlib and external commands are standard, and no malicious activity is suspected. The security risk score of 0 aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis is consistent. The script's behavior is typical, with no signs of malicious activity. The slightly higher security risk score (0.1) reflects cautious acknowledgment of external command execution, but it's justified given the controlled environment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2  \n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly notes that external command execution via os.system is controlled and not influenced by untrusted input. The overall conclusion that the script is benign is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with previous findings. The use of fixed command strings and controlled environment reduces risk. The security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflects the external command execution, but none of these are inherently dangerous given the context.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to external command execution, but well-contained.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, legitimate setup script for a Python package. No signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is very low, primarily due to external command execution, which is controlled and standard for such scripts.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
