  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script performs environment checks, dynamically loads 'munkres.py' via importlib, and executes external commands for documentation and testing. It notes no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Justification:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate. The malware score of 0 is justified; no malware is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices. It notes dynamic import and external command execution, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Justification:** No issues found; the scores are reasonable. The security risk is minimal, and malware is zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard setup script. It highlights the dynamic import, use of external commands, and no signs of malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n- **Justification:** Appropriate, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusions. The report emphasizes the controlled use of environment variables and external commands, with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to the use of os.system(), but since no untrusted input is involved, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also notes the standard practices, controlled use of os.system(), and no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n- **Justification:** Similar reasoning; the external command execution is controlled, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code analysis—no malicious code, backdoors, or payloads are detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code structure.\n\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), justified by the use of 'os.system()' calls. Since these calls do not process untrusted input, the risk remains low.\n\n- **Confidence Levels:** High (mostly 1), justified by thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Systematic Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. The dynamic import, environment variable usage, and external command execution are typical for setup scripts and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the controlled use of external commands and no evidence of malicious activity, I would assign:\n\n  - **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n  - **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to 'os.system()' usage, but no untrusted input involved)\n\n- **Overall Confidence:** High (around 0.9–1), as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|-----------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| **0**           | **0**              | **0.1**      | No malicious code, obfuscation, or significant security risks detected. External commands are controlled and standard for such scripts. |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the evidence provided.",
