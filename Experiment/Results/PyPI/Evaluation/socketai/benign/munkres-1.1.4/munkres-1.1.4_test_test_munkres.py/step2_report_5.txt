  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details of the code and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- It is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the `munkres` library, covering various matrix sizes, data types (integer and float), special cases like disallowed entries, irregular shapes, and profit-based transformations.\n- All matrices are hardcoded within test functions.\n- Usage of `DISALLOWED` constants from the library to represent invalid entries.\n- Handling of float precision with `pytest.approx` and comments about setting the \"places\" argument.\n- No external input, network, file, or system command operations.\n- Tests include expected exceptions (`UnsolvableMatrix`).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of malicious code?** No. All code appears to be standard test cases.\n- **External data sources?** No, all matrices are hardcoded.\n- **Potential sinks or data leaks?** No. No network, file, or system commands.\n- **Obfuscation or backdoors?** No. The code is straightforward, with clear test purposes.\n- **Use of `DISALLOWED`?** Standard within the library; not suspicious.\n- **Use of `sys.maxsize`?** Normal for converting maximization problems into minimization.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Scores assigned in reports:**\n  - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0.\n  - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.95 or 1), indicating trust in the benign nature.\n  - The comments and explanations are consistent with standard testing practices.\n\n- **Any questionable claims?**  \n  No. All claims are consistent with the code's purpose: testing the `munkres` library.\n\n- **Potential issues?**  \n  The only notable comment is in `test_20_x_20_float`, mentioning the \"places\" argument for floating-point precision, which is a normal concern when dealing with floating-point comparisons.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious code, no dynamic execution, no external data.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, **the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable**.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is transparent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.0 — no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports correctly identify this code as a benign, well-structured test suite for the `munkres` library. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present. The scoring aligns with the actual code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that the test code is maintained and that no external or untrusted inputs are introduced in future modifications. But as it stands, this code is safe.",
