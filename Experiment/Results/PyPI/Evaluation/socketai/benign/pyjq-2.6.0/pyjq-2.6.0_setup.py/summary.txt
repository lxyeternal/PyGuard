  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build automation script for dependencies with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.1–0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary; the supply chain security posture is benign."
