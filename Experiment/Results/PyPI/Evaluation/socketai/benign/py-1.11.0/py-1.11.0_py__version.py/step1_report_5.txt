{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string assignment, comments indicating generated code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input, no data leaks, no sensitive information handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Comments explicitly state the file is auto-generated and should not be modified, which is typical for version control metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns version information to variables and contains comments about its origin. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. It appears to be a standard, auto-generated version descriptor. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic is present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for build metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package version metadata without any malicious intent or security risks.",
