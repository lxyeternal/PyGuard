  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated snippet assigning static version variables.\n   - No input handling, no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation are present.\n   - The code contains only comments and simple variable assignments.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; the code is minimal and benign.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n   - The code is typical for package metadata and generated by a known tool (`setuptools_scm`).\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence score is 1 across all reports, justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions:**\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the analysis correctly states the code's benign nature.\n   - No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is inferred or implied.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a simple, auto-generated version declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The malware score remains at 0.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0.\n- The overall security risk is 0.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code. No further action or concern is warranted.",
