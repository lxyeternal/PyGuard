  "purpose": "This code defines static version information variables generated by setuptools_scm, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only assigns static string and tuple values.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process or output data beyond variable assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static with direct variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; comments indicate auto-generation, but do not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, auto-generated version declaration with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external interactions. It contains only static variable assignments for version info, with comments clarifying its origin. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code's simplicity and transparency confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata snippet with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, aligning with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
