  "purpose": "Generate an HTML document with custom styles using a subclassed py.xml.html structure",
  "sources": "Importing the 'py' library and accessing 'py.xml.html' for HTML element creation",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A; code constructs HTML elements from static definitions without untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'py.xml.html' to define subclasses and override styles; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'py' library and creates subclasses of HTML elements to define custom styles. It constructs an HTML document with styled headers and paragraphs. The code appears to be purely static, defining and printing an HTML structure. No external inputs, data leakage, or malicious behaviors such as network activity or data theft are present. The pattern follows standard subclassing for styling purposes and does not involve any suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward static HTML generator with custom styles. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate, with no anomalies or obfuscated patterns.",
