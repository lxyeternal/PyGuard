  "purpose": "Static HTML generation with custom styles using py.xml.html classes.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or network activity; static class definitions and object instantiations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, external data flow, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of py.xml.html elements, adding style attributes, and constructs a static HTML document. It performs no dynamic operations, external data handling, or network activity. The code is straightforward, with clear class inheritance and styling, and produces a static HTML output. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static HTML generator with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
