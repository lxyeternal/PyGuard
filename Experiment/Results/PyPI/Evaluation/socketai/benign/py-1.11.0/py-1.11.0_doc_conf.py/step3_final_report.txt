{
  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation, primarily setting options and importing modules for versioning.",
  "sources": "Import of 'py' module to retrieve version info",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or code execution points",
  "flows": "Import of 'py' occurs at startup to get version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard configuration with a typical import for version info",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It imports 'sys', 'os', and 'py' modules, with 'py' used solely to access version info. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no obfuscation or secrets. The import of 'py' is common in projects for versioning and does not indicate malicious intent unless the package is compromised. Overall, the code is benign and poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
