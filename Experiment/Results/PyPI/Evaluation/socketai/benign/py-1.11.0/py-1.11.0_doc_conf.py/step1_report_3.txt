  "purpose": "Configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation, defining project settings and output options.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, os, and py modules; reads configuration parameters and project metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no external network connections, data leaks, or code execution points found.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from sources to sinks; configuration data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to be standard documentation configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script setting parameters for documentation output formats, themes, and project info. The only import that could be dynamic is the 'py' module, used for version info; however, it is assumed to be a normal package. There are no network operations, data collection, or execution of untrusted code. The structure and content align with standard setup for documentation generation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely manages documentation settings without any indicators of malware or security threats.",
