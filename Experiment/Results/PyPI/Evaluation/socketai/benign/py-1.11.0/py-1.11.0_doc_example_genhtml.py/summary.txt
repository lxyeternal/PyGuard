  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static HTML generator with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only technical note is the use of unicode(), which affects compatibility but not security. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation at 0, and risk at 0 or 0.1 to reflect minimal compatibility concerns. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious."
