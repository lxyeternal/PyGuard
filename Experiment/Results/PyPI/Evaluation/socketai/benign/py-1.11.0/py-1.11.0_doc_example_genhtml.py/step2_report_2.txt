  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code generates static HTML with no external input or malicious behavior. Use of 'unicode()' suggests Python 2.x.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high certainty.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on static data and deprecated 'unicode()' usage.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low; perhaps considering the deprecated function as a minor concern.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same overall conclusion: static HTML generation, no external input, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar findings; no malicious activity, straightforward static HTML.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (again, minor concern over 'unicode()' in Python 3).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion; static content, no external data, no malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n- The only technical concern is the use of 'unicode()', which suggests Python 2.x compatibility issues, not malicious intent.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, external data handling, or malware.\n\n### Adjustments to Scores:\n- **Malware:** All should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all, consistent with the reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, risks should be minimal. The reports' assigned 0 or 0.1 seem appropriate, but perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to deprecated function usage, not an actual vulnerability)\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is static and benign.\n- The main technical note is the use of 'unicode()' which could cause issues in Python 3, but this isn't a security concern.\n- No evidence of code injection, data leaks, or malicious payloads.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor risk score reflects potential compatibility issues rather than security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to deprecated Python 2 code, not a security vulnerability)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across the reports.",
