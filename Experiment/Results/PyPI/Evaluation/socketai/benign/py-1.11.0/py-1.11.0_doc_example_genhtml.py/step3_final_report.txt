  "purpose": "Generate static HTML with meta and paragraph tags using py.xml.",
  "sources": "Static tuple 'paras' defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "Output via print statement after encoding.",
  "flows": "Static data flows into html.p elements, then into html.html, and finally printed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of unicode() function indicating Python 2.x compatibility; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a simple static HTML document with a meta tag and two paragraphs from a predefined tuple. It uses py.xml's html module to generate the HTML structure. The use of unicode() suggests Python 2.x, which may cause issues in Python 3 but is not malicious. No external data, network activity, or code injection is present. The output is static and straightforward. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minor concern about Python 2 compatibility does not constitute a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static HTML generator with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only technical note is the use of unicode(), which affects compatibility but not security. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation at 0, and risk at 0 or 0.1 to reflect minimal compatibility concerns. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
