  "purpose": "Package initialization and namespace setup for the 'pylib' utility library, enabling lazy-loading of submodules and backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'py._error', conditional import of 'apipkg' or fallback, import of version info, static string references in 'apipkg.initpkg' configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no external inputs, no network activity, no code execution beyond static imports.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Conditional import logic -> 'apipkg.initpkg' namespace configuration with static string references.",
  "anomalies": "None; static, well-structured code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static package setup script that uses conditional imports to load 'apipkg', sets up namespace mappings with static string references, and includes no dynamic code execution or external data handling. The use of 'apipkg' for lazy-loading is standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely configuration and namespace management, with no external data sources or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe package initialization script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, controlled nature.",
