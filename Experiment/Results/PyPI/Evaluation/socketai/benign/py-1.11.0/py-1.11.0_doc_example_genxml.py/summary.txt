  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of static XML generation using the 'py' library. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (e.g., 0.05 to 0.1) to reflect the minimal concern due to external library use. Overall, the reports are accurate, and the code is safe."
