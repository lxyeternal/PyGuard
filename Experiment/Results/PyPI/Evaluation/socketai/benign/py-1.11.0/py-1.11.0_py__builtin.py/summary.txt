  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility employing dynamic code execution functions appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The risk primarily stems from the inherent dangers of executing untrusted code, but in this context, it is used responsibly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.4), which is justified given the functionality."
