  "purpose": "Compatibility functions supporting Python 2 and 3, including dynamic code execution and module import management.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, open files (execfile), __import__, code objects, functions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "exec_, exec2, execfile, __import__, _reraise, reading source files.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (files, code objects) are executed via exec functions, imported modules are dynamically loaded, exceptions are re-raised with tracebacks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec and dynamic code execution functions, but justified for compatibility; no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility support across Python versions using dynamic execution functions and module imports. No malicious intent or backdoors are evident. The use of exec functions is standard for such utilities but inherently risky if untrusted input is used. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and lacks obfuscation. The dynamic execution is controlled and typical for compatibility layers, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility employing dynamic code execution functions appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The risk primarily stems from the inherent dangers of executing untrusted code, but in this context, it is used responsibly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.4), which is justified given the functionality.",
