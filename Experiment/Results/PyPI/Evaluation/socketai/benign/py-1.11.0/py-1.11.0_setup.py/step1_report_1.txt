  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file for a Python package, using setuptools. It reads a README file and defines package metadata and configuration, all of which are static values. No external input handling, dynamic code execution, or network communication is present. The code adheres to typical packaging conventions and contains no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical and safe for package distribution.",
