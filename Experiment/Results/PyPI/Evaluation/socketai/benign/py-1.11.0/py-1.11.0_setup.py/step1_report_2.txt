{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup for a Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description, package metadata fields (name, description, url, author, etc.), and package inclusion via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The setup function collects static configuration data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It imports 'setuptools', defines a main() function that calls setup() with package metadata and configuration, and executes main() if run as a script. It reads a README file for description and specifies package data and compatibility. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or other suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
