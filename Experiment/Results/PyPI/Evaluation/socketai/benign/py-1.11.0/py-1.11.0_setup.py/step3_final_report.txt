  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, defining metadata and configuration without dynamic or external input.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long_description; static package metadata and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file reading and hardcoded parameters into setup configuration; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open('README.rst').read() without exception handling; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script utilizing setuptools for packaging. It reads a README file without exception handling, which is common but could be improved. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input processing is present. The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All signals point to a benign, standard packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup.py script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should be 0, consistent with the analysis.",
