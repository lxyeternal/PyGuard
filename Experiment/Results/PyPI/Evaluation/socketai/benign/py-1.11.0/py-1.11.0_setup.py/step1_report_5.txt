  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'py', including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data flows or outputs.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' and passing static arguments to setup(); no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read a file without any exception handling; standard setup script without suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python library. It reads a README file for the long description, defines package metadata, and specifies package data. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
