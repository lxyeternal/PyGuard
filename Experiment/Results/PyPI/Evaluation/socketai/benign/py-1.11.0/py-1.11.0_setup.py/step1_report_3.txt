{
  "purpose": "The script defines setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata and package data, to facilitate package distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'README.rst' file for the long description, and uses the 'setuptools' library functions to gather package data.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code primarily handles package setup data and file reading.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading a file ('README.rst') to provide long_description, then passing parameters to 'setup()' for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open('README.rst').read()' without exception handling could be risky if the file is missing, but this is standard for setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, using standard 'setuptools' practices. It dynamically reads the long description from a README file, configures versioning with 'setuptools_scm', and specifies package metadata and data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or supply chain attacks. No network activity, credential handling, or dangerous operations are involved. The code structure and functionality are consistent with normal package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
