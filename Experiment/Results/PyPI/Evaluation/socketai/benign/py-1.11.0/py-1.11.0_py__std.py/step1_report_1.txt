  "purpose": "Provide a wrapper class that makes standard Python modules accessible as attributes, issuing deprecation warnings when accessed.",
  "sources": "The code reads from 'sys.modules' and dynamically imports modules using '__import__' when an attribute is accessed.",
  "sinks": "The '__import__' function loads modules based on attribute names; warnings are issued but not affecting control flow or data integrity.",
  "flows": "Accessing an attribute triggers '__getattr__', which imports the module named after the attribute, with a warning issued each time.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic importing via '__import__' based on attribute name could potentially be exploited if attribute names are controlled or manipulated, but in this context, it is a controlled pattern. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a warning class and a 'Std' class that exposes all modules in 'sys.modules' as attributes. Accessing any attribute triggers a deprecation warning and attempts to import the module if not already loaded. The import process uses '__import__' with the attribute name, which is a standard dynamic import pattern. The warnings notify users about deprecation, but do not execute malicious code or leak data. The code appears to be a utility for backward compatibility or transitional purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled utility that provides deprecated access to standard modules via dynamic import with warnings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign code snippet intended for deprecation handling.",
