  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper to access top-level Python modules as attributes, with lazy importing and a warning about deprecation.",
  "sources": "sys.modules (reads module registry), attribute access to dynamically import modules",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or output, no external data sinks",
  "flows": "Attribute access (e.g., std.os) triggers __getattr__, which imports the module if not present",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic importing with __import__ inside __getattr__, which can be misused if combined with untrusted attribute names; however, in this context, it appears for lazy import warnings, not malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a warning class and a wrapper class that exposes modules via __dict__, triggering lazy import and issuing warnings on deprecated usage. The __getattr__ method imports modules dynamically based on attribute access, which is standard Python behavior for lazy loading. No hardcoded secrets, no network access, no suspicious code. The warning about deprecation indicates an intended transition, not malicious activity. The code is simple, uses standard Python features, and doesn't perform any data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a deprecated wrapper for Python modules with lazy import and warning notifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks; it appears to be a benign utility for backward compatibility.",
