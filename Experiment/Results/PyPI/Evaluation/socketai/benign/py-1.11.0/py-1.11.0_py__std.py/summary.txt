  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a transitional utility with no malicious activity. The primary security consideration is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if attribute names are manipulated externally. Overall, the code is safe when used in trusted contexts, with a low but non-zero security risk."
