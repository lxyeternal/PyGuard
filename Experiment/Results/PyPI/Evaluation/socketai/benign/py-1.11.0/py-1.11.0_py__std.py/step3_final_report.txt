{
  "purpose": "Provides a deprecated wrapper class 'Std' that exposes Python's standard modules as attributes, issuing warnings on access and importing modules dynamically.",
  "sources": "Access to attribute names triggers __getattr__, which uses __import__ to load modules based on attribute name.",
  "sinks": "Potential if attribute names are influenced by untrusted input, leading to arbitrary module import.",
  "flows": "Attribute access -> __getattr__ -> __import__ of module named by attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on attribute name; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled utility for deprecated module access, with dynamic import via attribute name. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected. The main concern is potential misuse if attribute names are externally influenced, which could lead to importing malicious modules. Scores across reports are consistent, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a moderate security risk (~0.2) reflecting this potential misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a transitional utility with no malicious activity. The primary security consideration is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if attribute names are manipulated externally. Overall, the code is safe when used in trusted contexts, with a low but non-zero security risk.",
