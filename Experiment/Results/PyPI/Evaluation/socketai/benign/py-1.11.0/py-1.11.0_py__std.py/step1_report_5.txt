{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper class to access standard Python modules via attribute access, issuing a deprecation warning.",
  "sources": "sys.modules (built-in modules), attribute access to retrieve modules dynamically",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is written to external systems or network, and no untrusted input is processed in a harmful manner",
  "flows": "Attribute access on the 'std' object triggers __getattr__, which imports modules dynamically via __import__",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic import with exception handling; issues deprecation warnings but no malicious code or backdoors are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a deprecation warning class and a wrapper class 'Std' that exposes Python modules as attributes. When an attribute is accessed, it warns the user that 'py.std' is deprecated, then attempts to import the module dynamically. If the module cannot be imported, it raises an AttributeError. This approach allows for flexible module access but relies on dynamic imports, which could be misused if manipulated, though there is no evidence of malicious intent here. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, and no code obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple deprecation wrapper for Python modules with no malicious behavior. It facilitates access to modules via attribute access, warns users about deprecation, but does not contain malware or security risks.",
