The scores should be set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (e.g., 0.05 to 0.1) to reflect the minimal concern due to external library use. Overall, the reports are accurate, and the code is safe."

The only technical note is the use of unicode(), which affects compatibility but not security. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation at 0, and risk at 0 or 0.1 to reflect minimal compatibility concerns. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility employing dynamic code execution functions appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The risk primarily stems from the inherent dangers of executing untrusted code, but in this context, it is used responsibly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.4), which is justified given the functionality."

The primary security consideration is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if attribute names are manipulated externally. Overall, the code is safe when used in trusted contexts, with a low but non-zero security risk."
