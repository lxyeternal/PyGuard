  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code, a custom sleep function that actively polls the current time and repeatedly calls `__time.sleep()` to handle signals more reliably.\n- The code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and aims to improve signal handling during sleep.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors, external data handling, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or contain backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any actual security vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation.\n- The approach of busy-waiting and repeatedly calling sleep is unconventional but benign and intended for signal robustness.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The implementation may lead to slightly longer sleep durations if signals interrupt `__time.sleep()`, but this is a known trade-off and not a flaw per se.\n- No errors or logical mistakes are evident in the code; the logic is correct for its purpose.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Reasonableness of Scores:\n- The assigned scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), which is appropriate given the straightforward, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code's purpose is clear, and the approach is standard for handling signals during sleep.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n- The code could be improved by adding a maximum number of retries or a timeout to prevent potential indefinite blocking in edge cases, but this does not affect current scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at 0, as no security risks are present.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, well-understood pattern for signal-resilient sleep, with no security concerns.",
