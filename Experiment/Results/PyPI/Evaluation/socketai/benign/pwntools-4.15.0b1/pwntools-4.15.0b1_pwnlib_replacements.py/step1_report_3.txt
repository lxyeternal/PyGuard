{
  "purpose": "The code provides a custom implementation of the sleep function as a replacement for time.sleep(), with the intent to handle signal interruptions more gracefully.",
  "sources": "Reads the current time using __time.time() and the input parameter n.",
  "sinks": "Calls __time.sleep() with the remaining sleep duration; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input n is used to determine the end time; the loop repeatedly calculates remaining time and calls __time.sleep() with the remaining duration until sleep completes.",
  "anomalies": "The code reimplements a standard function without adding any malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The implementation is straightforward and intended to improve sleep handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the time module as __time and redefines sleep() to perform a loop that calculates the remaining sleep time, calling __time.sleep() with this value. This approach ensures that sleep() can handle signals that might interrupt the sleep call, potentially resuming sleep as needed. No suspicious or malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or malicious code, are evident. Usage of standard library functions is safe, and the code’s structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign reimplementation of time.sleep() aimed at improving signal handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
