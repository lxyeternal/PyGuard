{
  "purpose": "The code provides an improved sleep function that handles signals during sleep by busy-waiting until the specified duration has elapsed.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via __time.time() and calls __time.sleep() to pause execution.",
  "sinks": "The code calls __time.sleep() with a calculated duration, which could potentially be manipulated if the system clock is changed, but generally does not lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The function computes an end time, then enters a loop where it continually checks the remaining time and sleeps for that duration, until the total sleep time is completed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The replacement sleep function aims to handle signal interruptions, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the time module as __time to avoid namespace conflicts. It defines a sleep function that calculates an end timestamp and then enters a loop, sleeping for the remaining time until the total duration has passed. This approach ensures that signals interrupt sleep without terminating the sleep prematurely, unlike the standard time.sleep(). There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks. The code is straightforward and intended for improved sleep behavior.\n\nNo malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected. The code serves a benign purpose of reliably sleeping for a specified duration.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an interruptible sleep function with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It aims to improve reliability during signal handling without introducing security concerns.",
