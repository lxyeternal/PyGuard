{
  "purpose": "Provide an improved sleep function that continues sleeping until the specified time has elapsed, even if interrupted by signals.",
  "sources": "Reads current time via __time.time() and uses __time.sleep() to pause execution.",
  "sinks": "Calls __time.sleep() with calculated remaining time, which could be interrupted but is handled internally.",
  "flows": "Calculates end time, then repeatedly sleeps for the remaining duration until the total sleep time elapses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard library functions appropriately. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines a sleep function that internally loops, recalculating the remaining sleep duration after each interruption, to ensure the total sleep duration is achieved. It relies on standard library functions for time handling and sleep, with no external data inputs or outputs. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident. The approach improves robustness against signal interruptions but does not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a robust sleep replacement to ensure accurate sleep duration despite signals. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The logic is straightforward and uses standard library functions securely.",
