{
  "purpose": "Provide a replacement for the standard time.sleep() function that handles signals more robustly by actively polling until the total sleep time has elapsed.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current time via __time.time() repeatedly in a loop.",
  "sinks": "The code calls __time.sleep() with dynamically calculated sleep durations; no untrusted data is used in sink operations.",
  "flows": "The function calculates the end time, then repeatedly sleeps for the remaining duration until the total time has elapsed.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a custom sleep loop that actively polls the current time and calls sleep again, which could be seen as an unconventional approach but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the sleep() function to ensure it can handle signals more reliably by actively checking elapsed time and sleeping only for the remaining duration. It imports the standard time module as __time and uses it consistently. The implementation logic is straightforward: compute end time, loop until current time reaches or surpasses end, sleeping for the remaining time each iteration. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious code paths, and no obfuscation or malicious code behaviors detected. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides a more signal-resilient sleep implementation without any evident malicious intent or security risk. It appears to be a benign utility function intended for reliable sleep behavior.",
