{
  "purpose": "Provide an improved sleep function that handles signals gracefully by continuously sleeping until the specified duration has elapsed.",
  "sources": "Reads system time via __time.time() and invokes __time.sleep() in a loop.",
  "sinks": "Uses __time.sleep() with calculated remaining time to pause execution.",
  "flows": "Calculates end time, then repeatedly sleeps for the remaining duration until the total sleep time is reached.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code re-implements standard sleep with signal handling, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the sleep function to handle signals properly by looping until the total specified duration has passed. It uses the standard library's time functions, with no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior. There are no external data inputs or outputs that could leak data or be exploited. The code appears straightforward and intended solely to improve sleep behavior in signal scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign replacement for time.sleep() that ensures sleep completes despite signals. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
