{
  "purpose": "A custom sleep function that actively polls the current time and calls time.sleep() with the remaining duration to handle signals more reliably.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the system clock (__time.time()) to determine sleep duration.",
  "sinks": "Calls __time.sleep() with the remaining time; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Calculates end time, then in a loop, computes remaining time and calls __time.sleep() until total sleep duration elapses.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a signal-resilient sleep by recalculating remaining sleep time after each wake-up, ensuring robustness against signal interruptions. It uses standard library functions without external data handling or network activity. The logic is correct, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The approach is conventional for handling signals during sleep, with no security vulnerabilities or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for signal-safe sleeping, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals and behaviors are consistent with intended functionality, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
