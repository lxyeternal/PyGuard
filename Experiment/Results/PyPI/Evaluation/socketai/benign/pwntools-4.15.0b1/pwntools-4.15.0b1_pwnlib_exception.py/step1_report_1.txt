  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition with typical exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an initializer and a repr method that formats traceback information. It includes comments explaining its purpose. No external input, data leaks, or malicious code is present. The code appears standard and safe.",
