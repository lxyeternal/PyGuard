  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines a custom exception class with traceback info.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data or untrusted input involved.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward class, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Custom error handling class.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Uses internal parameters and system traceback info; no external data or code execution.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard exception class, no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, normal.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Error handling class.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data or unsafe operations.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical exception class with traceback formatting.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Error class with traceback info.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data, no network or file operations.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard class, safe.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception class with detailed traceback.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data or suspicious operations.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical, benign class.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is purely defining a custom exception class, with no code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. **Malware score should remain 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and unminified. No obfuscation detected. **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Risk score:** The code is a benign class definition, with no vulnerabilities or attack vectors. The highest risk could be from misusing exception handling, but that’s not a security issue per se. Given the uniform reports and no suspicious activity, **risk score should be 0.**\n\n### Final notes:\n- The detailed traceback inclusion does not introduce security issues in this context; it is a debugging aid.\n- No external data, no dangerous code, no signs of supply chain compromise.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
