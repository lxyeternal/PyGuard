  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling within a Python library, specifically for the pwnlib module.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data to external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be a straightforward class definition for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'PwnlibException' with an initializer that sets message, reason, and exit_code attributes. The __repr__ method formats a string representation, including traceback information if available. There are no hardcoded credentials, external data inputs, or suspicious behaviors. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The code appears to be a benign, standard exception class definition for a library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class definition intended for internal error handling within a Python library. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are detected.",
