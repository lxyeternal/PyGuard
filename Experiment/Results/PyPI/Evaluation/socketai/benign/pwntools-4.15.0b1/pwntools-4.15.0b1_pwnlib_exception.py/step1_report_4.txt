  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling within a library, specifically related to pwnlib.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data to external systems or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with methods to initialize and represent the exception. It uses traceback to format exception information in __repr__. The code does not process external data or perform operations that could be exploited maliciously. It primarily serves as an error-reporting utility within a larger library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
