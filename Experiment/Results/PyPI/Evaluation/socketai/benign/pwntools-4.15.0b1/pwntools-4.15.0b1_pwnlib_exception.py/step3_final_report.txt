{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class 'PwnlibException' with traceback formatting capabilities for error reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'msg', 'reason', 'exit_code'; accesses traceback info via 'traceback' and 'sys.exc_info()'.",
  "sinks": "Formats traceback information for display; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "From exception parameters and traceback info to formatted string in '__repr__'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard custom exception class that captures message and traceback info for debugging. It uses only standard modules and does not perform any external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present. The traceback formatting is used solely for debugging purposes within the exception representation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. It correctly implements an exception class with traceback info, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
