{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling in a Python library, with enhanced traceback information.",
  "sources": "None identified; the code only defines a class and imports standard modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definition with traceback formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'PwnlibException' inheriting from Exception, with a constructor that accepts a message, a reason, and an exit code. It customizes the string representation to include detailed traceback info if available. Imports are limited to 'sys' and 'traceback', standard modules. No data leakage, no network operations, and no suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be a typical, benign error-handling class meant for internal use within a larger library. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python exception class definition intended for error reporting with detailed traceback info. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and poses no security risk.",
