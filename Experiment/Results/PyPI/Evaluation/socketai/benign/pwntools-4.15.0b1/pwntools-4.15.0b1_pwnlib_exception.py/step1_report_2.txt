{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling within a Python library, specifically for pwnlib.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the input parameters 'msg', 'reason', and system traceback information via 'traceback.format_exception' and 'sys.exc_info'.",
  "sinks": "The traceback formatting functions output error details, but no untrusted data is used directly as a sink that could cause code execution or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (msg, reason) flow into the exception's attributes and string representation; traceback info is formatted and included in __repr__ method output. No external data flow to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The class is a straightforward custom exception implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with methods for initialization and string representation. It captures error messages and optional reasons, formatting traceback information for debugging. No malicious or suspicious logic, no external data injection, and no hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a debugging or error handling module. The code is safe and normal.",
