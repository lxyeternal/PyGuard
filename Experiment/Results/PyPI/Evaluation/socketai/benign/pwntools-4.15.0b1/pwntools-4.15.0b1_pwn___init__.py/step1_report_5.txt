{
  "purpose": "Initialize and configure the Pwntools library for exploit development or binary analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, pwn.toplevel, and pwnlib modules; platform.architecture() check.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to external systems or untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; initialization functions are called without user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code primarily performs standard library setup and environment checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and initializes Pwntools, a known security/penetration testing library. It checks system architecture and warns if not 64-bit. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs environment setup and version compatibility warnings, which are typical in development environments. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The use of warnings and environment checks are standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Pwntools with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate initialization code for exploit development purposes.",
