  "purpose": "Initialize and configure the Pwntools library for exploitation or binary analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, pwn.toplevel, and platform.architecture() for environment info.",
  "sinks": "None evident; code mainly sets up environment and logs; no data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Initialization functions set up environment variables and configurations, no flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. The code is standard for Pwntools setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for Pwntools, initializes arguments, logging, and configuration. It checks system architecture and issues a warning if not 64-bit. It sets up a local logging context. All steps are typical for a development environment and do not contain any malicious patterns or suspicious behavior. No data is read from untrusted sources nor written to external sinks. The code appears to be standard environment setup for legitimate security or exploitation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Pwntools, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only performs environment checks and initialization.",
