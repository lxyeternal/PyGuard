The high confidence in this assessment is supported by the absence of malicious patterns. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The broad import pattern warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent."

It is not malware but a powerful offensive tool that can be misused. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable; the malware score should be slightly adjusted upward to reflect its exploitative potential, but overall, the assessments are accurate."
