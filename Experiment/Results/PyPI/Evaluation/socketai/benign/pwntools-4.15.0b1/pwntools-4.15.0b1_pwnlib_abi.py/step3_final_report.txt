{
  "purpose": "Defines ABI and syscall conventions for various OS/architecture combinations used in exploit frameworks, providing static configuration data for low-level system interactions.",
  "sources": "Reads context parameters (os, arch, bits) to select appropriate ABI configurations; no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static data structures and mappings.",
  "flows": "Uses context variables to select predefined ABI and syscall configurations; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module defining ABI and syscall conventions for multiple platforms, relying on context parameters. It contains no dynamic data processing, network activity, or external input handling. The code is standard for exploit development frameworks like pwntools. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and content. The code's structure and static nature justify these scores, and the high confidence score (near 1) is appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module used for low-level system call and ABI setup across multiple platforms. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
