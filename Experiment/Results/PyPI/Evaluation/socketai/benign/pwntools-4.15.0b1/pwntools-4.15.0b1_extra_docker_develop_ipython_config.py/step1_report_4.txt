{
  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for IPython, setting various parameters for interactive shell behavior, prompts, history, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., PYTHONSTARTUP), IPython configuration parameters, imported modules (IPython.terminal.prompts.Prompts), class definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points include execution of environment variables or dynamically provided input (though none explicitly shown here). No clear data sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks are observable; the script mainly sets static configuration variables and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The class ClassicPrompts customizes prompts but does not execute untrusted code. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or network connections are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of configuration settings and a class for customizing prompts within IPython. No user input processing, network communication, or code execution is performed. All variables are static configuration parameters. The class definition for ClassicPrompts only affects prompt appearance. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears safe and purely for customizing IPython behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign IPython configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks. It only modifies the appearance and startup behavior of the IPython shell without executing external or untrusted code.",
