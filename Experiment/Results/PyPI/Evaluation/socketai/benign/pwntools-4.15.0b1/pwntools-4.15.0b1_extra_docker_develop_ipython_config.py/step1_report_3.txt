  "purpose": "Configuration settings for IPython and Terminal IPython applications, customizing prompts, startup behavior, history, and extensions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (not directly used in code), import statements, configuration parameters, class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets configuration options and defines prompt classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated code present. The code strictly appears to set configurations and define classes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration file for IPython, containing class definitions for prompts and numerous commented options for customization. It does not execute any untrusted input, network calls, or system modifications. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The file does not perform any actions beyond setting configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for IPython applications. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and there are no signs of malware, security risks, or obfuscation.",
