{
  "purpose": "This code is a static IPython configuration file setting parameters for the IPython shell environment, including prompt styles, startup behaviors, and extensions. It does not execute untrusted code or perform external data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (e.g., IPython.terminal.prompts), defines classes, and sets configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external data or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of configuration parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static configuration settings for IPython, including class definitions for prompts and commented-out options. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical configuration patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static IPython configuration file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
