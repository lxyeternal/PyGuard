  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign environment setup for exploit development with no signs of malicious activity. The high confidence in this assessment is supported by the absence of malicious patterns. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The broad import pattern warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent."
