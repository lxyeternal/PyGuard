{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup and installation of the pwntools package, including collecting templates, scripts, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "File system operations (os.walk, glob.glob, os.path), sys.argv for command-line arguments, reading 'pyproject.toml' for dependencies, checking for 'Python.h' in include paths.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() upon missing Python headers, modifying sys.argv, potentially executing setup functions with dynamic content.",
  "flows": "Reading 'pyproject.toml' -> checking sys.version_info -> manipulating sys.argv -> setup() configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of deprecated scripts and optional inclusion based on command-line flags are benign and typical for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment checks, collects files, and prepares configuration for package installation. It dynamically determines which scripts to include based on command-line flags and the environment. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The check for Python headers and conditional inclusion of dependencies are standard practices. No obfuscated or suspicious behavior detected. The use of 'pyproject.toml' and dynamic script generation are common in modern setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs environment checks, file collection, and configuration setup typical for package distribution. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
