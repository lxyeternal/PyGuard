  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'pwntools' Python library, used in security and exploit development.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations (os.walk, glob), command-line arguments (sys.argv), environment variables (sys.version_info, get_python_inc), package data files, and configuration files (pyproject.toml).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or code execution points are present.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data (templates, scripts) read during setup; environment info used for configuration; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: collecting template files, configuring package data, parsing command-line arguments, checking environment prerequisites, and defining console scripts. It uses common modules and practices without any network activity, code injection, or obfuscated constructs. The environment check for 'Python.h' is routine. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are evident. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and typical for a setup script, with no anomalies or signs of sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard Python package setup for 'pwntools' with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the code review.",
