  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for BentoML framework, including error handling and status codes.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources; static class definitions and initializations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks, external calls, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception classes are static and used internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscated code. Error codes and exception handling are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception class definitions, with error codes linked to HTTPStatus. The __init_subclass__ method manages class mappings. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. Usage of exception classes is standard for error handling in Python frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error handling in a Python framework. It contains no malicious or suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, or signs of obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
