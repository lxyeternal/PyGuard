  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on potential security implications, malware presence, obfuscation, and logical correctness.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling.\n   - No external data, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The code uses standard Python practices for defining exceptions, with class inheritance, class attributes, and a class-level error mapping.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the `__init_subclass__` method manages error code to class mappings, which is standard.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are detected.\n   - The reports correctly note the absence of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (~0.1) in some reports, justified by the potential for misconfiguration or misuse, but overall negligible.\n   - **Overall:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Malicious Behavior or Assumptions:**\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n   - The code is purely for structured error handling.\n   - No external inputs or untrusted data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Code Logic and Behavior:**\n   - The `error_mapping` dictionary is used to map error codes to exception classes during subclassing, which is a common pattern.\n   - The exception classes set error codes and messages appropriately.\n   - No suspicious or dangerous patterns are present.\n\n6. **Final Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - Based on all evidence, the code is safe.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n   - The code's purpose is purely to define exception classes for error handling.\n\n**Summary & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** or very close to zero, reflecting negligible security risk.\n\n**Estimated scores I would assign:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy for a Python framework. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
