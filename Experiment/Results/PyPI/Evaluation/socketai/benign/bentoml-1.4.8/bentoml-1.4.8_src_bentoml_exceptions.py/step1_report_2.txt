{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for BentoML with specific error codes and handling logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, class attributes, and class initialization.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and attribute settings could lead to error handling, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into exception constructors, which set messages and error codes; these do not lead to external systems or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The use of class-level dictionaries for error mappings is standard. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of exception classes for error handling within BentoML. The classes assign HTTP status codes and store messages, with some classes overriding or extending behavior. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only dynamic behavior involves managing error code mappings and exception initialization. All functions are typical for exception handling; no external or untrusted input processing is evident beyond standard parameter passing. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a structural role for error management.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Python library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for error categorization and handling without exposing vulnerabilities.",
