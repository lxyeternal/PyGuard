  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the BentoML framework.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; only internal class definitions and inheritance.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and super().__init__ calls, which are standard for error raising.",
  "flows": "Error object creation flows when exceptions are raised in the application code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code, no obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the BentoML system. It uses standard Python practices for exception handling, class inheritance, and class attribute management. The 'error_mapping' in 'BentoMLException' dynamically maps error codes to exception classes during subclassing. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears straightforward and intended for structured error handling without any suspicious behavior or malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious backdoors, and no potentially harmful side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions for error management within a framework. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and solely focused on structured error handling.",
