  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in BentoML, including various specific error types and error mapping.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and their initialization methods, particularly __init__ and __init_subclass__.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and subclassing; no direct data leakage or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects, especially __init__ methods which set error messages and codes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly defines error classes with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes inheriting from base Exception or a custom BentoMLException, with some classes setting HTTP status codes. The __init_subclass__ method in BentoMLException manages an error mapping, but it is standard practice for class registration. No external data sources, input/output handling, or network communication occurs. There are no signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious activities. The code appears to be a straightforward error handling structure intended for robust API error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project. No malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or suspicious logic are present. It is a safe, well-structured module for defining exceptions.",
