{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for error handling within the BentoML framework, associating error codes with exception types and enabling structured error management.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, class attributes (error_code, error_mapping), and the __init__ method for setting messages and error codes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or external inputs; exception raising is internal and controlled.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are instantiated with messages and optional error codes; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard Python exception patterns, with dynamic registration of error codes via __init_subclass__.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with error code mapping. It employs standard Python features such as class inheritance, class attributes, and __init__ methods. The use of __init_subclass__ for error code registration is a common pattern. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The exception classes serve purely for structured error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard, and well-structured exception hierarchy for the BentoML framework. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
