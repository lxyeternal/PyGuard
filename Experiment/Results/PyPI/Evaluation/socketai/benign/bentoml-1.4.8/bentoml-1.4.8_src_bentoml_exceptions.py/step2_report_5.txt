  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes, with dynamic error code mapping via `__init_subclass__`. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code is straightforward, with standard exception handling patterns. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score is 0, which is appropriate. Security risk is 0, consistent with the report.\n- **Conclusion:** The report is correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed reasoning about class attributes, error code mapping, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard exception hierarchy. No external data, network calls, or malicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1 is acceptable given the static nature of the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the exception classes, with no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the class inheritance, error code mapping, and standard exception patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious logic.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1 is reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the exception classes.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1 is suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code, malware, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the potential for misconfiguration or misuse, but overall very low.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minor, mostly due to the potential for misconfiguration, but not a security threat.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy for error handling within the BentoML framework. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.",
