  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the BentoML framework, including mechanisms for error codes and specific exception types.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, class variables, and initializers (__init__, __init_subclass__) within exception classes.",
  "sinks": "Raising exceptions, setting error codes, and class inheritance structures.",
  "flows": "Class definition and inheritance → Exception instantiation → Raising exceptions during runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious behavior, and no dynamic code execution. Error code mappings are standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard exception class definitions with error codes mapped to HTTP statuses, and custom exception subclasses for specific error cases. The __init_subclass__ method is used to register subclasses with their error codes in a class-level dictionary, which is a typical pattern for error handling. The constructors set message and error code attributes, which are then used when exceptions are raised. No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be well-structured for error handling within a framework and does not contain malicious intent or dangerous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with error codes, designed for structured error handling in the BentoML framework. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
