  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines custom exception classes for error handling.\n- Findings: No external input, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- Analysis: Straightforward class hierarchy, standard Python exception handling, dynamic error mapping via __init_subclass__.\n- Conclusion: No malware or security risk.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0 (appropriate given the content)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining exceptions with error codes.\n- Findings: No external data, no malicious behavior, standard pattern.\n- Analysis: No external calls, no data leaks, no suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard exception definitions.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1 (minimal, given the nature of exception handling, but still negligible)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines custom exceptions, error codes, and mappings.\n- Findings: No external data, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Standard class inheritance, no suspicious logic.\n- Conclusion: No security issues.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0.1 (again, negligible)\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes with error handling.\n- Findings: No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Typical pattern for error classes, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes, error codes, mappings.\n- Findings: No external data, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern, no signs of malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is purely for structured error handling.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of exception class definitions, the risk is minimal. The highest is 0.1, which is acceptable for such code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of backdoors, malware, or malicious behavior.\n- The dynamic error mapping via __init_subclass__ is a common pattern for error registration.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n\n### My estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (the minimal inherent risk in exception handling code)\n\nThis review confirms that the code is safe, standard, and free of security issues.",
