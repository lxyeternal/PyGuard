{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Triton inference server runner class, managing server initialization, client interaction, and resource handling for ML model deployment and inference.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include constructor parameters, environment-based configuration functions (_get_debug_mode), and dynamic port reservation utilities. Data is read during server configuration, port reservation, and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flow could occur through __getattr__ method if model names or client method calls are derived from external input. The code calls external clients (tritonclient) for inference, but these are standard libraries and do not appear malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters and environment configs into server setup and port allocation; external method calls (e.g., to triton clients) depend on dynamically accessed attributes, which could lead to remote interactions but are standard in design.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are identified. The code uses dynamic attribute access in a controlled manner, with proper validation of CLI args. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages Triton server setup, client interactions, and resource management using standard Python features, type hints, and dependency injection. There are no signs of data leaks, code injection, or malicious backdoors. The dynamic attribute access is well-structured to wrap valid methods and model names. No malicious behaviors such as data theft, remote control, or covert communication are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate and secure implementation of a Triton server runner, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard patterns for server management and dynamic method handling, with no suspicious or malicious code segments.",
