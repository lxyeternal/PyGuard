  "purpose": "A Triton server runner class managing inference server lifecycle, configuration, and client interactions with dynamic attribute access.",
  "sources": "CLI argument construction, external client method calls, environment configurations, lazy loader modules.",
  "sinks": "External client method invocations via __getattr__, dynamic port reservation, configuration validation.",
  "flows": "Attribute access routes to either client methods or model handlers; CLI args influence server setup; external modules are lazy loaded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of dynamic attribute access is controlled and standard for proxy classes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured proxy/wrapper for Triton inference server management, employing dependency injection, lazy loading, and dynamic attribute routing. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The dynamic __getattr__ method routes calls to known client methods or model handlers, which is a common pattern. Validation of CLI args and controlled external module loading mitigate potential risks. Overall, the code exhibits low security risk and no supply chain concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a Triton server runner with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The dynamic attribute access, while potentially exploitable if misused, is implemented safely and is typical for such proxy classes. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
