  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a Triton server runner class, handling inference and server management, with dynamic attribute access and dependency injection. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware observed.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, considering the dynamic attribute access and external client calls, but these are standard patterns.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical implementation with standard patterns. The dynamic attribute access (__getattr__) is controlled and used for proxying client methods or model handles, which is common in such systems. No suspicious behaviors or malicious intent are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing server setup, port reservation, and dynamic method access. No malicious activity or backdoors identified.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic attribute access routes calls to external clients, but this is a standard proxy pattern. No signs of malicious code or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration, environment, and dynamic attribute access. No malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic __getattr__ method routes to client methods or model handles, which is typical for such a proxy class. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar analysis, emphasizing server configuration, lazy loading, and dynamic method routing. No malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The code’s design is standard for a server management class. No malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a flexible server interaction class with dynamic method routing, no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic attribute access is controlled and typical for such client proxies. No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the clear, well-structured code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly varied but all low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the standard use of dynamic attribute access and external client calls, which are common and generally safe if used correctly.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- The code is a standard, secure implementation of a Triton server runner.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain risks.\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the code's logic and structure.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to dynamic attribute access and external client interactions, but these are typical and controlled.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary.",
