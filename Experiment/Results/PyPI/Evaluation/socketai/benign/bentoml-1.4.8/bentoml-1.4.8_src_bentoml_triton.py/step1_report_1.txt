  "purpose": "Define a Triton model server runner class for handling inference and server management in a distributed environment.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class constructor, methods accessing self attributes, dynamic attribute access (__getattr__), and configuration functions.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute access in __getattr__, use of injected dependencies, calls to external clients (tritonclient), and potentially untrusted CLI args.",
  "flows": "Initialization of CLI args based on server type -> attribute access in __getattr__ -> calls to external tritonclient methods -> potential execution of untrusted code if external data influences client methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access (__getattr__) that depends on internal state and external client methods; injection of CLI args directly in constructor; lazy loader for external modules which could be manipulated; no explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or hidden functionalities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Triton inference server runner with configurable options. It uses dependency injection, lazy loading, and dynamic attribute handling for client methods and model names. There is a potential concern in __getattr__ where external client methods are called based on string attributes, which could be exploited if external data influences the attribute name. However, these are standard patterns for proxying client methods, and no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The CLI args are constructed securely from parameters, with validation to prevent malformed arguments. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or remote command execution is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a Triton server runner class with dynamic method handling. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage is found. It is designed for managing server connections and inference calls, with typical safeguards and dependency management. The overall security risk is low.",
