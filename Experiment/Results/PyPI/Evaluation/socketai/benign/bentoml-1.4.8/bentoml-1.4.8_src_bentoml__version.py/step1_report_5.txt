{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and sets version variables.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string and tuple assignments to version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input handling; no data leaks or insecure operations present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version string to version variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code is straightforward and typical for version definition.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version-related variables, including __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple, with hardcoded static values. It includes conditional typing annotations for development-time checks but does not include any input processing, network activity, or executable logic that could be malicious. The structure is simple, with no obfuscated or unusual language features. It appears to be a standard autogenerated version file, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition file generated by setuptools-scm, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely assigns static version information and includes type hints for development purposes.",
