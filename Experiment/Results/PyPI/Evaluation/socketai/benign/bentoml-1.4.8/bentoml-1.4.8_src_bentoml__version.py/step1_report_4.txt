No external inputs, no data processing, no code execution, and no network activity. The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated module for version info management without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This module simply defines version information with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a benign, auto-generated snippet used for package versioning.",
