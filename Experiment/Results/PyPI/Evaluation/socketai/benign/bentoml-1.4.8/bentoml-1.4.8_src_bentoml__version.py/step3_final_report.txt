  "purpose": "Defines static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings (__version__, version) and version tuples (__version_tuple__, version_tuple). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; static data assignments with no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as data is statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with standard type hints and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, auto-generated module that assigns static version strings and tuples, with conditional type hints for static analysis. It contains no dynamic code, external input, network activity, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code's purpose is solely to provide version info, with no security-sensitive operations or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version info module with no malicious or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
