  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and version tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static assignment of version variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard version info setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables for a package, using static strings and tuples. It includes conditional type hinting imports which do not execute at runtime, and assigns version info directly. There are no inputs, no external data handling, and no suspicious code segments. The code appears to be auto-generated and intended solely for version management, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version information setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It is safe and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
