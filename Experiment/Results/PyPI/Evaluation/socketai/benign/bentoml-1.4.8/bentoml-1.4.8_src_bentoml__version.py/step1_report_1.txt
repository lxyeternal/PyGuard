  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Constants and variable assignments, particularly the version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly leads untrusted data to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version strings to variables; no data flow from external sources or untrusted input to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated structures detected. The code is straightforward version info setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version information using static strings and tuples. It includes conditional typing imports, which are standard for type checking. No dynamic execution, external input, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version definition module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
