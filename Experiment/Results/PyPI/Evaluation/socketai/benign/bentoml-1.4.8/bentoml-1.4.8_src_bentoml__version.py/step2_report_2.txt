  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Content:**\n   - The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version info module.\n   - It defines version strings and tuples, with no dynamic or external input.\n   - It uses standard practices such as conditional type hints.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and auto-generated.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - The code does not execute any untrusted input, perform network operations, or manipulate external systems.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's straightforward purpose.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns & Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that because the code is static and auto-generated, it cannot be malicious. This is reasonable.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions; the analysis is consistent.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Recommendations:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The detailed analysis supports that the code is safe.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n6. **My Expert Estimate:**\n   - **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a standard, auto-generated version info module with no malicious or security concerns. The provided scores are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign, straightforward, and correctly scored.  \n- No modifications needed.  \n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
