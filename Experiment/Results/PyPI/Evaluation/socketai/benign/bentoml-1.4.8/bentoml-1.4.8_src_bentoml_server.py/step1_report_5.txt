  "purpose": "Defines server classes for managing BentoML server processes, including HTTP and gRPC servers, with methods to start, stop, and retrieve clients.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to constructors, environment variables, subprocess output streams.",
  "sinks": "Process output streams (stdout, stderr), environment variables, subprocess control (kill, terminate).",
  "flows": "Start server -> process output streams are read during stop or error conditions; get_client retrieves client from running process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.Popen with environment variable manipulation, process management, and server control logic. No explicit hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns detected. Warnings about deprecation are present but not malicious. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages server processes via subprocesses, with methods to start, stop, and communicate with these processes. It uses environment variables for process control, reads process output streams during error handling, and manages SSL and timeout configurations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors, is present. The code appears to be standard server process management with appropriate warnings and error handling. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are found. It is well-structured for its purpose and contains no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical server management implementation for BentoML with no malicious behavior detected. It handles subprocess management securely, with appropriate error handling and process control. No indications of malware, data leakage, or sabotage are present.",
