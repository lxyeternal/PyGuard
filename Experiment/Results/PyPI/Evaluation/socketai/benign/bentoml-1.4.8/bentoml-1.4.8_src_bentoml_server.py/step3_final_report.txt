{
  "purpose": "The code manages server processes for BentoML, including starting, stopping, and client retrieval, with environment variable handling and SSL configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., BENTOML_SERVE_FROM_SERVER_API), subprocess.Popen calls, command-line argument construction, SSL config parameters.",
  "sinks": "Process control commands, environment variable modifications, subprocess streams (stdout/stderr), network configurations (SSL).",
  "flows": "Initialization of server args -> subprocess.Popen execution -> environment variable setting -> process lifecycle management -> client retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Usage of environment variables and subprocesses aligns with standard server management practices.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard process management techniques, environment variable coordination, and SSL configuration for server lifecycle control. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The environment variable 'BENTOML_SERVE_FROM_SERVER_API' is used for process coordination, which is typical. The subprocess handling includes proper error and process state checks. The deprecation warnings are informational, not malicious. The code structure is clear, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk score to 0.2, reflecting operational risk but no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured server management framework for BentoML, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and the code appears safe for use.",
