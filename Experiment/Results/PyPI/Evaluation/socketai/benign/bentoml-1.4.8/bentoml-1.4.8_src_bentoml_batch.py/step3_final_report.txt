{
  "purpose": "This code module imports a function 'run_in_spark' from an internal package and exposes it via __all__, serving as a simple interface wrapper.",
  "sources": "Import statement from internal module '._internal.batch.spark' for 'run_in_spark'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'run_in_spark' and exposes it directly; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward import and export.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a function from an internal module and exposing it via __all__. No data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security issues. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The internal import path suggests internal organization rather than malicious activity. Overall, the code is a benign interface wrapper with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
