{
  "purpose": "Expose a single function 'run_in_spark' imported from an internal module, likely intended for batch processing with Spark.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'run_in_spark' from a relative internal module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external outputs are directly involved in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only defines imports and exports without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with standard import statements; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an internal module and declares it as part of its public API. It uses __future__ import for annotations, which is standard for forward references. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or obfuscated code. The import path suggests internal structure, but nothing malicious is evident from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
