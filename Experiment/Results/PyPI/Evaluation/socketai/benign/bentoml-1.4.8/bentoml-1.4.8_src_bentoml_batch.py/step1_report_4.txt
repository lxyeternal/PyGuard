  "purpose": "Export a function 'run_in_spark' from an internal module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'run_in_spark' from a relative internal module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only imports and exports a function",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no unusual patterns, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'run_in_spark' from an internal package and exposes it via __all__. It uses __future__ annotations for type hints, which is standard practice. No input reading, data leaks, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a simple module wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module exporting a function from an internal submodule without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
