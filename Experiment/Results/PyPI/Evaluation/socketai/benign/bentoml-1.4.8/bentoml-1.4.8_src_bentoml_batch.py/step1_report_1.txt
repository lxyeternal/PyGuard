{
  "purpose": "Export the function run_in_spark from an internal module for external use",
  "sources": "Import statement for __future__ annotations, import statement for run_in_spark",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted input/output observed",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature for annotations, which is standard practice for compatibility. It then imports a function from an internal module and exposes it via __all__. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code. The code structure is straightforward, with no apparent data leakage, external network access, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, benign module setup that exports a single function. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
