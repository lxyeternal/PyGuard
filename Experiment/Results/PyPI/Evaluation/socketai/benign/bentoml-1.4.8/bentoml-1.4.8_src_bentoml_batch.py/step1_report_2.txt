  "purpose": "Export a function 'run_in_spark' for batch processing using Spark within an internal module",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative internal module: ._internal.batch.spark",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data output functions are present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are identifiable in this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a function from an internal package and exposes it via __all__. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. The import path suggests internal organization, and the code adheres to standard Python practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks, and no complex logic or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module exposing an internal function without any malicious intent or security issues. It is a minimal, benign implementation focused on module organization.",
