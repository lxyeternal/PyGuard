{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for running a function 'run_in_spark' from an internal module, likely to execute Spark jobs.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'run_in_spark' from a relative internal module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there is no data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; the code only sets up an import and exposes a function.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with only an import and export; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from an internal package and exposes it via __all__, which is a common pattern in Python modules. There are no data inputs, outputs, or operations that could be malicious. The module's content appears standard and does not perform any malicious activity or contain obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports an internal function for external use.",
