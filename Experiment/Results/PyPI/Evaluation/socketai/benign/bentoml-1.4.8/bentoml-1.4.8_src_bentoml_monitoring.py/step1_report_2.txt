{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's public API, exposing monitoring classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from internal monitoring modules within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data leaks or effects are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only re-exports internal components.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports from internal modules (prefixed with _), which is typical for package internal structure, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules (_internal.monitoring) and exposes them in __all__, which controls the public API. There are no data processing, user inputs, or network interactions. The code structure is straightforward and standard for package API exposure. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. It simply acts as a façade for internal monitoring components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module re-export pattern exposing internal monitoring classes and functions. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code appears safe and benign.",
