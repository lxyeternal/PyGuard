  "purpose": "The code re-exports classes and functions related to monitoring from an internal module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._internal.monitoring module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly re-exports",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions related to monitoring from an internal module and then defines __all__ for export. It does not process data, execute untrusted code, or perform any network or system operations. It appears to be a standard re-export module with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module re-export with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It is safe and typical in Python package design.",
