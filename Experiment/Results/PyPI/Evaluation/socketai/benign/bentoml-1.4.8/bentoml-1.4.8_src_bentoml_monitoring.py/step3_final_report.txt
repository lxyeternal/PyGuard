  "purpose": "Re-exporting internal monitoring classes/functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from ._internal.monitoring module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; no data leaks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Import from internal module to __all__ export; no data flow beyond module scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three components from an internal module and exposes them via __all__, serving as a simple API re-export. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, data processing, or suspicious patterns. The code structure is standard for Python package modules. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
