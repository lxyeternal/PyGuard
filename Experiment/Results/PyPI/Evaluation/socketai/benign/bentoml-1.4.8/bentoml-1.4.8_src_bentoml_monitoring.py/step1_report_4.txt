  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes and functions from internal monitoring module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal module '._internal.monitoring'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only re-exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from an internal monitoring module and exposes them via __all__ for external use. There are no data manipulations, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be a straightforward module re-export without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely re-exports monitoring classes and functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard practice for Python modules. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
