  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python library for handling IMAP email interactions, providing imports for various classes and functions related to email processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current module's imported submodules (.query, .mailbox, .message, .folder, .consts, .utils, .errors). No external input or untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code does not process or pass data through source-to-sink pathways; it only imports classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code contains standard Python import statements and module metadata comments.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of module import statements and metadata comments, with no runtime logic or data processing. It follows standard Python module structure without any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or potential attack vectors within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical library setup with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for a Python package intended for email processing.",
