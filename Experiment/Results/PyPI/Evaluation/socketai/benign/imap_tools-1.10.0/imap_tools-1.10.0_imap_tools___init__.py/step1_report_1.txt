  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of an open-source library for IMAP email management, providing modules for querying, mailbox handling, message processing, folder management, constants, utilities, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.query, .mailbox, .message, .folder, .consts, .utils, .errors). No external data sources or input handling shown.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks such as network connections, file operations, or system commands. The code mainly imports classes and constants.",
  "flows": "No active data flows or execution paths are evident, as this is primarily an import statement module setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of import statements with metadata comments. It establishes a library's structure and dependencies. No actual executable logic or data processing present in this snippet. There are no indications of malicious code or malicious intent. The license and author comments are typical for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import setup for an open-source IMAP email toolkit. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and well-structured, with no suspicious activity observed.",
