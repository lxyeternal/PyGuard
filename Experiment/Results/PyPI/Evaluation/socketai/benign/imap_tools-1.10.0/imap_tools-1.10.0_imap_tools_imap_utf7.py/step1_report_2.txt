{
  "purpose": "This code encodes and decodes strings using a modified UTF-7 encoding, as described in RFC 3501, mainly for IMAP mailbox names.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings for encoding; reads byte sequences for decoding; the functions process these data inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code processes and outputs encoded bytes or decoded strings; no direct data leaks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed character-by-character for encoding, and byte-by-byte for decoding; the data flows through transformation functions involving base64 encoding/decoding.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard library functions for base64 operations; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation; code appears straightforward and purpose-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code properly implements RFC 3501 modified UTF-7 encoding and decoding, handling base64 conversions and special characters. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. Functions operate solely on input data, with no network access, external system modifications, or credential handling. The base64 modifications are consistent with the RFC. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malware functionalities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of RFC 3501 modified UTF-7 encoding/decoding for mailbox names. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
