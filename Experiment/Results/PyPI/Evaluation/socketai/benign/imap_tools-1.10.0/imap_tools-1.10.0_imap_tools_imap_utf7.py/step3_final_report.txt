  "purpose": "Implement RFC 3501 modified UTF-7 encoding and decoding for IMAP mailbox names, handling special characters and base64 transformations as specified.",
  "sources": "Input string characters during encoding; encoded base64 segments during decoding.",
  "sinks": "Encoded byte sequences representing mailbox names; decoding output strings.",
  "flows": "Characters are processed sequentially; ASCII characters directly appended; '&' triggers special encoding; base64 segments decoded back to characters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard library usage; proper handling of special characters; no obfuscation or external system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements RFC 3501 modified UTF-7 encoding and decoding using standard Python libraries. It handles special characters '&' and '-' appropriately, performs base64 transformations with necessary character replacements, and processes input strings in a straightforward manner. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is purpose-specific and aligns with RFC specifications. The absence of external calls or network activity indicates a benign utility module. All signals point to a safe, standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standards-compliant RFC 3501 modified UTF-7 encoder/decoder for IMAP mailbox names. It exhibits no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal potential for misuse but no inherent threat.",
