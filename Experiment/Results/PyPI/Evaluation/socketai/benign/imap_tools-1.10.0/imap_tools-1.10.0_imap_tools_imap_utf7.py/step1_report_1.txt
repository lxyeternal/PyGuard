{
  "purpose": "Encode and decode UTF-7 strings according to RFC 3501, specifically for IMAP mailbox names with modified base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Reading input string for encoding; reading bytes during decoding.",
  "sinks": "None evident. No data is written to files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input string is processed character-by-character; during decoding, base64-encoded segments are decoded back to strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Uses standard binascii functions with typical encoding/decoding operations. The code properly manages base64 transformations and special characters. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements RFC 3501 modified UTF-7 encoding and decoding for IMAP mailbox names. It employs standard Python libraries (binascii) for base64 operations and performs character-based processing without executing untrusted data. The encoding function handles special characters and base64 segments correctly; the decoding function reconstructs original strings reliably. No evidence of malicious behavior, malicious data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a known encoding scheme with proper input handling and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard RFC 3501 UTF-7 encoding/decoding with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is a legitimate utility function for IMAP mailbox name processing. No security risks identified.",
