  "purpose": "Encode and decode UTF-7 strings based on RFC 3501 with specific modifications for IMAP4rev1.",
  "sources": "Input string for encoding; bytes for decoding.",
  "sinks": "Encoded bytes output; decoded string output.",
  "flows": "Input string is processed character-by-character, with base64 encoding/decoding applied to certain segments. Data flows from input to encoded output or decoded output depending on the operation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom base64 functions with specific character replacements; handling of '&' character as a special case; no apparent hardcoded secrets or credentials; no external network activity or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard UTF-7 encoding/decoding with modifications for IMAP. It uses standard libraries (binascii) for base64 operations, with custom adjustments (e.g., replacing '/' with ','). The encoding function converts characters into base64-encoded segments, wrapping them with '&' and '-' as per modified UTF-7. The decoding reverses this process. No external network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated code structures are present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are identified. The code seems straightforward and adheres to the intended encoding scheme, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of modified UTF-7 encoding/decoding for RFC 3501, with no malicious intent detected. It performs character encoding conversions as documented, with no signs of malicious or sabotage activity.",
