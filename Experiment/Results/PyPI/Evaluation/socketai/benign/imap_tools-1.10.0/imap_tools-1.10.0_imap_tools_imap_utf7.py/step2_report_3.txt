  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code's logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of RFC 3501 modified UTF-7 encoding/decoding, tailored for IMAP mailbox names.\n- It uses standard Python libraries (`binascii`) for base64 operations.\n- No external I/O, network activity, or environment modifications are evident.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The functions handle special characters (`&`, `-`) correctly according to RFC specifications.\n- The logic appears correct and purpose-specific.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Analysis of Reports\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate; confirms RFC 3501 compliance, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0.1`. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent, just encoding/decoding logic.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; confirms correctness and benign behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`. Perfectly aligned with the code's nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar; emphasizes safe use of `binascii`, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`. Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Reiterates correct implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`. Justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others; confirms proper handling and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. The code does not perform any malicious activity—no code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (`0.1` or `0`), reflecting minimal security concern, which is appropriate.\n\n**However,** considering the importance of the encoding scheme, the correctness, and the absence of any malicious indicators, I would **recommend the following:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (Confirmed safe)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (Clear code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (No security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented RFC 3501 modified UTF-7 encoder/decoder.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores in all reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided, but would emphasize that the malware score should remain at 0, given the benign nature.**\n\n---\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0**          |\n\nThis reflects the code's purpose, implementation, and the analysis provided.",
