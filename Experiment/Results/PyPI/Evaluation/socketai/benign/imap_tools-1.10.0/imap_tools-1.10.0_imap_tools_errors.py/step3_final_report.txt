{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for IMAP mailbox errors, facilitating error handling in an IMAP client or library.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs, network calls, or dynamic data; only class definitions and a __str__ method formatting error messages.",
  "sinks": "Error messages generated by __str__, but no untrusted data processing or external data leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward class definitions with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from a base error class, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or malicious patterns. The __str__ method provides formatted error messages based on command result tuples, which is standard. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes for IMAP error handling. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risky behavior is detected. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
