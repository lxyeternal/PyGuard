  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling IMAP mailbox errors",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading occurs; the code defines classes only",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code is purely class definitions",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class constructors and methods do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected; code is straightforward class hierarchy for error handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for various IMAP mailbox errors, inheriting from a base error class. The only method with logic is __str__, which formats error messages based on provided command result data. No data is read from external sources, and no data is sent to external systems. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure is typical for error handling in a Python library, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions intended for use in an IMAP-related library. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
