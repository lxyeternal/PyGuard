  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling IMAP mailbox errors in a Python library.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class definitions for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; only internal exception handling structures.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code is purely class definitions without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; all classes are standard exception subclasses. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exception classes for IMAP mailbox operations, primarily for error handling. It includes a base error class and specific subclasses for various mailbox-related errors, all inheriting from UnexpectedCommandStatusError, which stores command result details and expected status. The __str__ method provides descriptive error messages. The structure is standard and does not contain code injection, malicious logic, or obfuscated constructs. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or sensitive operations present in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions intended for error management in an IMAP client library. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and appears purely functional.",
