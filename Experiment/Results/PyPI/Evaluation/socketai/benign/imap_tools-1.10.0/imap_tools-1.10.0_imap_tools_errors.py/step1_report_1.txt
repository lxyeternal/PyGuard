  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling IMAP mailbox errors",
  "sources": "N/A (no data input or external data sources used in this code)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no handling of untrusted data or external output)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks; this code only defines exception classes)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code consists solely of class definitions with standard exception handling patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for various IMAP mailbox errors, all inheriting from a base error class. The __init__ method and __str__ methods are standard. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, external calls, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward and appears to serve as error handling scaffolding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling in an IMAP client context. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation of custom exceptions.",
