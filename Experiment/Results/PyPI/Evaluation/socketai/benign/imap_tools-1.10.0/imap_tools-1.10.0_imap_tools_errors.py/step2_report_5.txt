  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code verification**:\n   - The code only defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to IMAP mailbox errors.\n   - No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - The `__str__` method in `UnexpectedCommandStatusError` constructs error messages based on provided command result tuples, which is standard practice.\n   - No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and benign.\n   - They note the absence of external data handling, network calls, or obfuscated code.\n   - No issues or flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores review**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, which aligns with the clear and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5**:\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or pose security risks.\n   - No external inputs, no code execution, no data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations**:\n   - The code contains no malicious logic.\n   - The exception classes are standard and serve error handling purposes.\n   - No malware behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They focus solely on structural analysis.\n\n7. **Score consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for an IMAP client or library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and should remain as such.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nI concur with the reports' evaluations. The code is safe, straightforward, and purely structural. No further action or concern is necessary.",
