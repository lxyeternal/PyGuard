  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various IMAP mailbox errors in an email client or library.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or data leaks; no sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception messages are generated only during error handling, not from external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance with custom error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base error class, with some classes providing custom __init__ and __str__ methods for error reporting. There is no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious patterns. The structure is standard and clear. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be designed solely for error handling within an IMAP email client context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured custom exception classes for email IMAP errors with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
