  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions related to IMAP mailbox errors.\n- No code injection, external data handling, or insecure operations are present.\n- The classes are straightforward, inherit properly, and the __str__ method provides informative error messages.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, purely structural, and standard for error handling.\n- No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in the analysis.\n- The reasoning is consistent: no malicious patterns, no external dependencies, no suspicious behaviors.\n\n**3. Review of Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), aligning with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- Since the code contains no malicious or insecure behavior, risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The reports' assessments are justified.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network activity, no data exfiltration, no backdoors.\n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**6. Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they only describe the code's structure.\n- No unwarranted claims are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- All reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior detected.\n- The reports' evaluations are accurate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and serves as a typical error handling scaffold for an IMAP client or library. No further action needed.",
