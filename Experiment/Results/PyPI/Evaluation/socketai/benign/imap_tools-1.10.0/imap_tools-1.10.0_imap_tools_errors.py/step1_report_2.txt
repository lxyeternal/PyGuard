{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for IMAP mailbox operations errors",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions and no input reading or data handling",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is solely class definitions without data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward class inheritance for error handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of exception class definitions for handling various IMAP mailbox errors, inheriting from a base error class. The __init__ and __str__ methods are standard for custom exceptions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious code segments. The code does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or contain obfuscated code. It appears to be a typical error handling module intended for use in a larger IMAP client or server application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception classes for handling IMAP mailbox errors with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural and does not execute any harmful operations.",
