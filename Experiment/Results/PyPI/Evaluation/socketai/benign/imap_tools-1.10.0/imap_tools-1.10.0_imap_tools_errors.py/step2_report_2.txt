  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling IMAP mailbox errors.\n- All classes inherit from a base error class.\n- The __init__ and __str__ methods are standard, with __str__ providing formatted error messages.\n- There are no external data inputs, network calls, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is purely structural, intended for error handling in an IMAP client or library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code is just class definitions with no malicious or insecure operations.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears correct and follows standard Python exception class patterns.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None. The code is purely structural, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n\n- **Malware score reflection?**  \n  The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports base their conclusions on the straightforward nature of the code, without unwarranted assumptions.\n\n- **Scores consistency?**  \n  Yes. All scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely structural, with no dynamic behavior, external inputs, or malicious logic. The exception classes are standard and do not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Confirm the scores as they are—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**End of review.**",
