{
  "purpose": "Define constants, regex patterns, and classes related to email message flags, mailbox folder statuses, and sorting criteria in an email handling system.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern for UID extraction, reading sys.version_info, class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines constants and regex patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static definitions: regex for UID pattern, constants for email flags and mailbox options, and class attributes for sorting criteria. The UID regex could be used to parse untrusted data, but this is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No external network access, code execution, or data handling involving sensitive info is present. No obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of constants, regex, and class definitions related to email processing. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
