  "purpose": "Define constants, patterns, and classes related to email message handling, folder status, and sorting criteria in an email system.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info.minor (reading Python version), re.compile (compiling regex pattern), module imports (re, sys).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily defines constants and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; code is straightforward constant and class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules re and sys, defines regex pattern for UID extraction, constants for month names and special characters, and several classes for email flags, mailbox statuses, and sorting criteria. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection, or dynamic execution. No suspicious data handling or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be standard, static definitions for an email processing system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining constants and classes for email message handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment.",
