  "purpose": "Defines constants, regex patterns, and classes for email message handling and mailbox status, serving as configuration or utility code.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern for UID extraction, sys.version_info for version checks, class attributes for email flags and mailbox options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Regex pattern used for pattern matching UID values; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static constants, class definitions, and a simple regex pattern for UID matching. It does not perform any dynamic data processing, external input handling, or network operations. The regex pattern is standard and used for pattern matching, not malicious parsing. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be part of an email handling system's configuration module, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration for email processing, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
