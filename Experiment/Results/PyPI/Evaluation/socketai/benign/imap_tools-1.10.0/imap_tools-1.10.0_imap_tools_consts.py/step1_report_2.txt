{
  "purpose": "The code defines constants, regex patterns, and classes related to email message flags, mailbox folder status options, and sorting criteria, likely for an email client or server implementation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from regular expressions, system version info, and predefined constants within classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident data sinks or points where untrusted data is used in a manner that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The data flows from regex pattern matching and constants to class attributes used for email handling; no external input flows into critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static definitions, including regex pattern compilation, constant tuples, and class attribute declarations for email message flags, mailbox statuses, and sorting options. It uses system version info for minor version detection. There are no dynamic code execution, user input processing, or insecure operations. The regex pattern is straightforward and used for pattern matching UID values. All constants and class definitions appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious set of definitions related to email handling. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, nor does it perform any operations that could compromise security.",
