  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a benign constants and regex setup for email handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious logic.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to report 1, no malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Comments:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Static definitions, regex for UID extraction, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, aligned with the benign analysis.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Static constants, regex, no external data handling or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Standard static definitions, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** All zeros.\n- **Comments:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, and the code is purely static configuration.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; all code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of dynamic data handling, external inputs, or any suspicious patterns, the overall security risk remains negligible.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a collection of constants, regex patterns, and class definitions for email processing, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The regex pattern for UID is standard and used for pattern matching, not malicious parsing.\n- The use of sys.version_info is benign and for compatibility checks.\n- There are no external data flows, code execution, or secret handling.\n\n### **Recommended Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, just as a precaution, but practically zero)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for email handling systems. The current report scores are appropriate and should not be changed.",
