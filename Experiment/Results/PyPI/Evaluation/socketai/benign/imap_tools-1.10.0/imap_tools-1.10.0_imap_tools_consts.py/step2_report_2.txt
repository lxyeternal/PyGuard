  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It mainly consists of constant definitions, class declarations, and a regex pattern for UID extraction.\n- Uses standard modules (re, sys).\n- No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or sensitive data handling.\n- Regex pattern for UID is straightforward.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- No evident malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Concludes the code is benign, with a malware score of 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is static, with no malicious logic.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also finds the code non-malicious, static definitions, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The regex could be used to parse untrusted data, but that alone isn't malicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n**No changes needed.**\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar conclusion: static constants, straightforward regex, no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same reasoning: no malicious behavior, static definitions, no external data processing.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also finds the code benign, static, and standard.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no malicious activity, no external vulnerabilities, and the code is purely static configuration, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type     | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0 — No malicious code, no suspicious patterns, static constants. |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.      |\n| Security Risk  | 0.0 — No vulnerabilities, no external inputs, no data leaks. |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should remain at 0 for all categories.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at **0.0**.  \n- No further action needed.",
