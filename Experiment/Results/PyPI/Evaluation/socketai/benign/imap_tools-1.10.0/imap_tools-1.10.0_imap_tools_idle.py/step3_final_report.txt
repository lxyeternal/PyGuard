{
  "purpose": "Manage IMAP IDLE protocol interactions, including starting, stopping, polling for responses, and handling socket communication within an email client context.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from socket via _get_line(), socket object via sock.gettimeout(), and mailbox.client methods such as _command and send.",
  "sinks": "Sends data through mailbox.client.send(), processes server responses via _get_response() and _get_line(), and manipulates socket timeouts.",
  "flows": "Source data from socket and mailbox methods flow into response handling and response collection; socket timeout settings influence socket.read operations; responses are collected and returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors; standard exception handling; socket timeout adjustments are typical for network code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard IMAP IDLE management with proper socket polling, response parsing, and exception handling. It uses common Python libraries and patterns. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is evident. The socket timeout manipulations are typical for network responsiveness. All responses correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.2), which aligns with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of IMAP IDLE handling, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score is appropriate given its network communication role, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero.",
