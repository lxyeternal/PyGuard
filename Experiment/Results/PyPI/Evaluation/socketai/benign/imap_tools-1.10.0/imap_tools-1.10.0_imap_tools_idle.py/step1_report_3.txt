  "purpose": "Implements IMAP4 IDLE command handling for mailbox monitoring and socket polling",
  "sources": "Reads socket data via socket.socket and select.poll/select.select, and retrieves IMAP responses using internal mailbox methods",
  "sinks": "Processes responses from mailbox._get_line(), and sends 'DONE' command over socket",
  "flows": "Socket data is read in get_socket_poller() and IdleManager.poll(); responses are fetched via mailbox._get_line() and processed; 'DONE' command is sent in stop()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. Use of socket and select modules for network IO is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. Exception handling is standard; no external data leaks or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an implementation for managing IMAP IDLE sessions, polling sockets for incoming data, and handling start/stop of IDLE mode. It uses standard Python libraries and methods, with proper exception handling and socket timeout management. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity, are present. The code structure and logic are consistent with normal IMAP client operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation for IMAP mailbox IDLE handling. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. The code functions as expected for monitoring mailboxes without any malicious intent.",
