  "purpose": "Provides IMAP IDLE management and socket polling utilities for mailbox monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads from socket (sock.fileno()), mailbox.client._command, mailbox.client._get_response, mailbox.client.send, mailbox.consume_until_tagged_response, mailbox.client._get_line, sys.exc_info()",
  "sinks": "Uses socket.send() to send 'DONE\r\n', calls mailbox methods that may send/receive data, reads socket responses, and captures exception info",
  "flows": "Socket polling and response reading originate from mailbox.client methods, which receive responses from the server; socket.settimeout modifies socket behavior during polling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; exception handling is normal but captures system info; no malicious command execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code manages IMAP IDLE protocol, including starting, stopping, and polling for responses via socket operations. It uses standard library functions and mailbox client methods for communication. No suspicious data handling, command injection, or malicious payloads are evident. Socket operations and response handling follow typical patterns for network communication. Exception handling captures system exceptions but does not process or leak sensitive info maliciously. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of IMAP IDLE management and socket polling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected socket and mailbox interactions without suspicious or harmful actions.",
