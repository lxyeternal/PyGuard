{
  "purpose": "This code manages IMAP email mailbox IDLE state, allowing efficient polling for new messages or responses from the server.",
  "sources": "Reads from socket (via socket.gettimeout, socket.settimeout, socket.socket methods), input from mailbox.client methods (_command, _get_response, _get_line, send, consume_until_tagged_response).",
  "sinks": "Uses mailbox.client methods to send commands and retrieve responses, interacts with socket for polling, potentially exposing socket data during get_line or poll operations.",
  "flows": "Source: mailbox.client._get_line, _get_response, socket.recv, socket.poll; Sink: mailbox.client.send, consume_until_tagged_response, socket.settimeout; Flow involves polling socket, reading lines, and sending IMAP commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of standard libraries, socket, select, imaplib is appropriate. No obfuscation, encryption, or unusual code patterns. No external data exfiltration, no data leaks, no malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of IMAP IDLE management, using socket polling and command handling. It employs proper socket timeout handling, exception management for socket and IMAP errors, and standard IMAP command flows. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The code performs typical mailbox IDLE functions, with correct safety checks (e.g., timeout validation). No suspicious external communications or credential leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for managing IMAP IDLE connections without malicious intent. It handles socket operations securely, with no signs of malware or malicious data exfiltration. The overall security risk is low.",
