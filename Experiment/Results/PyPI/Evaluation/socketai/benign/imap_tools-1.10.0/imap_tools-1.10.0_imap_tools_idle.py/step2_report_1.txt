  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code manages IMAP IDLE commands, socket polling, and response handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified across reports.\n- The code uses standard Python libraries and typical patterns for network communication.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- Exception handling and socket management are appropriate and standard.\n- The responses from the reports consistently assign low security risk and malware scores (around 0.1–0.2, and 0 respectively).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears functionally correct for IMAP IDLE management.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Secrets or credentials:** Not present.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evident vulnerabilities like command injection, data leaks, or insecure socket handling beyond normal expectations.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly higher (0.1–0.2), reflecting the inherent risks in socket/network code but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Reports:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n- No claims are made based on assumptions; all observations are based on code behavior.\n- The scores are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** Given the code's nature, a slightly higher score (around 0.2) is reasonable but not high, reflecting the general risk of network code but no specific issues.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.2** |\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard implementation of IMAP IDLE handling with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or critical vulnerabilities. The slight security risk reflects the general risks associated with socket programming but nothing specific.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the risk score should remain low.",
