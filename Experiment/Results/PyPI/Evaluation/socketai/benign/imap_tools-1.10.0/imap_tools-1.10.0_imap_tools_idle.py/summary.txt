  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward implementation of IMAP IDLE handling, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score is appropriate given its network communication role, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero."
