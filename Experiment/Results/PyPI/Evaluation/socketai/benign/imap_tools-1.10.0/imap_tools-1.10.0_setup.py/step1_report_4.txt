{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'imap-tools', used for packaging and distributing the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the package's __init__.py file to extract version information, reads the README.rst file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform network or file operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads package version from __init__.py -> uses it in setup() configuration; Reads README file -> supplies long_description in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. The code performs standard setup tasks without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files (__init__.py and README.rst) to gather metadata for packaging. The get_version() function extracts version info via regex, which is a common practice. The setup() call configures package details, including author info, license, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network access, or user input handling is present. The code does not contain any embedded or obfuscated code, nor does it perform any suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
