{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'imap_tools' Python package, primarily to read package version info, prepare metadata, and configure installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ variable from the package's __init__.py file, reading the README.rst file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or actions that could lead to data leakage, code injection, or other security issues are present.",
  "flows": "The version information is extracted from the package's __init__.py and used in the setup configuration; static files like README.rst are read for documentation purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version string from the package's __init__.py, which is a common practice. It reads a static README file for documentation. The setup configuration uses these inputs to prepare the package. No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for legitimate package configuration purposes.",
