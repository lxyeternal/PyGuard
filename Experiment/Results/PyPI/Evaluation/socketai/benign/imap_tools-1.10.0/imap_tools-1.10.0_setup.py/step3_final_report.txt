{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads version info and README for package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads from local __init__.py and README.rst files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs processed; no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from local file, uses it in setup; no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, performing file reads and invoking setuptools.setup() with static metadata. It does not process untrusted input, execute external commands, or perform network operations. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present. The regex extraction of version is safe, and the file reads are from local, controlled files. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is effectively 0, with a minor conservative note in some reports at 0.1, which is acceptable but unnecessary. Overall, the code is standard, safe, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores in the reports are accurate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The minor security risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat and is safe for use.",
