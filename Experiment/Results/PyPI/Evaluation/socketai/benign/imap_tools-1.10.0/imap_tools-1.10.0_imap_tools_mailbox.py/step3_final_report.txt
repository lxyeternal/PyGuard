{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard IMAP email client library supporting various connection modes (unencrypted, SSL, STARTTLS) and common email operations such as login, fetch, delete, copy, move, and flag management. It handles credentials and server interactions securely and follows best practices for error handling.",
  "sources": "Credentials provided during login/authentication; server responses during fetch, search, and command execution; message data during fetch and append operations.",
  "sinks": "IMAP server commands that transmit credentials, message data, flags, and commands; no untrusted data is processed or leaked locally.",
  "flows": "User credentials flow into login/authenticate commands; message criteria flow into search and fetch commands; message data flows from server responses into message objects; flag and command results flow back to the client for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard IMAP client implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code manages IMAP connections with multiple modes, performs authentication securely, and handles message operations with proper error checking. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The logic is clear, and security practices appear sound. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard IMAP client library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk is low, and the code is free of obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
