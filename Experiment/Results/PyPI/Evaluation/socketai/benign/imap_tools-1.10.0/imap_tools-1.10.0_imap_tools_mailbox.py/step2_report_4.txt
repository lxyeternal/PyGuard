  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code logic, potential security issues, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard IMAP client for email operations, with inputs like credentials, criteria, message data, and configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into IMAP commands; no insecure handling or injection points are evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code uses standard practices, with validation and error checking.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard email client code with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2 (low risk, typical for such code).\n\n**Assessment:** The logic is sound; no issues found. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard IMAP interactions, with secure handling of credentials and server commands. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Again, standard IMAP client functions, handling credentials, message operations, and server capabilities.\n- No malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scores, reflecting legitimate code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Similar analysis; standard IMAP operations, multiple connection modes, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code’s nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Same conclusion: standard IMAP client code, well-structured, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are 0, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly varied (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risks typical of email client code that handles credentials and server commands.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the nature of the code, which is a standard email client library.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports and scores are reasonable and aligned with the code’s actual behavior. No further adjustments are necessary.",
