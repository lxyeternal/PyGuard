  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard email operations via IMAP, including login, fetch, delete, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into commands; no suspicious handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a standard IMAP client implementation with proper validation, error handling, and support for multiple connection modes.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score is appropriate, and malware score is correctly zero. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard IMAP client functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Credentials and message data flow into IMAP commands; no malicious behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a conventional IMAP client, handling sensitive data correctly and following standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The low risk and malware scores are justified. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard email management functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Credentials and server responses flow into commands; no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code uses standard IMAP commands, handles errors properly, and supports multiple connection types.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate IMAP client, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements various connection modes and email operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** User inputs and server responses flow into commands; no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard IMAP client code, with proper error handling and security considerations.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, standard email operations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into IMAP commands; no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is a typical IMAP client, with no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low likelihood of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior or payloads are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable given the code's functionality, which involves handling sensitive data but no malicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** ~0.15 (low, due to handling of credentials and server interactions, but no malicious intent)\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, secure IMAP client library with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
