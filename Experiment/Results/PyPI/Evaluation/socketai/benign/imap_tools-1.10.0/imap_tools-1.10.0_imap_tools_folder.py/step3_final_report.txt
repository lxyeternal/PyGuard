{
  "purpose": "Provides IMAP folder management functions including listing, creating, deleting, renaming, and status retrieval of mailbox folders.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (folder names, options), server responses from IMAP commands",
  "sinks": "IMAP command execution, response parsing, potential data handling based on server responses",
  "flows": "Input parameters are encoded and sent via IMAP commands; server responses are parsed and processed into data structures",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; regex parsing is standard",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard IMAP folder operations with proper validation, encoding, and error handling. It uses regex for parsing server responses and encodes folder names to prevent injection issues. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The handling of untrusted input (folder names) is done via encoding and validation, mitigating typical risks. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with typical IMAP client implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented IMAP folder management module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to untrusted input handling, which is properly managed. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1.",
