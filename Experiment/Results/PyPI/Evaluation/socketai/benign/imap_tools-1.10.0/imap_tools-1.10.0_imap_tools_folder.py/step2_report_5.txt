  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard folder management via IMAP; data from user input and server responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** IMAP commands and response parsing; no untrusted data is written outside expected commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. Use of regex for parsing is routine.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior, straightforward implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the operations are standard and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar mailbox folder management, standard inputs and server responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Commands sent via _simple_command; responses parsed accordingly.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation. Regex usage is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; implementation appears typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is consistent. The very low security risk score aligns with the lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages folders with typical parameters; data flows into IMAP commands.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Encodes folder names, parses responses; no unsafe operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. Response parsing is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is valid. The slightly higher security risk score (0.2) is acceptable, considering the potential for user-supplied folder names to be crafted maliciously, but the code itself does not exhibit vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard folder operations, inputs from method parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data passed into commands; no untrusted code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors, obfuscation, or secrets. Regex parsing is routine.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, straightforward implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar folder management functions, standard data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs into IMAP commands; no external or malicious data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical, safe implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward nature. No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.1–0.2) reflect minimal potential concerns, mostly related to handling user-supplied folder names, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity or payload detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.1** (very low; standard folder management code with minimal risk)\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a well-structured, standard IMAP folder management implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws. The small security risk score accounts for potential misuse of user input but does not reflect actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.",
