  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard email utility functions with no malicious intent. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The functions perform typical parsing, validation, and formatting tasks. No suspicious behavior, no network activity, no obfuscation. The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature; perhaps it accounts for potential parsing errors or misconfigurations, but not maliciousness.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk score could be lowered to 0.1, considering the absence of any evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe parsing and encoding functions, with no malicious activity. Confidence is 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The functions are standard, with proper exception handling and validation. No network or malicious code. The security risk score is appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  The report's conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for email processing, with potential vulnerabilities in decoding inputs or handling user data. Malware score 0, security risk 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  While decoding and encoding functions can be points of concern if misused, the code appears to handle inputs carefully, with type checks and exception handling. No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The security risk score of 0.2 might be slightly conservative but acceptable given the potential for input manipulation.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  The conclusion is sound. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, with no malicious intent. Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and use standard practices. No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  The assessment is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with no malicious code, low security risk. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, security risk 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:**  \n  The functions are standard, with proper validation and exception handling. No network activity or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Verdict:**  \n  The conclusion is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly conservative but justifiable, considering input parsing and handling, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (standard utility functions with minimal risk, but cautious due to input handling)\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented set of email utility functions with no security threats or malicious intent.",
