{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes for parsing, decoding, and handling email messages and attachments, including extracting headers, body content, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Email headers, message parts, payloads, and attachments; data is read from email message objects and header fields.",
  "sinks": "Decoded header fields, payloads, and filenames; potential risk if malicious content is processed or executed later outside this code.",
  "flows": "Input email data → parsing headers and parts → decoding header fields and payloads → storing in class attributes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. Usage of regular expressions and decoding functions appears standard. No suspicious network calls or malicious actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically parses email message data, extracting headers, payloads, attachments, and metadata using standard libraries and decoding methods. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behaviors are evident. It primarily processes data for display or further handling. No input/output flows involve untrusted external systems beyond email processing, and no dangerous code injection or system access is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard email parsing library with no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It is designed for safe extraction of email components, with no evident security risks or malware indicators.",
