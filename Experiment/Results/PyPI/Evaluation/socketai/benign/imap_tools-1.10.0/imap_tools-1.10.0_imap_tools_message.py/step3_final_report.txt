{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse email messages, extract headers, content, attachments, and metadata safely using standard libraries and decoding routines.",
  "sources": "Email headers ('From', 'Subject', 'Date', etc.), message payloads, attachments, and fetch data parts such as raw message bytes, UID, and flags.",
  "sinks": "Decoded headers, payloads, and attachment data; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Fetch data → parsing with email.message_from_bytes → decoding headers and payloads → extracting attachments and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; use of regex and decoding functions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard email parsing operations, safely decoding headers, handling attachments, and extracting metadata without executing code or establishing network connections. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions and properties are implemented using well-known libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-implemented, standard email parsing utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and minimal security risk scores (~0.1) are justified. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
