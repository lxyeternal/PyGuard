{
  "purpose": "A command-line tool to identify deprecated NLTK functions and classes used in Python files and directories, providing warnings for such deprecated usages.",
  "sources": "Reads Python files (.py) and doctest/text files; reads in files during directory traversal.",
  "sinks": "Outputs warnings and formatted lines to terminal; reads files from disk; no network or external data transfer.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> tokenizes and scans for deprecated identifiers -> outputs warnings with context.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a custom TerminalController class for color formatting; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; employs deprecated regex for parsing strings, but not malicious; no obfuscated code present; no suspicious network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static analysis by walking through provided directories or files, identifying deprecated function/class definitions via regex matching, then scanning files/tokenized lines for uses of those deprecated identifiers. It outputs warnings with line context and highlights. The code uses standard libraries, regular expressions, file I/O, and tokenization. No malicious logic, external network calls, or hidden backdoors are present. The only potentially concerning aspect is the use of regex to parse code, but it is used solely for analysis and not for code execution or injection. Overall, the script functions as a safe static code analyzer with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static analysis tool designed for identifying deprecated NLTK components. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware signatures. It operates solely on local files and outputs warnings. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
