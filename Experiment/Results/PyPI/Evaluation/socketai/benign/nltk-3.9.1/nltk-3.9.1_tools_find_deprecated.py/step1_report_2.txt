  "purpose": "A command-line tool for finding deprecated NLTK functions and classes in Python files and directories, providing warnings and suggestions for replacements.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source files and directories; uses open() to read files; reads doctest examples; inspects directory structure.",
  "sinks": "Outputs warnings and formatted lines to the terminal; no data sinks that leak data or execute untrusted code detected.",
  "flows": "Reads source files -> parses tokens and searches for deprecated patterns -> prints warnings with line numbers and code snippets.",
  "anomalies": "Uses potentially unsafe open() calls without explicit file handling safeguards; relies on dynamic regex matching; no input validation beyond filename filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code scans Python files and directories for deprecated function and class definitions by parsing source code and regex matching. It identifies deprecated definitions using regex patterns and tracks their usage in the code. It utilizes tokenize to process source files and doctest examples, printing warnings with highlighted tokens. It imports standard libraries and third-party nltk modules, but does not execute or evaluate untrusted code. The script's operations are limited to static analysis and terminal output, with no network activity, file modification, or data exfiltration observed. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present. The primary functions are benign and intended for code maintenance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static analysis utility for identifying deprecated NLTK functions/classes in source code, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs source code parsing and pattern matching for deprecated elements, and outputs warnings. There is no evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. Its operations are limited to reading and analyzing source files and printing results, fitting its purpose as a developer tool.",
