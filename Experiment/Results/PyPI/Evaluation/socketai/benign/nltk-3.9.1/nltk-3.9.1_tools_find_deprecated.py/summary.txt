  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility for detecting deprecated NLTK functions/classes. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its benign, maintenance-focused purpose. The only minor concern is its reliance on legacy Python 2 modules, which does not impact security but suggests modernization for Python 3 compatibility."
