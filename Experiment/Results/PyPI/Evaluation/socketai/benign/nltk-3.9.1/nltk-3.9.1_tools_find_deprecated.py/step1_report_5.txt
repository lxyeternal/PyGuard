  "purpose": "A command-line tool designed to identify and warn about deprecated NLTK functions and classes in Python files and directories.",
  "sources": "Reads Python files (.py), doctest files (.doctest, .txt), and directories; inspects file content for deprecated definitions and usage.",
  "sinks": "Outputs warnings to terminal; no data sinks that leak or manipulate untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "Scans files for deprecated definitions, then tokenizes files to identify deprecated function/class usage, and prints warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated or non-standard modules such as 'cStringIO' (Python 2 compatibility); no evidence of malicious code or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution found. The code is straightforward and primarily for static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static analysis on Python files to find deprecated NLTK components. It uses regex to identify deprecated definitions, then tokenizes files to detect usage, and prints warnings with highlighted identifiers. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious system manipulations are present. The script relies on standard modules and does not include obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a legitimate tool intended for code maintenance and backward compatibility checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for identifying deprecated NLTK features, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely on file content, does not perform network or system harm, and has no hidden backdoors or malicious payloads.",
