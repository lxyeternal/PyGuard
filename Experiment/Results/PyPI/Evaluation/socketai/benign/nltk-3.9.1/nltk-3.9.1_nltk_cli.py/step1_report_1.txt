  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for tokenizing text using NLTK's word_tokenize, supporting parallel processing and various options.",
  "sources": "Reads input text streams via click.get_text_stream from stdin.",
  "sinks": "Outputs tokenized text to stdout; potential for data exposure if input contains sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input stream -> tokenization process (word_tokenize) -> output stream.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code observed. No evidence of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a CLI for text tokenization leveraging NLTK. It uses standard libraries and functions with configurable options for language, process count, encoding, and delimiter. It reads input from stdin and writes to stdout, which is typical for command-line tools. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are present. The use of parallel processing via 'parallelize_preprocess' appears safe and is part of normal multiprocessing workflows. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard, benign CLI tool for text tokenization with no malicious intent or behavior. It relies on standard libraries and does not contain suspicious or malicious code elements.",
