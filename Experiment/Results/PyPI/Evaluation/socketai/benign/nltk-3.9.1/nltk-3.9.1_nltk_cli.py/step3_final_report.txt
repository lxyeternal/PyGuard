  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool for tokenizing text streams using nltk.word_tokenize, supporting parallel processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input lines from stdin.",
  "sinks": "Outputs tokenized lines to stdout.",
  "flows": "Reads lines from stdin, processes each line with word_tokenize, joins tokens with specified delimiter, and writes to stdout; parallelizes processing if multiple processes are specified.",
  "anomalies": "Uses the same option flag '-l' for both '--language' and '--preserve-line', causing a conflict in argument parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility for text tokenization, employing standard libraries and parallel processing. No external network calls, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present. The duplicate '-l' option is a usability bug that could cause runtime errors but does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard text tokenization CLI tool with a minor usability bug related to conflicting option flags. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the argument flag conflict, which should be corrected for proper usability but does not impact security.",
