  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface for tokenizing text using NLTK's word_tokenize function, supporting multi-process processing and customizable options.",
  "sources": "Input streams from stdin, reading lines of text; command-line options for language, process count, encoding, delimiter.",
  "sinks": "Output stream to stdout, writing tokenized text; no untrusted data sinks that leak data or execute code.",
  "flows": "Input stream -> word_tokenize applied line-by-line or in parallel -> output stream with joined tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code patterns; standard use of third-party libraries. Parallel processing is used, but without dangerous operations.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a CLI to tokenize text using NLTK. It reads input lines from stdin with specified encoding, processes them either sequentially or in parallel, and outputs tokenized lines joined by a delimiter. No code injection, data exfiltration, or system disruption behaviors are present. The use of tqdm for progress indication is standard. The options are straightforward and safe. There are no hidden or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for tokenizing text with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard libraries and implements typical processing workflows without any suspicious code or behavior.",
