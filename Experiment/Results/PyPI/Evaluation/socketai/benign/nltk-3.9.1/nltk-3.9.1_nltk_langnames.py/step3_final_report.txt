{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to translate between language names and language codes, utilizing static dictionaries and external data from bcp47 and Wikidata.",
  "sources": "Reads language tags, names, and codes from function parameters, and loads external mappings via bcp47.load_wiki_q()",
  "sinks": "Uses internal dictionaries and external data for lookups; no external sinks or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "Function inputs (tags, names, qcodes) are processed through lookups and conversions; no untrusted data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; warnings are informational; data is static or explicitly loaded",
  "analysis": "The code relies on static data structures, explicit external data loading, and straightforward lookup functions. No network, file, or environment modifications occur. Warnings are benign, and no dynamic code execution or data exfiltration is present. The use of external data (bcp47, Wikidata) is controlled and loaded explicitly. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for language code translation with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the risk score should also be 0, reflecting the static, read-only nature of the code.",
