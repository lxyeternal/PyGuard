  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for language code translation with no malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the risk score should also be 0, reflecting the static, read-only nature of the code."
