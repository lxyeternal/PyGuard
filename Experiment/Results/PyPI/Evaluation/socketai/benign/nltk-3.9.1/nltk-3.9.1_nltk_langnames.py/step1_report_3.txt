{
  "purpose": "Provide functions to translate between language names, codes, and Wikidata Q-codes, including support for retired codes and ISO639 standards.",
  "sources": "Reads from external files via nltk.corpus.bcp47, user-provided input parameters, and internal dictionaries for language codes and names.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include functions that handle untrusted input (langname, langcode, lang2q, q2name) which could lead to incorrect mappings or information leakage if misused, but no direct data leak mechanisms are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings (language tags, names, Q-codes) are processed and mapped through dictionaries and functions, sometimes involving warnings and lookups in external dictionaries. No data flows directly to network or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'warn' extensively to handle unrecognized codes or names, which is not suspicious but indicates fallback behaviors. There is no evidence of code injection, network communication, or backdoors. No obfuscated or malicious logic is present. Use of regex is straightforward. The code relies on external data from nltk.corpus.bcp47, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are found.",
  "analysis": "The script defines multiple translation functions for language codes and names, with fallback to retired or missing entries, leveraging dictionaries. It includes mechanisms for inverse dictionary creation, with warnings for non-bijective mappings. The external resource 'nltk.corpus.bcp47' is loaded explicitly. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Warnings are used for handling unknown codes, which are benign. The code’s structure and logic are typical for a language code translation utility. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. The code operates solely on data processing without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard utility for language code translation, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly uses warnings and external dictionaries, with no indications of sabotage or malware. It maintains good practices in data handling and external resource management.",
