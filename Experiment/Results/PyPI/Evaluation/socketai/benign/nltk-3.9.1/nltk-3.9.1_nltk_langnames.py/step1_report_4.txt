{
  "purpose": "Provide functions for converting language names and codes between various standards, including BCP-47, ISO 639-3, and Wikidata Q-codes.",
  "sources": "User inputs in functions langname, langcode, lang2q, q2name, and tag2q; external library bcp47 data; internal dictionaries for language code mappings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe usage could involve input data being used in functions that output language codes or names, but no direct sink involves executing untrusted code or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data from user functions flows through regex validation and dictionary lookups, with warnings generated for unusual or retired codes, and mappings returned accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Use of warn() for unusual conditions is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of utility functions and static mappings for language code conversions. It uses regex for validation, dictionaries for lookups, and warns about non-bijective mappings or unrecognized inputs. It loads external data for Wikidata mappings explicitly. No indication of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions are straightforward and involve no system or network calls beyond dictionary lookups and warnings. The overall structure appears benign and consistent with language code conversion utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign language conversion utility module with no signs of malicious intent. It relies on external data loaded via a library, performs dictionary lookups, and issues warnings on inconsistent data mappings. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected.",
