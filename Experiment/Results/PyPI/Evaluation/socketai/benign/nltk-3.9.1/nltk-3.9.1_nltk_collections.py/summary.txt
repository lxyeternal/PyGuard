  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard NLP utility library with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor risk is the potential misuse of LazyMap with untrusted functions, which is a known, manageable concern. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, consistent with the analysis."
