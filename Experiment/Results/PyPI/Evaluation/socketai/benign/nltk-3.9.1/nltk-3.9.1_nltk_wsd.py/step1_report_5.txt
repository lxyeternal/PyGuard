  "purpose": "Provide a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm implementation using the Lesk method for use with NLTK's WordNet corpus.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'wordnet' corpus from the NLTK library.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (context_sentence, ambiguous_word, pos, synsets, lang) flow through the function to produce a synset based on overlap analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward, utilizing standard library functions and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for WSD using a classic algorithm. It imports a reputable library (NLTK), processes input parameters to filter synsets, and performs a set intersection to determine the most appropriate sense. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated logic is present. All operations are contained and align with typical NLP processing. The code does not handle sensitive data, credentials, or external inputs that could be malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. It strictly implements a known algorithm for lexical disambiguation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of the Lesk algorithm for WSD, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on standard NLP libraries and performs safe, well-defined operations. No security risks or malware are evident.",
