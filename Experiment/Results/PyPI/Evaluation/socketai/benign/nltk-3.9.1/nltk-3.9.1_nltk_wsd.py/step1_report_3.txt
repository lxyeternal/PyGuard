  "purpose": "Implement a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm using the Lesk method, utilizing the nltk WordNet corpus to identify the most likely sense of an ambiguous word in a given context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters: 'context_sentence', 'ambiguous_word', 'pos', 'synsets', and 'lang'. It also accesses external data via 'nltk.corpus.wordnet'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data, send data over a network, or access sensitive system resources. No sinks that could leak information or cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to filter synsets and compute the maximum overlap between context and synset definitions, leading to the selection of the most appropriate sense.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard nltk functions; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'lesk' for word sense disambiguation using the Lesk algorithm. It reads data from parameters and external nltk data ('wordnet'). It filters synsets based on POS if provided, then calculates the overlap between context words and synset definitions, returning the synset with the maximum overlap. The implementation is straightforward, standard, and does not include any suspicious or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a well-known algorithm for NLP purposes. It only accesses publicly available nltk data and does not perform any malicious activities or security-sensitive operations. There is no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
