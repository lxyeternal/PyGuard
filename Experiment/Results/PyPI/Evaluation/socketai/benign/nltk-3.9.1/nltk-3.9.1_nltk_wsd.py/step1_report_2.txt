  "purpose": "Implement the Lesk algorithm for Word Sense Disambiguation using the NLTK WordNet corpus.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the input parameter 'context_sentence', 'ambiguous_word', 'pos', and 'synsets'. Uses 'wordnet.synsets()' to retrieve synsets from the NLTK corpus.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes data to external systems, network, or files. No sensitive information handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to filter synsets; the maximum overlap score is computed to select the sense. No external data flow outside reading from in-memory variables and library calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code solely utilizes the NLTK library functions and standard Python constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for word sense disambiguation based on context overlap. It imports 'wordnet' from NLTK, which is a standard and safe library. The function filters synsets by POS if specified, retrieves synsets for the ambiguous word, and calculates the sense with the maximum overlap of context words and synset definitions. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code relies entirely on established, well-known libraries and functions, with no external network or file system interaction.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a linguistic algorithm utilizing the NLTK library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs natural language processing tasks safely within the scope of the library functions. No malicious or suspicious code elements are present.",
