{
  "purpose": "Provides a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm implementation based on the Lesk method, utilizing NLTK's WordNet corpus.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as context_sentence, ambiguous_word, pos, synsets, and lang; accesses nltk.corpus.wordnet to retrieve synsets and definitions.",
  "sinks": "Returns a synset object with the highest overlap score; no data leaks or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to filter and process synsets; the maximum overlap determines the sense; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified. The code is a standard NLP algorithm implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for word sense disambiguation using the Lesk algorithm, leveraging NLTK's WordNet corpus. It filters synsets based on optional POS and language parameters, computes overlaps between context words and synset definitions, and returns the sense with the maximum overlap. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious instructions are present. The code strictly performs linguistic processing without any side-effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a WSD algorithm utilizing the NLTK library and WordNet data. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, educational, or NLP utility function.",
