  "purpose": "Implement a Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) algorithm using the Lesk method, leveraging the NLTK WordNet corpus.",
  "sources": "Reads from the input parameter 'context_sentence' and calls 'nltk.corpus.wordnet.synsets()' to retrieve synsets.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is sent over the network, written to files, or otherwise exposed outside the process.",
  "flows": "Input 'context_sentence' and 'ambiguous_word' flow into the function, which then retrieves synsets, filters them, and computes the sense with maximum overlap.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of NLTK's WordNet API, no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports NLTK's WordNet corpus, defines a straightforward function implementing the Lesk WSD algorithm, and filters synsets based on POS if provided. It calculates the sense by maximizing overlap between context and synset definitions. There are no network operations, file operations, or other suspicious behaviors. Usage is purely for linguistic disambiguation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a well-known algorithm for word sense disambiguation using NLTK's WordNet corpus. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
