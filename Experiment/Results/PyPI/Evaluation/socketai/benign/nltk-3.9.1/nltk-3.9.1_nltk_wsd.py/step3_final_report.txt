  "purpose": "Implementation of the Lesk algorithm for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) using NLTK's WordNet corpus.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: context_sentence, ambiguous_word, optional pos, synsets, and lang; retrieves synsets from WordNet.",
  "sinks": "Returns the synset with the highest overlap; no external data sinks or leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input context and ambiguous word flow into synset filtering and overlap calculation, leading to selection of the best sense.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard NLP implementation with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard WSD task using the Lesk algorithm, relying solely on trusted libraries and in-memory data. It does not perform network operations, handle sensitive data, or execute dynamic code. All reviews agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The logic is clear, well-documented, and aligns with typical NLP practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of a well-known NLP algorithm. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The assigned scores in all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
