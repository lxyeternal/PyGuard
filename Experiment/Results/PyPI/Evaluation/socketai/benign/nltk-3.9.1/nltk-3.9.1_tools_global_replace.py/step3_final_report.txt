  "purpose": "Batch pattern replacement in files across directory trees, modifying file contents by substituting a specified pattern with a replacement string.",
  "sources": "Reads files in binary mode, decodes as UTF-8, and processes their content.",
  "sinks": "Writes modified content back to the same files, potentially overwriting sensitive data if patterns are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input patterns from command-line arguments flow into the update function, which reads files, performs replacements, and writes back.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling suppresses errors; permission modifications could be misused; no validation of pattern or replacement inputs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file content replacement with permission adjustments. It skips certain directories and handles files broadly. No network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. Exception handling is broad but not malicious. The code's behavior is benign, intended for utility purposes. Potential misuse exists if patterns are malicious, but this is inherent to such tools, not a flaw. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for batch pattern replacement with minimal security concerns. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified due to permission modifications and potential misuse if patterns are malicious. All reports correctly assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, with risk scores reflecting minimal threat. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate.",
