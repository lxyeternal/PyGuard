{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for representing, parsing, and manipulating context-free and feature-based grammars, primarily for NLP applications such as syntactic parsing and grammar transformations.",
  "sources": "Parsing input strings or files containing grammar definitions, regex-based parsing, loading external resources (e.g., corpora), and constructing data structures in memory.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks such as system commands, network calls, or file writes based on untrusted input; data is processed internally within the program.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed via regex and converted into class instances; no dynamic code execution or external command invocation occurs; data flows are limited to in-memory parsing and object creation.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns. Regex is used solely for syntax parsing, not for code injection or malicious exploitation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard NLP grammar library with class definitions for Nonterminal, Production, CFG, and related classes. Regex patterns are straightforward and used for syntactic parsing only. No eval, exec, or external system calls are present. Demo functions load external resources but do not execute untrusted code. The overall structure and logic are consistent with safe, well-established NLP tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured NLP utility library for grammar representation and parsing. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk beyond the minimal, typical risk associated with regex parsing of untrusted input, which is negligible here.",
