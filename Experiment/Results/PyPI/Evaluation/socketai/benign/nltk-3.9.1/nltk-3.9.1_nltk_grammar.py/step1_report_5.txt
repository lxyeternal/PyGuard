{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and functions for creating, manipulating, and reading various types of formal grammars used in natural language processing, such as CFGs, PCFGs, feature grammars, and dependency grammars.",
  "sources": "Code reads input strings for grammar definitions, dependency productions, and feature structures; it parses files and strings to create grammar objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks found that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or other malicious effects; code primarily constructs objects and performs parsing and validation.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed by regex and custom parsers; the resulting data structures (Nonterminals, Productions, Grammars) are constructed in memory without executing untrusted code or data transformation leading to harmful behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of regex for parsing is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are present. The code relies on external data (e.g., grammar strings) but does not evaluate or execute it.",
  "analysis": "The code includes classes for Nonterminal, Production, CFG, PCFG, and dependency grammars, with methods for parsing input strings into grammar objects. It uses regex for parsing grammar rules and supports reading from strings and files. No untrusted data execution, external command calls, or code injection mechanisms are present. All data processing is limited to validation, parsing, and object creation. No network activity, system calls, or external data leaks are observed. The code performs standard parsing and data structure management, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of grammar data structures and parsers for NLP tasks. It performs no malicious actions, no hidden backdoors, and no suspicious behaviors. It is safe for use from a security perspective.",
