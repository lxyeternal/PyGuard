{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for defining, parsing, and manipulating various types of formal grammars, such as CFGs, PCFGs, feature-based grammars, and dependency grammars, primarily for linguistic parsing and syntax analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings or files for grammar definitions, production rules, and dependency structures, especially in functions like read_grammar(), fromstring() methods, and demo functions that load data from external sources or strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the eval-like parsing functions (though they do not directly evaluate code), data returned to calling functions, and print statements. No direct code injection or unsafe data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into internal data structures; production rules flow from input parsing functions into grammar objects; data flows into various class constructors and methods; demonstrations load external resources or parse strings; output is mainly string representations or printed structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly implements grammar data structures and parsing logic. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution is evident. The only dynamic aspect is parsing strings and regex matching, which is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for Nonterminals, Productions, and various grammar types, with associated parsing functions that convert string representations into objects. The functions and classes are consistent with standard parsing and grammar representation practices. No code injection, external command execution, or unsafe data handling appears. The code uses regex for parsing but does not evaluate code or execute untrusted input beyond parsing. Demo functions load external grammar files or strings but do not execute untrusted code. All data handling appears limited to string parsing and data structure creation, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of grammar representation and parsing for linguistic analysis. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indications are present. It appears to be a safe, well-structured library module for grammar handling.",
