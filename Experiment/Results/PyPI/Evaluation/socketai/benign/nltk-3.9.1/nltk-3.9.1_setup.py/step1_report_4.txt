  "purpose": "Setup script for the NLTK Python package, responsible for configuration, dependency management, and installation details.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from a file, importing setup tools, defining dependencies, and registering CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks detected; no input/output vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reading version file -> configuring dependencies and setup parameters -> registering console scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the attempt to register 'mbcs' codec is a known workaround and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks including reading a version file, configuring optional dependencies, and defining entry points. The mbcs codec registration is a known workaround for platform-specific bugs, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. External requests or system modifications are absent. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured setup script without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for the NLTK package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected package setup tasks safely.",
