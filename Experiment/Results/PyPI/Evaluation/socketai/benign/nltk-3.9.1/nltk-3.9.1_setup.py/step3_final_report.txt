{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the Python package 'nltk', performing package metadata setup, dependency specification, and entry point registration.",
  "sources": "Reads local VERSION file, defines dependencies, and registers console scripts; no external untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data leaks; local file reading and package metadata setup only.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file; registers codecs workaround; defines dependencies and entry points; no external network or data flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "The codecs registration lambda is an unconventional workaround for a known bug, but it is a documented, benign fix.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious external data handling. The codecs workaround is a known compatibility fix, not malicious. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The console_scripts string formatting is slightly unconventional but harmless. The dependency and metadata definitions are typical for a well-maintained package.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The codecs workaround is a documented fix, not malicious. The overall security risk is negligible.",
