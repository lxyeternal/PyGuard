  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the NLTK Python package, defining installation parameters, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the VERSION file, importing standard libraries, and processing dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only reads local files and sets up package installation.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file -> sets up dependencies and entry points -> registers codecs -> configures package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, involving reading a version file, registering codecs, defining dependencies and metadata. No malicious logic, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. It only performs file I/O, package configuration, and registration of console scripts. No external inputs or untrusted data are processed at runtime, and no suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for the NLTK library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
