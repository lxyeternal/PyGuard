  "purpose": "The script sets up the NLTK Python package for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Reading the VERSION file; importing modules; registering codecs; accessing package metadata; defining dependencies and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of untrusted code if the VERSION file or input is tampered with; registration of custom codecs.",
  "flows": "Reading VERSION file -> importing modules -> registering codecs -> setup() function processing dependencies and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "The custom codecs registration with a lambda function is somewhat unusual but appears intended to handle MBCS bug workaround. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. It reads version info from a file, registers codecs as a workaround, and defines package metadata, dependencies, optional groups, and CLI commands. No external input besides the local VERSION file is used, and dependencies are standard. The codecs registration using a lambda is somewhat uncommon but not malicious; it is a known workaround for a Python bug. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The overall structure is typical for a setup.py script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious intent. The only unusual part is the codecs registration, which is a known workaround, not malicious. No malware or suspicious activity detected.",
