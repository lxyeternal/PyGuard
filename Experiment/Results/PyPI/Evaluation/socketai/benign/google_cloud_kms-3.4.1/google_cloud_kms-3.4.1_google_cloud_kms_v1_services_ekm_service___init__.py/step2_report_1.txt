  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports and exports classes related to a client for an External Key Manager (EKM) or similar service.\n   - The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements, an `__all__` declaration, and licensing comments.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or any suspicious behavior is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign maximum confidence (1 or 1.0) and zero scores for obfuscated code, malware, and security risk.\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The current scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity—no network calls, no code execution, no data leaks.\n   - The malware score should be 0, as correctly reflected in all reports.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as a benign module setup.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\nGiven the simplicity and standard nature of this module, there's no indication of malicious intent or security issues. The code appears to be a typical part of an SDK or client library setup.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The overall security posture is very low risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
