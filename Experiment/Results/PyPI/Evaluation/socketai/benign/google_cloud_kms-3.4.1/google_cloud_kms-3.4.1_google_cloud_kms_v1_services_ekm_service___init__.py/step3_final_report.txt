{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports and exposes specific client classes for an External Key Manager (EKM) service, facilitating their use in other parts of the SDK or application.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client). It does not process any input or external data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points; the code does not perform any data output, network activity, or dynamic execution.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static imports and the declaration of __all__, with no runtime data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package's __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module that imports specific classes and defines __all__ for export. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, or network activity. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate any malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign and straightforward nature of this code. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent or security issues. The current assessment and scores are accurate and should be maintained.",
