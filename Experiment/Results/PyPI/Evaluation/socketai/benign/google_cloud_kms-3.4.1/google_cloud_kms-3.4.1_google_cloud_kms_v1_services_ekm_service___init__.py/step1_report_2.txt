{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module imports and exports for an encryption key management service (EkmService).",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data or external input handling is visible.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements and module exports with licensing comments; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initializer that imports specific classes from local modules and defines what is exported. It contains only licensing comments, import statements, and __all__ definition. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code. The structure and content are typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export setup with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any actions beyond defining what symbols are available for import.",
