  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and defines `__all__`. No dynamic code, data handling, or external interactions.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0, which is consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Risk justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same as above, standard import/export module.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, matching the benign nature.\n- **Risk justification:** Correctly low scores.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Basic module setup.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Zero across malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- **Risk justification:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Simple class import/export.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n- **Risk justification:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Zero across the board.\n- **Risk justification:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code snippets in all reports are minimal, standard module initializers with no dynamic behavior, no data processing, and no external interactions.\n- The malware score is 0 in all cases, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as there's no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- Given the simplicity and transparency of the code, I would not adjust any scores.\n- My own estimate aligns with the provided scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
