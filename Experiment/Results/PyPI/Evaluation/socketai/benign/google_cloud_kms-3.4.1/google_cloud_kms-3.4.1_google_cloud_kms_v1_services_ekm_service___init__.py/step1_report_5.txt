  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for the EkmServiceClient and EkmServiceAsyncClient classes, likely for a Google Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .async_client and .client modules.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python module export.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initializer that imports specific classes and exposes them via __all__. It contains licensing information and standard Python import syntax. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. No data input, output, or runtime behavior is present that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module setup for a client library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
