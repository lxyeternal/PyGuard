{
  "purpose": "The code defines a registry for transport classes related to the EkmService, facilitating selection and management of different transport mechanisms (gRPC, async gRPC, REST). It also exports relevant classes and interceptors for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest), creation of an ordered dictionary (_transport_registry).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up class mappings and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for defining a transport registry.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes, sets up a registry dictionary mapping string keys to transport classes, and defines __all__ for module exports. No input reading, external data processing, or unsafe operations are present. The code appears to be standard infrastructure setup for a client library, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup for managing transport options in a client library. It contains no malicious, suspicious, or security-risk behavior. The code is benign and safe to use.",
