{
  "purpose": "The code defines a registry for different transport classes related to the EkmService, including gRPC, asyncio, and REST transports, and exposes certain classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest) and internal variable '_transport_registry' where transport classes are stored.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data exposure observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes a registry and exposes classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for a client library setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules related to transport mechanisms for a service. It constructs an ordered dictionary mapping transport names to their classes, which are imported from local modules. It then defines an __all__ list to specify exported classes. There are no dynamic code execution, network connections, or handling of untrusted data. The code is structured as a typical Python package component for transport registration, with licensing and copyright notices, and no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for registering and exposing transport classes in a client SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. No indications of malware or security issues are present.",
