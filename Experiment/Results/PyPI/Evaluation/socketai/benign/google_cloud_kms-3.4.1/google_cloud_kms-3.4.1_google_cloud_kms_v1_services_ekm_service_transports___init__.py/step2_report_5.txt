  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward module that registers transport classes for an SDK.\n- It only imports classes, creates a registry dictionary, and exports symbols.\n- No user input, external data, network communication, or dynamic execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate setup code typical for client libraries.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Standard registration of transport classes.\n- **Sources:** Import statements, dictionary, class registration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, no malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct), malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, registering transport classes.\n- **Sources:** Imports, dictionary creation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No anomalies, no malicious intent, boilerplate.\n- **Risk score:** 0, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, transport registry.\n- **Sources:** Imports, registry setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Risk score:** 0, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Imports, registry.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Sources:** Imports, registry.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0, malware 0, obfuscated 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard SDK setup code.\n- The risk scores are all appropriately zero.\n- The malware scores are zero, as no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscation is correctly identified as absent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign, boilerplate SDK component with no security concerns.",
