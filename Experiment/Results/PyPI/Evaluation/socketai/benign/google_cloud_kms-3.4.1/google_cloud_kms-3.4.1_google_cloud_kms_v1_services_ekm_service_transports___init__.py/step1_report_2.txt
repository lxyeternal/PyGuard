{
  "purpose": "The code defines and registers transport classes for an EKM service, including gRPC, asyncio, and REST transports, along with an interceptor.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (collections, typing), and local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest). No user input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks; no network or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up class references and a registry.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The code appears to be straightforward class registration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports necessary modules, creates an ordered dictionary to register transport types, and assigns string keys to corresponding transport classes. It concludes with defining the __all__ variable for exports. There are no dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module for registering transport classes for a service client. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and appears to be boilerplate setup code.",
