{
  "purpose": "This code registers transport classes for an SDK, mapping string identifiers to class types for transport mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Import statements for transport classes and the creation of an ordered dictionary to register these classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes, registers them in a dictionary, and exports symbols; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of import statements, a registry dictionary, and an __all__ declaration. It does not execute dynamic code, handle user input, or perform network communication. All imported classes are registered in an ordered dictionary with string keys, serving as a setup component for SDK transport mechanisms. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code aligns with standard SDK boilerplate, and the absence of suspicious patterns supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK setup component for registering transport classes. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and security risk: 0 are appropriate and justified.",
