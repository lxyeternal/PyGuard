  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK setup component registering transport classes.\n- No untrusted data, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate for client library infrastructure.\n\n**Confirmations about the code:**\n- The code does not process user input, external data, or perform any network operations.\n- It only imports classes and registers them in an ordered dictionary.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The licensing comments and import statements are standard.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n- The reasoning that the code is a standard SDK setup is sound.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code is purely registration logic with no malicious patterns, scores of zero are justified.\n- No elevated risk scores are necessary.\n\n**Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly avoid assumptions about future behavior; they only analyze static code.\n- No concerns about hidden malicious code are justified here.\n\n**Consistency:**\n- The scores align with the analysis; no inconsistencies detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is standard SDK boilerplate for registering transport classes. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The consistent analysis across all reports supports this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and overall security risk.",
