  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for EkmService in a Python client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dictionary initialization, and assignment of transport classes to registry.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or user input processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up class references.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard pattern for SDK transport registration, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports transport classes and registers them in an ordered dictionary for later use. It includes licensing comments and standard Python import syntax. No user input, network communication, or dynamic execution is present. The code structure is typical for SDK setup and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK setup component for registering transport implementations. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks identified.",
