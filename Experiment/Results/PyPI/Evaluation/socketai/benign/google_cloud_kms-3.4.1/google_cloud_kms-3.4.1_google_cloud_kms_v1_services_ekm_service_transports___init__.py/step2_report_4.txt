  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports consistently conclude that the code is a standard SDK setup component. They identify no malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious data flows. The code only imports classes, registers them in a dictionary, and exports them—nothing that indicates malicious intent.\n\n2. **Code Content and Logic:**  \n   The code is straightforward: it imports transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and defines `__all__` for exports. There are no dynamic code executions, no network operations, no user input handling, and no data processing involving untrusted sources.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**  \n   The code is purely infrastructural, serving as a registry for transport classes in a client SDK. It doesn't process untrusted data, doesn't perform network communication, and doesn't contain any logic that could be exploited.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, aligning with the analysis that there's no security concern.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**  \n   No. The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the detailed analysis. The confidence level is 1, indicating certainty.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**  \n   Since the code is standard SDK boilerplate, the risk of malicious behavior is negligible. The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**My Overall Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign SDK setup component. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and standard.  \n- No modifications needed to the reported scores.  \n- The reports' reasoning is sound and aligns with the code content.",
