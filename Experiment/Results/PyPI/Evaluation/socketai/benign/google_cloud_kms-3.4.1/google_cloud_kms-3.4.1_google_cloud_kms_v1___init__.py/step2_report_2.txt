  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward SDK module, primarily consisting of import statements, class/type definitions, and an `__all__` declaration. There are no indications of dynamic execution, data processing, or runtime logic that could be malicious. The code is purely declarative and standard for a client library setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of external data sources, network operations, or any suspicious constructs. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\nGiven the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nNone of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which aligns with the code's benign nature. Since the code is purely declarative, no elevated risk scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior. This is consistent with the code content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that the code is boilerplate, SDK setup, and contains no suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured SDK module with no runtime logic, data processing, or network operations. It contains no secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns. All evidence points to a benign, purely declarative module intended for client use.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the nature of the code.",
