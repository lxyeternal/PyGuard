{
  "purpose": "This code is a module that provides client interfaces, data types, and constants for interacting with Google Cloud's Key Management Service (KMS) and related services.",
  "sources": "The code imports version info from google.cloud.kms_v1 and various classes and functions from local package modules (.services, .types, etc.). No external input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or lead to potential leaks or malicious actions. The code primarily defines and exports classes and constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not perform runtime data processing or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard SDK interface definition, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. It is purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK module with imports, type definitions, and an __all__ declaration for exported objects. It does not include any executable logic, input handling, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is well-structured, following conventional patterns for client library modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign SDK module for Google Cloud KMS. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, nor does it perform any runtime actions or data processing that could be malicious. It is safe and purely declarative.",
