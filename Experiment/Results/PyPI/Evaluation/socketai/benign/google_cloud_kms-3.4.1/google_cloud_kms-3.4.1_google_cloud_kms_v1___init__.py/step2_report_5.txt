  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard SDK module for Google Cloud KMS.\n- They emphasize that the code only performs static imports, exports, and defines constants/classes.\n- No runtime data processing, network operations, or external data handling are reported.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, which aligns with their analysis.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any executable logic beyond import/export statements.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate or auto-generated SDK setup code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and comprehensive; no contradictions or suspicious claims are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate; the code is clear and standard.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is a typical, safe SDK module with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, boilerplate SDK module for Google Cloud KMS, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify its safe and standard nature.",
