  "purpose": "This code serves as a client SDK module for Google Cloud KMS, providing import statements, type definitions, and an __all__ list for public API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.kms_v1 and local service/type modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and export declarations only.",
  "flows": "N/A – no runtime data flow or external data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, embedded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static SDK module comprising import statements, type definitions, and an __all__ list. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with its benign, declarative nature. The high confidence score (1) reflects the static analysis and standard structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK module with no malicious intent or security issues. It is purely declarative, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safe status.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
