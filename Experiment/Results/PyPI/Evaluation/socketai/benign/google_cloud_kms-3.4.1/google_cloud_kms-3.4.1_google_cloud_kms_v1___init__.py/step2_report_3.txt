  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK module, primarily consisting of import statements, type definitions, and an __all__ export list.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or runtime data processing are present.\n- No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, or dynamic execution patterns are identified.\n- The code is licensed under Apache 2.0, with no signs of embedded secrets or malicious code.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: to provide client interfaces and data types for Google Cloud KMS and related services.\n\n**Specific issues:**\n- The code does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or external input processing.\n- There are no apparent vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- The \"malware\" scores assigned are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code structure.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (not explicitly stated but implied), which is justified since the code is purely declarative and SDK setup.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- None of the reports suggest any suspicious activity or logic flaws.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the confidence level is 1 across all reports.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, benign SDK module with no malicious intent.\n- The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, standard SDK boilerplate, with no malicious or security concern indicators.",
