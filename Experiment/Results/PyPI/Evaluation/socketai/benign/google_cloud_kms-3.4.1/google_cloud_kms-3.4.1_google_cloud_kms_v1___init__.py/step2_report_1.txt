  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK module, primarily consisting of import statements, type definitions, and an __all__ list for public API exposure.\n- No external input, runtime data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code does not contain any embedded secrets, obfuscated segments, or suspicious constructs.\n- The license comments and structure follow standard SDK patterns.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities is detected.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is also 0, consistent with the code being clear and declarative.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting a high certainty based on the static analysis.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n- The reports do not identify any actual issues or flaws in the code.\n- They correctly recognize that the code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic that could be malicious.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Summary of My Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign SDK module for Google Cloud KMS.\n- It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky components.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n- The high confidence scores are justified given the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nBased on the provided reports and my analysis, I concur with their assessments. The code is safe, and no adjustments to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
