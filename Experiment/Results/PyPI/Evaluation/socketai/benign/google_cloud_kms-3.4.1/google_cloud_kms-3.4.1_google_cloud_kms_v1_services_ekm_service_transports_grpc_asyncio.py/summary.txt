  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK transport layer with no signs of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of pickle in debug logs, which should be replaced with safer serialization methods to prevent potential data leaks. Overall, the code is safe and standard, with minor logging-related security considerations."
