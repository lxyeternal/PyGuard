{
  "purpose": "The code defines pagination classes for iterating through Google Cloud KMS EKM connections responses, both synchronously and asynchronously, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the initial request objects and response objects; potential source of untrusted data if request objects are externally provided.",
  "sinks": "Uses method calls that process response data; does not appear to send untrusted data elsewhere or leak information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request objects through API method calls, responses are processed and paged, with iteration over response fields; no external data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code constructs. Use of try-except for attribute handling is standard; no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code provides iterator classes for paginating API responses. It imports necessary modules and defines classes with clear responsibilities. The code interacts solely with the Google Cloud KMS API, handling pagination logic. No external input is processed in a harmful manner, nor are there any network connections, data leaks, or backdoors. The structure appears standard and intended for normal SDK usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard pagination utility classes for Google Cloud SDK, with no signs of malicious or maliciously intended behavior. It safely wraps API responses to facilitate iteration. No malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks detected.",
