  "purpose": "Classes providing synchronous and asynchronous pagination over Google Cloud KMS EKM connection responses, managing API requests, responses, and pagination tokens.",
  "sources": "API response objects, request objects, and method call parameters during class initialization and iteration.",
  "sinks": "API response data, request parameters, and pagination tokens; no untrusted data processed directly.",
  "flows": "Request objects and method calls produce responses; responses' next_page_token triggers subsequent requests; iteration yields EkmConnection objects from responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; standard SDK pagination pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard pagination classes for Google Cloud KMS API, handling request/response management, retries, and iteration. It does not execute external commands, process untrusted input maliciously, or contain obfuscation. The logic is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a utility for API response iteration. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pagination utility for Google Cloud KMS EKM connections, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk scores are justified given its role and implementation.",
