{
  "purpose": "This code provides pagination classes for iterating through EKM connections in Google Cloud KMS API responses, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and request parameters during class initialization and during page requests; it does not read external input directly.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write or transmit untrusted data; it mainly manages API request and response data.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves constructing requests, invoking API methods, and iterating over response data (ekm_connections). There is no evident untrusted data source flowing into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code appears standard for a pagination utility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for paginating through API responses, handling both synchronous and asynchronous operations. It safely manages request objects, response objects, and retry configurations. The usage of API method calls and response iteration follows expected patterns. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The code refrains from executing any external commands, handling untrusted input insecurely, or accessing sensitive environment variables. It does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured pagination utility for Google Cloud KMS EKM connection listings. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided snippet. Its purpose is solely to facilitate safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
