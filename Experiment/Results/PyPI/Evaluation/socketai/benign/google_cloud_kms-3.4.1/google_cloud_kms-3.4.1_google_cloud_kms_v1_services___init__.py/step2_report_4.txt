  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of comments with licensing and copyright information.\n   - There are no executable statements, data flows, input/output handling, or dynamic code.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n2. **Code Verification:**\n   - The code is purely a license header; no issues are present in the code itself.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessments, uniformly indicating no security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is just comments, there is no reason to assign any higher risk scores.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code snippet is a standard license header with no executable code, data handling, or malicious content.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThis code is benign, and the scores should remain at zero across all categories. No further action or concern is necessary.",
