{
  "purpose": "The code sets up the packaging configuration for the google-cloud-kms Python library, including reading version info, dependencies, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'gapic_version.py' and reading 'README.rst' file; importing standard libraries (io, os, re) and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink points like network, file, or environment variable modifications that could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file; loads readme content; uses setuptools to configure package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py structure. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: extracting version info via regex, reading the long description, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. It uses secure standard library functions and well-known packages. No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior present. The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It properly manages dependencies and package metadata without involving any risky operations.",
