{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, specifically the 'google-cloud-kms' library, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'gapic_version.py', reads 'README.rst' for long description, and gathers namespace packages using setuptools.find_namespace_packages()",
  "sinks": "No data flows into untrusted sinks; package setup parameters are static or derived from local files. No network or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Version info extraction from local file -> setup configuration; package discovery -> setup configuration; no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Code appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads version data from a file, reads the README for documentation, and sets up package metadata and dependencies. It uses standard setuptools functions and regular expressions to parse version info. All operations are local file reads or package configuration without executing untrusted code or network activity. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for Python package distribution. The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
