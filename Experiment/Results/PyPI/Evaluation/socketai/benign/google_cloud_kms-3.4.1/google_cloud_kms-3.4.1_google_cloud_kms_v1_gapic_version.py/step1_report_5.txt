  "purpose": "Metadata and licensing information for a Python package, including version and license details.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading beyond static comments and variables).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data processing or output).",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; code only defines metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of license and copyright comments is standard; no anomalies observed. The version string is static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single version variable assignment. There are no functions, input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. This appears to be a typical header for a Python source file, indicating licensing and versioning information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
