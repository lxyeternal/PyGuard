  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code is only license comments and a version string, with no executable logic.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, security risk scores:** All zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is only metadata.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, only license comments and a version variable.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; only static comments and version string.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; only metadata.\n- **Scores:** All zero, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n- The code snippets are purely static license headers and version declarations.\n- No executable code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is accurate given the content.\n- The security risk score is also correctly at 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, standard license and version headers with no security concerns.",
