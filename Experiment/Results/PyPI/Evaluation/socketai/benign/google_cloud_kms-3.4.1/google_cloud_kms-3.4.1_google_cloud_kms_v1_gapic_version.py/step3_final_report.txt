  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version declaration for a Python package, providing metadata without executable logic.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = \"3.4.1\") and license comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks; the code contains only static comments and a variable assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist, as the code is purely static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard license and version header with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a version string assignment, with no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify its benign nature. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, reflecting the absence of malicious or obfuscated content. The code's purpose is purely informational, and there are no signs of security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license header and version declaration with no security or malicious concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
