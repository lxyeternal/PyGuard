{
  "purpose": "Wrapper to start protoc, a Protocol Buffers compiler.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'protoc' module and call to 'protoc.exec_protoc()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'protoc.exec_protoc()' which may invoke an external process.",
  "flows": "Import 'protoc' -> call 'protoc.exec_protoc()' which likely runs external compilation process.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward invocation of an external tool. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'protoc' module and calls its 'exec_protoc()' method. 'protoc' is typically the Protocol Buffers compiler, used for code generation. The call likely executes the compiler, which is a standard operation. No user input, environment variables, or data sources are evident. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and appears to be a simple wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign wrapper to invoke the Protocol Buffers compiler. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
