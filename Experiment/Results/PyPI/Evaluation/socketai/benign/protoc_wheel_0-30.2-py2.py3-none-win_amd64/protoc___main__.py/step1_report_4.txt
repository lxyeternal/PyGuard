{
  "purpose": "Wrapper to start protoc, likely for protocol buffer compilation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'protoc' module; invocation of 'protoc.exec_protoc()'.",
  "sinks": "Function call 'protoc.exec_protoc()' which could execute external code or commands.",
  "flows": "Import of 'protoc' module -> call to 'protoc.exec_protoc()' which may execute code within the 'protoc' module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward, relying on an external library's functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'protoc' module and immediately calls 'exec_protoc()'. Without additional context, this appears to trigger the protocol buffer compilation process, which is standard behavior for such scripts. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual activity are present. The function may execute system commands depending on 'protoc' implementation, but this is typical for protocol buffer compilation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper that initiates protoc compilation. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on this snippet. It appears to be a legitimate utility script.",
