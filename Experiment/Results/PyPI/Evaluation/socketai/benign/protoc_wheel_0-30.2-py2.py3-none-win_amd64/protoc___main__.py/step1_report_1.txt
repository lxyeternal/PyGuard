  "purpose": "Wrapper to start protoc",
  "sources": "Importing 'protoc' module and calling 'protoc.exec_protoc()'",
  "sinks": "The call to 'protoc.exec_protoc()' which executes a method from an imported module",
  "flows": "Import of 'protoc' -> execution of 'protoc.exec_protoc()'",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code directly calls a method from an imported module without additional context or validation",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'protoc' module and executes its 'exec_protoc()' function. This function likely triggers the Protocol Buffer compilation process or similar build step. There are no hardcoded credentials, user input, or data flows that could lead to data leakage. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior. Without knowledge of what 'protoc.exec_protoc()' does internally, it appears to be a standard invocation of a build or compilation process. No malicious activity is evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper that invokes a function from the 'protoc' module to start a process, likely related to Protocol Buffers. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
