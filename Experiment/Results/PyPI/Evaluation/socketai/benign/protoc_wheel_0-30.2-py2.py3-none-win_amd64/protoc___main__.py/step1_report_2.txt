  "flows": "Import protoc -> call protoc.exec_protoc() -> potential code execution or system command execution",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code is straightforward. The main concern is the use of protoc.exec_protoc(), which may execute external processes depending on protoc implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'protoc' module and calls its 'exec_protoc()' function. There is no input reading or data handling beyond the import and function call. The code's purpose is to trigger protoc, likely the Protocol Buffers compiler, programmatically. Since 'protoc' is a third-party tool, its use is not inherently suspicious. However, if 'protoc.exec_protoc()' executes system commands or compiles code without validation, it could be exploited if the protoc module is malicious or compromised. The code is minimal and appears benign, but the security implications depend on the behavior of 'protoc.exec_protoc()'.",
  "conclusion": "The script's intent is to run the protoc compiler, which is typical for code generation tasks. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident. The primary risk is if the 'protoc' module or its 'exec_protoc()' method has malicious behavior or executes untrusted commands. Overall, the code itself is not malicious but relies on the trustworthiness of the 'protoc' module.",
