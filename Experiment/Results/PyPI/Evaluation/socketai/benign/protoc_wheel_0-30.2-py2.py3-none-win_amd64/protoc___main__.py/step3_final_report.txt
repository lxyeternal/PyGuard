{
  "purpose": "Wrapper to invoke the protoc compiler or build process",
  "sources": "Import of 'protoc' module, call to 'protoc.exec_protoc()'",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of external commands within 'exec_protoc()' depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import 'protoc' -> call 'protoc.exec_protoc()' -> external process execution (if any)",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and function call, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'protoc' and immediately calls 'exec_protoc()'. The behavior depends entirely on the internal implementation of 'exec_protoc()'. No user input, secrets, or data flows are present. The code is minimal and standard for a build wrapper. The primary security concern is whether 'exec_protoc()' executes untrusted code or commands. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity. The risk score varies between 0.1 and 0.3, reflecting cautiousness about external process execution but is justified given the minimal code and typical use case. The obfuscated score is 0, indicating clear code. Overall, the code appears benign, with the main trust dependency on the 'protoc' module and its 'exec_protoc()' method.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign wrapper invoking a build or compilation process. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The security risk hinges on the trustworthiness of the 'protoc' module and the behavior of 'exec_protoc()'. Given the current information, the code is safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
