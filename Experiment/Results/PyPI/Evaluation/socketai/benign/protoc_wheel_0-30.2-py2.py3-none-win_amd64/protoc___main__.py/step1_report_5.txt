  "purpose": "Wrapper script to start protoc compiler",
  "sources": "Import statement for protoc module, call to protoc.exec_protoc()",
  "sinks": "The call to protoc.exec_protoc() is a sink that executes an external process",
  "flows": "Import protoc -> call protoc.exec_protoc() -> external protoc process execution",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal and straightforward, but the execution of protoc.exec_protoc() without any validation or parameter control could be risky if protoc.exec_protoc() accepts untrusted input",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'protoc' and immediately calls its 'exec_protoc()' method. Since 'protoc' is a third-party or custom module, without additional context, it's unclear what 'exec_protoc()' does. If 'exec_protoc()' executes the Protocol Buffers compiler, it may invoke external processes, which can be benign or malicious depending on implementation and usage. The script itself does not process user input or perform any other operations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present. The code is minimal and appears to be a straightforward wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple wrapper that calls a protoc compiler execution. While the code itself does not contain malicious logic, the execution of protoc.exec_protoc() could be risky if it runs external processes with untrusted input. Overall, the script appears benign but warrants caution if protoc.exec_protoc() handles untrusted data or if the protoc module is untrusted.",
