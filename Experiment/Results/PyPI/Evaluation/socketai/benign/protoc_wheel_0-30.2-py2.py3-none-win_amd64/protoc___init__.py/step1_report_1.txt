  "purpose": "Wrapper script to execute the Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc) with specified arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, file paths (__file__), and sys.argv for input data.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.execv to replace the current process with protoc executable, passing command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "sys.argv (source) -> exec_protoc() -> os.execv() (sink) with PROTOC_EXE and arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code dynamically constructs paths and executes an external program without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up file paths for the protoc executable based on OS, and defines a function to run protoc with provided arguments. It uses standard library functions for path handling and process execution. There are no indications of malicious payloads, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only potential concern is that it blindly executes an external binary (protoc) with provided arguments, but this is typical for wrapper scripts. No obfuscated code, no suspicious logic, and no malicious side-effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for executing protoc, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. The only risk is if the protoc executable itself is compromised externally, but that is outside the scope of this code review.",
