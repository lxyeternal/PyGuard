{
  "purpose": "Wrapper to start the protoc compiler, providing paths and executing it.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, current file directory, and sys.argv for input data.",
  "sinks": "os.execv call with PROTOC_EXE and argv, which executes the protoc binary.",
  "flows": "Inputs from environment, file system, and command line flow into the execution call that runs the protoc binary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. The code simply wraps and executes an external binary.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up paths to a protoc binary depending on the OS and provides a function to execute it with provided arguments. It reads configuration from the file system and command line but does not process untrusted data beyond executing an external command. The execution of an external process is standard for such wrappers, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code does not contain obfuscated logic, hidden behaviors, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate wrapper around the protoc compiler with no malicious intent or malicious behavior detected. It securely executes an external process with user-provided arguments, assuming the binary itself is safe.",
