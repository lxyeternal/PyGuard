  "conclusion": "The code is a testing framework executing setup scripts dynamically, which poses inherent security risks if files are malicious. No active malicious payloads are present, and the malware score remains at 0 in controlled environments. The security risk score should be adjusted based on trust assumptions, with higher scores (up to 0.75) justified in untrusted contexts. The current scores are appropriate given the code's capabilities and context."
