  "purpose": "A minimal interface module that re-exports build functions and errors from setuptools.build_meta for use in PEP 517 build systems.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'setuptools.build_meta' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external interactions",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration; no data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward re-export with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions and exceptions from 'setuptools.build_meta' and exposes them via __all__, serving as a simple interface layer. It contains no data processing, user input, network activity, or file system operations. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and reliance on a trusted library indicate a benign purpose. All reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward re-export module providing build functions from setuptools. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores and assessments are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
