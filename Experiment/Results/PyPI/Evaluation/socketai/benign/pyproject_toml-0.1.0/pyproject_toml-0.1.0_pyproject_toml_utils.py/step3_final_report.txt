  "purpose": "A simple utility function to replace underscores with hyphens in a string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'field' passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "Return statement output; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'field' flows directly into the replace method, producing the output string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string replacement with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic string replacement using Python's built-in replace method. It has no external dependencies, no data leaks, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The function is deterministic, simple, and safe. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and full confidence in this assessment. No issues or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward string manipulation function with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores and analysis are accurate and consistent across all reports.",
