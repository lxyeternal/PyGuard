  "purpose": "Convert underscores to hyphens in a given string.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'field' (a string), received from function caller.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the transformed string.",
  "flows": "Input 'field' -> replace method -> output string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward string replacement.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a string input and returns a new string with all underscores replaced by hyphens. It uses the built-in 'replace' method, which is safe and does not involve any external data sources, environment variables, or untrusted inputs beyond the function parameter. No code injection, malicious logic, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code is minimal and standard for string manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility function for string replacement with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
