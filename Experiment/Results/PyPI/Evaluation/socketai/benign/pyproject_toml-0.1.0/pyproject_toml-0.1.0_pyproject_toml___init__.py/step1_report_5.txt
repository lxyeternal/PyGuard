  "purpose": "The code is designed to enhance and customize the setup process for Python packages by reading and processing 'pyproject.toml' files, and modifying setup arguments accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'pyproject.toml' file on disk, including project metadata, build system info, and tool-specific configurations.",
  "sinks": "Modifies arguments passed to 'setuptools.setup()' based on data read from the file; also prints the parsed TOML content.",
  "flows": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' -> validates and extracts metadata -> modifies setup parameters -> calls original setup function.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'print(pyproject_toml)', which could expose internal project data during execution. No other suspicious code patterns or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally reads 'pyproject.toml' for package configuration, modifies setup arguments accordingly, and handles various metadata fields with care. No indications of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms. The print statement could leak information during setup but does not constitute malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate setup customization by reading package metadata from a local configuration file. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The only minor concern is the 'print' statement which could leak internal data during execution but is not malicious.",
