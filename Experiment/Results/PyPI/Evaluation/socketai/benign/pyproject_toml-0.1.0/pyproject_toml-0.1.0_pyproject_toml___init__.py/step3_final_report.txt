{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the setup process by reading 'pyproject.toml' and related files to populate package metadata and handle README/license files.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml', README, and license files; accesses environment and filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Potential leakage via 'print(pyproject_toml)' if logs are exposed; no other data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads 'pyproject_toml' -> processes metadata -> prints data (debug) -> modifies setup args.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'print(pyproject_toml)' for debugging; raises NotImplementedError for license handling; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration files and modifies setup parameters, with a debug print statement that could leak internal data if logs are exposed. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The print statement is typical for debugging and not malicious. The license handling raises a NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete implementation but not security risk. Overall, the code is straightforward and follows standard practices, with minimal security concern primarily about info leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup utility with no malicious intent. The only concern is the debug print statement, which could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
