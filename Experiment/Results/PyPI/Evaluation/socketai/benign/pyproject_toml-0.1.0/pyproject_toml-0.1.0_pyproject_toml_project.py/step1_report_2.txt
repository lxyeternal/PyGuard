{
  "purpose": "Define data models for project metadata validation and serialization in Python, using Pydantic for schema enforcement.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, standard libraries (re, typing), third-party packages (packaging, pydantic), local utils module, class attributes, and validation methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe pattern matching on version strings; no direct sinks like network or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data (e.g., project metadata fields) through Pydantic models, with validation and aliasing, but no external or untrusted data manipulation or sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic validation in 'validate_license' method; the method raises ValidationError if certain conditions are not met, but this is standard validation logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed. No code execution, injection, or malicious data leaks identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data model definitions for project metadata with validation rules, including patterns for name and version fields. The use of Pydantic models and validators appears standard. The only custom validation checks the presence of 'version' if 'dynamic' does not include 'version'. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation techniques are present. There are no signs of malware, malicious code, or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a schema for project metadata validation with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard and safe in the context of a dependency's source code. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
