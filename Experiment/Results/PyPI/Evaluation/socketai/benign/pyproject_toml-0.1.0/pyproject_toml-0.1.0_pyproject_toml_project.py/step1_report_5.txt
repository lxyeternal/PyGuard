  "purpose": "Define data models for Python project metadata, including validation and structure for package information.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party libraries (packaging, pydantic), and a local utils module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is being written to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "Data validation and structure enforcement flow; no external data flows or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several data classes with validation rules, primarily for project metadata. It uses Pydantic models for validation and typing for data structure. No external data input or untrusted data handling is present. The license validation function checks for a missing version field, which is a standard validation pattern. No signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical data schema definition for package metadata with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs validation and data structure setup for project info. No malicious or security concerns identified.",
