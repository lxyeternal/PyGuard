  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model for build system metadata with validation rules for backend paths.",
  "sources": "import statements, class attributes, method decorators, validation logic",
  "sinks": "Validation errors raised for invalid paths, potential exception handling if used improperly",
  "flows": "Input data to class instantiation -> validation methods -> exception raising on invalid data",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom validator with potential for exception raising, but no malicious or suspicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data model using Pydantic for build system metadata. It validates that paths in 'backend_path' are relative and do not contain '..'. The validation logic is standard and aims to prevent directory traversal. No external data sources, network operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The custom validator is used properly. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are detected. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for data validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data model with validation logic for directory paths. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware. It serves to enforce path correctness in build system metadata. No security threats are identified.",
