  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic model for build system metadata with validation rules.",
  "sources": "The class BuildSystemMetadata reads data for 'requires', 'build-backend', and 'backend-path' from input data to validate and instantiate the model.",
  "sinks": "ValidationError raises for invalid paths; no sinks for untrusted data that lead to external effects or leaks.",
  "flows": "Input data is fed into the model; validation checks 'backend_path' for relative paths and absence of '..'.",
  "anomalies": "Uses Pydantic's model_validator with mode='after' to enforce path constraints. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data model with validation for directory paths, ensuring they are relative and do not contain parent directory references. No external network access, no code injection, or malicious data handling. Validation errors are used only for input correctness, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard model definition for validation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It ensures safe path inputs for build configurations. No security risks or malicious behavior detected.",
