  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up a Python package named 'http3_client' with versioning controlled by a 'version' file, and specifies dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'version' file to determine current version; writes to the same file to increment version number.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'version' file; no external or network data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'version' file to get current version -> writes incremented version back to 'version' file -> uses version in package setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code increments a version number stored in a local file, which is a common practice for versioning, but no validation or security checks are present; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script opens and reads a local 'version' file to determine the current version, incrementing it and writing back to the same file. The setup function uses this version for package metadata. No external data is fetched, and no network operations or code injection are present. The version management approach is simple but does not involve any suspicious or malicious behavior. The code appears legitimate for a build script, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script that manages package versioning via a local file. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for typical package version control.",
