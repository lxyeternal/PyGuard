  "sinks": "File write operation to 'version' file.",
  "flows": "Read 'version' file -> increment version -> write new version to 'version' file -> setup configuration with version info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a bare except clause, which suppresses errors; potential for version file manipulation, but no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a 'version' file to determine the current package version, increments it, and writes it back to the same file, then sets up the package using setuptools with the computed version. The process appears intended for version management. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The exception handling is broad but not malicious. The code does not perform any external network calls or data leaks. It only manipulates a local file for version control. Overall, the code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management script for packaging. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious.",
