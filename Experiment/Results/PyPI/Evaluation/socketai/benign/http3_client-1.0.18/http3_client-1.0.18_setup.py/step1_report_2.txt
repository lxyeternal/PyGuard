  "purpose": "Automates package setup and version management for a Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads from and writes to a local file named 'version'.",
  "sinks": "Writes to the 'version' file; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads the 'version' number, increments it, and writes it back to the same file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a broad exception clause without specifying exception types; no validation of 'version' data; reads and writes 'version' file directly without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version number from a local file 'version', defaults to 1 if reading fails, then increments and rewrites the version. The setup function configures the package with a dynamic version based on this number. The code does not include any external data sources, network communication, or suspicious code. The broad exception handling could hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The logic is simple version management for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management script with basic file handling for package versioning. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The broad exception handling is a potential code quality concern but not malicious.",
