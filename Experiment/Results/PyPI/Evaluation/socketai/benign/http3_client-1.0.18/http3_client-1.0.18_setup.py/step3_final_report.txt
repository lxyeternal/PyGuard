  "purpose": "Manage package versioning by reading, incrementing, and writing a local 'version' file during setup.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'version' file, writing to 'version' file",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; local file operations only",
  "flows": "Read 'version' -> increment -> write back -> use in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except:' clause hiding errors; no validation of version data",
  "analysis": "The code reads a 'version' number from a file, defaults to 1 if reading fails, increments it, and writes it back. It then uses this version in the setup() call. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The broad exception handling suppresses errors, which could hide bugs but is not malicious. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, benign version management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor concern about broad exception handling does not elevate the security risk significantly. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
