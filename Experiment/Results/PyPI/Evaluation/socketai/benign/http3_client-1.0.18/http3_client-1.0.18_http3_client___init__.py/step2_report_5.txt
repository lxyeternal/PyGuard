  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom requests import *\nfrom . import main\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code only contains import statements. No functions, data flows, or active behavior are present.  \n- The use of `from requests import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious.  \n- The relative import of `main` is standard in package structures.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes**\n\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide imported functions and complicate static analysis.  \n- No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities in this snippet alone.  \n- No data flows, sinks, or data processing points are present.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores and suggest changes**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- Security risk scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which seems appropriate given the minimal code.  \n- Confidence scores vary but are generally moderate, reflecting the limited context.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- None of the reports justify higher risk scores; the code is minimal and does not perform any operations.  \n- The use of `import *` could be risky if the module is compromised, but on its own, it is not enough to elevate the risk score.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\n- Since there's no active code, network activity, or data manipulation, the malware score remains at 0.  \n- If later code uses `requests` to send data or perform malicious actions, that would increase the malware score, but this is not indicated here.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior.  \n- The assumption that wildcard imports are suspicious is valid but not sufficient to classify as malicious.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the minimal, non-malicious nature of the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to poor practice of `import *`, but not dangerous)\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\nGiven the limited snippet, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a very low security concern, primarily due to coding style rather than malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no active behavior or data flows. The primary concern is coding practice, not security risk. The scores should remain low, with no adjustments necessary.",
