  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no active behavior or malicious code. The use of 'import *' is a coding practice concern but not a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the minimal and non-malicious nature of the code."
