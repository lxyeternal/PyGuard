  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Code:** `from requests import *; from . import main`\n- **Findings:** Only import statements; no execution or data flow.\n- **Concerns:** Use of wildcard import ('import *') can be risky, potentially hiding malicious functions if the module was compromised.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign on its own. The wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Code:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** Only import statements; no active behavior.\n- **Concerns:** Similar to report 1, the wildcard import is discouraged.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity present.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Code:** Same import pattern.\n- **Findings:** Only import statements; no active code.\n- **Concerns:** Wildcard import can hinder static analysis but is not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Code:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** Only import statements.\n- **Concerns:** Use of 'import *' from 'requests' could facilitate network activity if functions are called later.\n- **Assessment:** No active code, so no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Code:** Same import pattern.\n- **Findings:** Only import statements.\n- **Concerns:** Similar to previous, potential for network activity if functions are used later.\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the snippets contain actual code executing network requests, data handling, or malicious functions. They are purely import statements.\n- **Use of Wildcard Imports:** The main concern is the use of 'from requests import *', which can obscure which functions are used and complicate static analysis. However, this alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** All reports appropriately assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). These are consistent with the minimal code shown.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Since no actual behavior is demonstrated, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0, given the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Remains low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the minimal and benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.**",
