{
  "purpose": "The code imports the requests library and a local module named main, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading the requests library and the local main module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or network activity occurs here.",
  "flows": "No active code or data flow; only import statements without execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from requests import *' is discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no functions, data processing, or network activity. The wildcard import from requests can hinder static analysis but does not execute any malicious behavior on its own. The relative import of main is standard in package structures. Given the minimal and benign nature of this snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no active behavior or malicious code. The use of 'import *' is a coding practice concern but not a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the minimal and non-malicious nature of the code.",
