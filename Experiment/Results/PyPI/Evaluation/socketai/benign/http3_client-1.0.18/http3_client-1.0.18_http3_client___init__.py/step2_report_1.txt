  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom requests import *\nfrom . import main\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- The code only contains import statements.\n- No functions, data flows, or network activity are present in this snippet.\n- The use of `from requests import *` is generally discouraged because it pollutes the namespace, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- The relative import of `main` is standard in package structures.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Import requests and main.  \n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that no malicious activity is visible. The concern about `import *` is noted but not malicious.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — seems reasonable given the minimal code.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, likely similar reasoning.  \n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes no active behavior, only imports.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, appropriate.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same import pattern.  \n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning, minimal code, no malicious activity.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — consistent with others.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same import pattern, potential for network activity later.  \n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that no active code or malicious behavior is demonstrated here.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — seems reasonable.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with potential future network activity.  \n- **Analysis:** Correct that no active logic is present.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only import statements with no active malicious behavior.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious; the risk scores reflect that.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is accurate given the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the potential for misuse if the imported modules are used maliciously later, but not malicious in this snippet.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed unless future code shows active behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the snippet and the reports, I agree with the current scores. The code is benign in isolation, and the concerns are about coding practices rather than malicious intent.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (to account for the potential misuse in a larger context)\n\nThis conservative approach aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
