{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'requests' library and a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statements (requests, local module 'main')",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable with only imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from requests import *' can be considered insecure as it imports all functions into the global namespace, potentially hiding malicious or unintended functions. Importing a local module 'main' is common but could be suspicious if it contains malicious code; however, this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which alone do not perform any malicious actions. The use of 'from requests import *' could hide malicious functions if the module was altered, but on its own, it is not malicious. The local import 'main' is standard in modular code but warrants review in context. No data flows or security-sensitive operations are visible here.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet by itself does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. However, the use of wildcard imports ('import *') can be a concern if the module is compromised or used maliciously elsewhere. Based solely on this, the risk level is low.",
