  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippet, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom requests import *\nfrom . import main\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code only contains import statements; no functions, data flows, or active behavior.\n- Use of `from requests import *` is discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious.\n- Relative import of `main` is typical in package structures.\n- No signs of data leakage, network activity, or malicious code in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Importing `requests` and `main`; low risk; wildcard import concern.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is reasonable. The wildcard import could pose static analysis challenges but does not indicate malicious intent. The risk score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same import pattern; no active code; low risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly notes that the code is minimal and safe; the risk score aligns with the lack of active behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same import pattern; minimal code; concerns about `import *`.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments; no malicious activity evident.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same import pattern; potential for network activity if functions are used later.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; without further code, no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same import pattern; no active logic; potential risks depend on later code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the snippet alone is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low (0.1-0.2), which aligns with the minimal code and no active behavior.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — the main concern is the use of `import *`, which hampers static analysis but is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code snippet.\n- No modifications needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n- The scores are justified given the minimal, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign; the scores reflect the minimal risk, and the use of wildcard import is noted but not malicious.
