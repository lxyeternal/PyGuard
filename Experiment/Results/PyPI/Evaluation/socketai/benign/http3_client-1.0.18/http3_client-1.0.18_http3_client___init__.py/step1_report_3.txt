  "purpose": "Import all functions and objects from the 'requests' library and the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statements are the sources; they read external libraries and local modules.",
  "sinks": "No data is being processed or sent within this snippet; potential sinks are not present here.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible within this small snippet; no source-to-sink flow is established.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from requests import *' can be considered a risky practice as it imports all functions into the namespace, potentially masking malicious or unintended functions, but this alone isn't malicious. The relative import of 'main' is normal in package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from the 'requests' library, which could be used later for network operations, and imports a local module 'main'. There is no active code or behavior demonstrated here that indicates malicious intent. The use of wildcard import may complicate static analysis but does not directly imply malicious behavior. The snippet is minimal and lacks any operations or data handling that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is very minimal, only performing imports without any active behavior. It does not contain malware, suspicious activity, or security risks by itself. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hinder static analysis but is not malicious.",
