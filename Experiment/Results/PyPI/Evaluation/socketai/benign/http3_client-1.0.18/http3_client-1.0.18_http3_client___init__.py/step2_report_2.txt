  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  The code only has import statements; no malicious actions are present. The use of `from requests import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws in reasoning?**  \n  The report correctly notes the potential concern with wildcard imports but rightly concludes the risk is low. No significant flaws.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, justified)  \n  These seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same as above; only import statements, no active behavior.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The report appropriately states the minimal risk and discourages wildcard imports but recognizes they are not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (very low, justified)  \n  Looks consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Again, only imports, no active code. No malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Correctly points out the potential issues with wildcard imports but finds no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (moderate for wildcard import concern)  \n  Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same as previous; no code execution, just imports.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Properly notes that without further code, no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same; only import statements.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  Correctly states that no active logic is present, and risks are minimal.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n  Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is limited to import statements, with no active malicious behavior or data flows.\n\n- The main concern across all is the use of `from requests import *`, which is discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n\n- The malware scores are all appropriately zero, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n- The risk scores are low, aligning with the minimal nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (due to use of wildcard import, which hampers static analysis but isn't malicious itself)\n\n**Final justification:**  \nThe code snippet is benign, consisting solely of import statements. While the wildcard import is discouraged and can complicate static analysis, it does not constitute a security threat on its own. No data flows, network activity, or code execution are visible here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores are appropriate given the limited context.
