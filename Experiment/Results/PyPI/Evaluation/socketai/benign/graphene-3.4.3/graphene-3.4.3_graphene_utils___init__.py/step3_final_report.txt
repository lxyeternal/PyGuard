{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data, environment variables, or function arguments, typical of utility scripts.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output or network connections, but none are suspicious or malicious in this context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to outputs; no malicious or suspicious flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. The scores reflect a low security concern, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0.2, justified by the benign description. Confidence is high due to the lack of suspicious patterns and the consistent assessments across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score should remain at 0. The overall assessment indicates a safe dependency with minimal security concern.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
