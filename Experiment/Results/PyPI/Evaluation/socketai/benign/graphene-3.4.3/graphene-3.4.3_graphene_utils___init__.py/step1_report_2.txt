  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python package or script, potentially for general utility or application logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function arguments, and possibly external modules or libraries.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to files, makes network requests, executes system commands, or processes sensitive data which could be exploited if untrusted input is involved.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources (e.g., environment variables, function parameters) flow into processing functions and then into output or sink functions such as network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. No use of suspicious or obscure language features or obfuscation. No unusual network addresses or behaviors are evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. There is no clear malicious intent or backdoor code.",
  "analysis": "The code seems to implement typical functionality without evident malicious patterns. It does use standard libraries and follows conventional control flows. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are apparent. The presence of environmental variable reads and function calls appears typical for a legitimate application. Without further context or hidden payloads, the code does not show signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign, and no suspicious activities are evident.",
