  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic Python script that performs input handling and possibly some processing or output based on the data received.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from user input functions or external data sources (such as files, network, environment variables).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to console, writing to files, or network transmission of data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input) through processing functions to sinks (output or storage).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features observed.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows standard input handling, data processing, and output. No signs of malicious behavior such as system manipulation, network communications to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code does not contain dangerous patterns like executing untrusted code, leaking environment variables, or making insecure database queries.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, following standard programming practices.",
