{
  "purpose": "De-duplicate or normalize nested data structures by avoiding processing nodes with the same '__typename' and 'id'.",
  "sources": "Reads input data 'node' and its nested fields; accesses 'id' and '__typename' keys; iterates over 'node' fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; the code processes data internally without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Reads 'node' -> Checks for '__typename' and 'id' -> Uses cache key -> Recursively processes nested lists, tuples, or mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward recursive deduplication logic; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a recursive function that processes nested data, caching processed nodes based on their '__typename' and 'id' to prevent duplicates. It handles lists, tuples, and mappings appropriately, returning a cleaned or normalized structure. The logic is clear, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports provided are empty, indicating no detected issues or vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any network, file, or external system interactions, nor does it contain suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deduplication routine with no evidence of malicious activity or security flaws. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal. The code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
