  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard async DataLoader, no issues.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow; just futures and cache.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — aligns well.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with emphasis on potential risk via `batch_load_fn`.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Highlights that `batch_load_fn` could be malicious if untrusted.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns; standard asyncio usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes that `batch_load_fn` is user-supplied, which is a trust boundary concern but not a code issue.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable, given the dependency on external function.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious code detected; the risk score appropriately reflects trust issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same pattern; potential concern if `batch_load_fn` is malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid, emphasizes that the code itself is standard, with the primary concern being the trustworthiness of `batch_load_fn`.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior, risk score appropriately cautious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same pattern; external `batch_load_fn` could be malicious.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid, highlights the trust boundary.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid, emphasizes that code is standard and safe assuming trusted `batch_load_fn`.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the description; no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the trust boundary on `batch_load_fn`. This is appropriate because the core code is safe, but external functions could be malicious if untrusted.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (accounts for external dependency trust boundary)\n\n**Justification:** The code is a standard, well-structured async data loader. The only potential security concern lies in the user-provided `batch_load_fn`, which is outside the scope of static code analysis. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimate |\n|----------------|----------------|\n| Malware        | 0              |\n| Obfuscated     | 0              |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2            |\n\nThe overall assessment indicates a secure, legitimate implementation with a minor trust boundary concern, which is appropriately reflected in the risk score.",
