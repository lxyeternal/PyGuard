  "purpose": "Utility to recursively flatten nested data structures into a list of unique values, avoiding duplicates via JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are nested structures (lists, tuples, dicts) processed in-memory; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; in-memory processing only, no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Values are serialized with json.dumps, checked against an index to prevent duplicates, and stored in a list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward serialization and deduplication logic, no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs in-memory recursive flattening of nested data, serializing each element to JSON for deduplication. It does not access external systems, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscation. The use of json.dumps is standard and safe here. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident, and the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for data normalization with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
