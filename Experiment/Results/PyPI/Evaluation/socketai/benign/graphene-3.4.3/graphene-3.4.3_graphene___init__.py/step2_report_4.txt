  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely for importing modules, setting version info, and exporting symbols. No data flows, sinks, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — benign package initialization.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard package setup. No untrusted data handling or dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, possibly due to the general nature of package initialization.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard module setup with no signs of malicious activity. The call to `get_version()` is typical and controlled.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; no suspicious behavior or data flows.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, likely due to the pattern of static imports.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, standard package module setup.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Justification:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports. The code is purely for organizing and exporting components, with no dynamic execution, external data fetching, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The slightly elevated security risk scores (~0.1) seem to be due to the general pattern of package initialization, not actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is acceptable, given the context; no actual security risk is present.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code is a standard, benign module setup for a GraphQL utility package. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and does not pose any supply chain security threat.",
