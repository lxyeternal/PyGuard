{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that exports various GraphQL-related utilities, types, and functions for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from imported modules: .pyutils.version, .relay, .types, .utils.module_loading, and .utils.resolve_only_args. It also calls get_version() to retrieve version information.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data leakage could occur. The code primarily defines and exports constants and functions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules, setting version info, and exporting symbols. No untrusted data input flows or data processing pathways are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward, focusing on module imports and exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components from internal modules and assigns version information. It then constructs an __all__ list for public API exports. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated parts, or potentially malicious patterns. The get_version function is called with a static version tuple; assuming it is a normal utility, it does not pose risks. The imported modules are standard for GraphQL utility packages and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions as an exporter of GraphQL-related classes, functions, and version info. It contains no suspicious or malicious code and appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger codebase.",
