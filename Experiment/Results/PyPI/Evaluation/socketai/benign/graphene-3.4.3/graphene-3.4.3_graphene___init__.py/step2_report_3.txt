  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward package initialization or module setup for a GraphQL utility library.\n- No untrusted data flows, external data fetching, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The get_version function is called with a static version tuple, likely a benign utility.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code primarily exports constants, classes, and functions, with no evident malicious behavior.\n\n**Confirmations and Checks:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input or contain sinks such as network or file operations.\n- The import statements are standard, and the __all__ list correctly exposes public API components.\n- The get_version function's implementation isn't shown, but its usage appears typical and safe.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n- There are no apparent issues in the code logic or structure.\n- The reports do not identify any vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.\n- The only minor point is the call to get_version, but it seems to be a controlled utility, not executing untrusted code.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation or code hiding techniques are used.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, around 0.1, reflecting that this is a benign module setup with minimal security concerns.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured module initializer for a GraphQL utility package.\n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reported scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My Expert Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (very low, as it’s just a package setup)\n\n**Final Remarks:**\nThis code appears entirely benign. The consistent absence of suspicious patterns, dynamic behaviors, or external data handling indicates no security threats from this component.\n\n**Summary:**\n- Confirmed: No malicious or suspicious code.\n- Scores: Appropriate; no changes needed.\n- Overall security risk: negligible.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis on other parts of the supply chain is required.",
