{
  "purpose": "This module appears to be a collection of imports and version setup for a GraphQL-related Python package, organizing various types, utilities, and global IDs.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from local modules such as .pyutils.version, .relay, .types, and utility functions from .utils.module_loading and .utils.resolve_only_args.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any evident sinks such as network operations, file writes, environment variable usage, or data outputs that could leak untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing and defining versioning information, then exposing selected classes, functions, and constants via __all__ for external use. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are observed. The version string and get_version call are standard; lazy_import and resolve_only_args are utility functions without malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles imports and module exports, setting up the package's namespace. The get_version function is called with a static version tuple, which is standard for versioning. All elements are typical for a Python package focused on GraphQL utilities. No suspicious code, external data fetching, or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions mainly to organize and expose module components. Based on the provided content, it is safe.",
