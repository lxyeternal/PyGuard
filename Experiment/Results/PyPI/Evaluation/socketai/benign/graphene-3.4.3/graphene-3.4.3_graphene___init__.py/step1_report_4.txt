{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package defining GraphQL schema types, utility functions, and version information for a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.pyutils, .relay, .types, .utils.module_loading, .utils.resolve_only_args) and the get_version function call.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input directly; it mainly defines classes, constants, and imports functions. No sinks for data leakage or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows involving untrusted data; the flow is mainly static imports and version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs. The get_version function's implementation is not shown, but its use here is standard. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module initialization script for a Python package. It imports various components, assigns version info, and defines __all__ for exports. No external data inputs, command execution, or insecure operations are evident. The code relies on other modules, but nothing indicates malicious intent or malicious behaviors within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package module setup with no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
