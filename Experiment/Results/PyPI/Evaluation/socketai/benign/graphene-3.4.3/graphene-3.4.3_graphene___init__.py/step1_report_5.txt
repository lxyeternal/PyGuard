{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module imports and versioning for a Python package, likely related to GraphQL or schema definitions, with no evident runtime behavior or data processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules such as .pyutils.version, .relay, .types, .utils.module_loading, and .utils.resolve_only_args. No external input sources are directly used within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are explicitly present; the code mainly sets up imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily initializes module components and assigns version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. The get_version function usage is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various components necessary for a larger package, sets a version tuple, and exports identifiers via __all__. All imported modules seem standard for schema and utility functions. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations are present. The structure and content are typical for a package's __init__.py or module setup file, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script that sets up imports and versioning information. It does not contain malicious code, security risks, or obfuscated elements. The overall security risk is negligible.",
