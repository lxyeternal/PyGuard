{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing various GraphQL utility modules, setting version information, and defining the public API exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, get_version() call with a predefined version tuple",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or data sinks are present",
  "flows": "Imports and version assignment are static; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward structure",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, version setup, and an __all__ list for exports. There is no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or user input handling. The get_version() function is called with a static tuple, likely a benign utility. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.1) are consistent with this benign, standard package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for a GraphQL utility library. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious activity, and is free from obfuscation or vulnerabilities. The low malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate and justified.",
