{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports various modules and classes related to a GraphQL implementation, including types, connections, and utilities, for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.pyutils.version, .relay, .types, .utils.module_loading, .utils.resolve_only_args). Calls to get_version(VERSION).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, network communication, or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Importing modules and retrieving version information do not involve untrusted data flows; the code simply organizes and exports components.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic execution or code evaluation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, constant definitions, and an export list (__all__). It retrieves version info via a function call but does not process untrusted input or execute code dynamically. The structure is standard for a package's __init__.py, aimed at organizing and exposing internal modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only notable point is the call to get_version, which appears to be a controlled function retrieving version info, not executing untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard package initialization file that exports various classes and functions for a larger library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
