{
  "purpose": "Define a metaclass and a subclass that automatically handle 'Meta' options, including processing meta information during class creation.",
  "sources": "Reads class attributes (__name__, __dict__, and 'Meta' attribute), uses getattr, isinstance, and super to access class metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and attribute access flow, especially during class creation (__init_subclass__).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no backdoors or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass 'SubclassWithMeta_Meta' that customizes string representation of classes and a subclass 'SubclassWithMeta' that automatically processes a nested 'Meta' class or dict during subclassing. It raises an exception if 'Meta' is neither a class nor dict, and enforces constraints for abstract classes. The code uses standard Python features and class metadata handling without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate class and metaclass implementation for managing class metadata. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
