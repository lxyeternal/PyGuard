{
  "purpose": "Define a metaclass and a subclass that enhances __init_subclass__ to automatically process meta options, particularly handling a 'Meta' inner class or dict for configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class attribute 'Meta', calls the 'props' function on classes, and uses class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leak points are present. No untrusted data is transmitted or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Meta class or dict -> props() or attribute reading -> options dictionary -> __init_subclass__ logic",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'props' function suggests dynamic property extraction; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident. The class structure and method calls appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass and a class that manages meta information via a 'Meta' inner class or dictionary. It processes options during subclassing, with validation to ensure 'Meta' is either a class or dict. There are no data leaks, network communications, or suspicious code constructs. The use of 'props' and class attributes is typical for meta-programming. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage is found. The code appears to be an advanced Python pattern for class meta-data management, with no harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard meta-programming pattern for handling class metadata, with no malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues detected. It mainly processes class attributes and options during subclassing without external or unsafe operations.",
