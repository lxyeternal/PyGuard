{
  "purpose": "This code defines a metaclass and base class to manage class metadata via a 'Meta' attribute, enabling automatic property extraction and validation during subclassing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'Meta' attribute from subclasses, and the 'props' function applied to 'Meta' classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external data access, or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "The source is the 'Meta' attribute; the flow involves extracting properties via 'props' and processing options during class creation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations detected. The use of 'delattr' is standard for cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python meta-programming techniques to manage class metadata, including validation and property extraction. It does not perform any external data access, network activity, or obfuscation. The pattern is common for configuring classes with 'Meta' inner classes or dicts. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is readable, well-structured, and adheres to typical practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for class metadata management, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (~0.1). The reports' assessments are consistent with this analysis.",
