{
  "purpose": "This code defines a metaclass and a base class to facilitate meta-options handling in subclasses, mainly for class configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Code reads class attributes, especially 'Meta', and uses the 'props' function to process meta classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data processing, network operations, or file writes are found.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mainly internal attribute handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The use of 'props' and dynamic class attribute manipulation is standard for meta-programming.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass 'SubclassWithMeta_Meta' that customizes class string representations and tracks a '_meta' attribute. The 'SubclassWithMeta' class uses this metaclass and enhances '__init_subclass__' to process 'Meta' attributes, either as a dict or class, and passes options up the inheritance chain. No network, file, or system modification code is present. The structure and logic are consistent with meta-programming patterns in Python, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a meta-programming pattern for class options management. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe based on this analysis.",
