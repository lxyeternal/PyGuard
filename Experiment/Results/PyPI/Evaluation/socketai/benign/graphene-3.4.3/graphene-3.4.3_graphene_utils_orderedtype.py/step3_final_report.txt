{
  "purpose": "Defines an OrderedType class that assigns a sequential creation counter to instances for ordering and hashing purposes.",
  "sources": "Class variable creation_counter, instance initialization, gen_counter method, reset_counter method.",
  "sinks": "Comparison operators (__eq__, __lt__, __gt__), __hash__ method.",
  "flows": "Instance creation calls gen_counter, which updates class-level creation_counter; instances store their own creation_counter; comparison and hash functions use this value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple ordered object class based on a class-wide counter, with comparison and hashing based on this counter. It contains no external data input/output, network activity, or malicious logic. The methods are standard, and the design is typical for such utility classes. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is benign, and the logic is clear and predictable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for maintaining order among objects based on creation sequence. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
