  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code is a standard setup script.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is sound; no untrusted data or malicious operations. The use of regex and `ast.literal_eval` is safe. No obfuscation or malware signals.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard setup tasks. Slightly less confident (0.95).\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code or malicious activity. The dynamic import of `get_version` is common in versioning workflows.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment; the code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Notes the dynamic import of `pyutils.version.get_version` as a potential concern, but considers it standard.\n- **Assessment:** The only slight concern is the dynamic import, which could be malicious if the module is compromised. However, in a typical setup, this is common.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — slightly elevated risk due to dynamic import, but still low.\n\n**Justification for risk score:** Since the import could be manipulated if the external module is malicious, assigning a small risk score (0.2) is reasonable. No malware signals are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; no malicious code, just standard setup logic.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. The use of try-except and safe evaluation methods are appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — suitable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Highlights the potential risk of evaluating version info from files and dynamic import, but considers it standard practice.\n- **Assessment:** The dynamic evaluation could be risky if source files are tampered with, but this is common in package versioning workflows.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports agree on 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly elevated (0.2) in some reports due to dynamic import and evaluation, but these are standard practices and not inherently malicious.\n\n### **My Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — due to reliance on external modules and dynamic evaluation, which could be exploited if source files are compromised, but overall low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent. The only minor concern relates to external dependencies and dynamic evaluation, which are common in such scripts but should be maintained securely.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2             |\n\nProceed accordingly, with no immediate security concerns.",
