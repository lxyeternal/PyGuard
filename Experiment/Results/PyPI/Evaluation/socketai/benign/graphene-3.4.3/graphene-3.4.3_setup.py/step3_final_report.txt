{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'graphene' Python package, handling version retrieval, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'graphene/__init__.py'; reads README.md; imports 'get_version' from 'pyutils.version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; version info is read and passed to setup(); no network or file operations that could leak data.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file, evaluates it with 'ast.literal_eval', optionally imports 'get_version' to modify version string, then proceeds with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ast.literal_eval' is safe; dynamic import of 'pyutils.version' is common but could be exploited if the module is malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script. It safely reads version info, handles exceptions, and imports versioning utilities dynamically. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only minor concern is the dynamic import and evaluation, which depend on trusted sources. Overall, the code exhibits standard practices with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The slight potential risk stems from dynamic import and version evaluation, which are common in package management but should be secured via supply chain controls. The overall security posture is very good.",
