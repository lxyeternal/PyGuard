{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically retrieves properties of an object that are not part of the classes _OldClass and _NewClass.",
  "sources": "The function props(x) reads attributes of the object x via dir(x), vars(x), and getattr(x, key).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leak points are present; the code only accesses object attributes.",
  "flows": "The function gathers attributes from the object x that are not defined in the two classes, returning a dictionary of these attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dir() combined with vars() and getattr() to extract object properties dynamically, which is standard; no suspicious or obfuscated code present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes and creates a set of attribute names from both classes. The function props(x) retrieves attributes of an object x that are not part of these classes by filtering dir(x). It then constructs a dictionary of these attributes and their current values using vars() or getattr(). The approach is typical for dynamic attribute inspection. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The code appears to be a utility for introspecting objects, possibly for debugging or property listing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting object attributes excluding those inherited from two specific classes. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
