{
  "purpose": "The code defines two classes and a function to extract properties from an instance, filtering out attributes inherited from the specified classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, the dir() outputs, and the instance's vars() and getattr() functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The function 'props' gathers attribute data from an object 'x' by filtering out inherited attributes, effectively creating a property dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a set of known class attributes to filter out inherited attributes, but the purpose of this filtering is not inherently malicious or suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes, then creates a set of all attributes from both classes. The 'props' function returns a dictionary of attributes from an object 'x' that are not part of the inherited attribute set, using vars() and getattr(). This pattern is a common way to extract custom properties or attributes from an object, filtering out inherited attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, injection, or obfuscation. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive information handling are present. Overall, the code appears to be a utility function for property extraction without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting non-inherited properties from an object. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity are evident.",
