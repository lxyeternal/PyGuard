{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two classes and a function to extract properties of an object that are not part of the classes' existing attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, class attribute directories via dir(), and object attributes via vars() and getattr().",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit sinks that process untrusted data, nor does it perform any I/O, network communication, or data manipulation that could lead to leaks or harm.",
  "flows": "The function props() extracts attributes from an object x that are not part of the combined attribute sets of _OldClass and _NewClass, effectively listing 'custom' or 'additional' attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious constructs are evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines two classes with no content, then creates a set _all_vars containing the union of dir() outputs from both classes. The function props(x) filters attributes of an object x to include only those not present in _all_vars. This is a standard way to identify 'extra' properties on an object beyond class-defined attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code operates solely on class and object attributes, with no external data or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility to extract additional properties from objects by excluding class attributes. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
