  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n- Defines two classes `_OldClass` and `_NewClass` (empty).\n- Creates `_all_vars` as the union of `dir()` outputs of both classes.\n- Defines `props(x)` which returns a dict of attributes of `x` that are *not* in `_all_vars`, using `vars(x)` and `getattr()`.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- Finds no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign utility for extracting extra properties.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The report is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is for introspection, benign, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correct. The code is a utility, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Notes potential exposure of sensitive data due to attribute access.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and security risk (0.1).\n- Emphasizes that the code could expose internal or sensitive attributes but finds no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Valid point: the function `props()` could reveal sensitive info if the object `x` contains such data.\n- The code itself doesn't perform malicious actions, but in some contexts, exposing object attributes could be risky.\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)\n- Security risk: 0.1 is reasonable, considering potential data exposure.\n- Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- Confidence: 0.9 is appropriate given the cautious note.\n\n**Score adjustment:**\n- No change needed; the assessment aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing that the code filters out inherited attributes to get custom properties.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correct. The code is a benign utility.\n- The slight security concern is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Reiterates the same understanding: dynamic attribute retrieval, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Valid. The code is a utility for introspection, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Score suggestions:**\n- Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, utility-style introspection.\n- The only nuanced point is the potential exposure of sensitive data via `props()`. This is not malicious but could be a security concern depending on context.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for data exposure, I would assign a **0.2** to reflect that in some contexts, exposing object attributes might be risky, but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward utility for extracting object properties, excluding class attributes.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The minor security concern is the exposure of object attributes, which could include sensitive data if objects are not sanitized.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects that the code is benign but with a slight caveat regarding data exposure depending on context.",
