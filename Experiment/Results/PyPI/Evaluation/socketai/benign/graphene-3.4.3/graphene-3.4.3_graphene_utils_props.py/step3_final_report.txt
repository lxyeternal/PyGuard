  "purpose": "Utility function to extract object attributes that are not inherited from specified classes, for introspection purposes.",
  "sources": "dir(x) to list attributes, vars(x) and getattr(x, key) to access attribute values.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "dir(x) -> filtering with _all_vars -> vars(x).get() or getattr() to retrieve attribute values.",
  "anomalies": "Potential exposure of sensitive data if object x contains private or sensitive attributes, but no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two empty classes and creates a set of their combined attribute names. The function props(x) filters attributes of x to those not in _all_vars, using reflection tools. No external I/O, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The pattern is typical for introspection. While it could expose sensitive data if present in x, the code itself does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. Slight security concern (score 0.1) is justified due to potential data exposure but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for extracting custom object properties, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk associated with exposing object attributes is acknowledged but not indicative of malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
