{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two classes and a function to extract properties from an object, filtering out attributes inherited from these classes.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attribute listings via dir() and object attribute dictionaries via vars() and getattr()",
  "sinks": "The function could potentially expose object attributes that are not part of the predefined classes, but there are no external data sinks like network or file operations",
  "flows": "Attributes of input objects are collected and filtered based on class attribute sets, without any data being sent elsewhere or used insecurely",
  "anomalies": "The use of dir() combined with vars() and getattr() to dynamically access attributes is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code is present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two placeholder classes and combines their directory listings into a set to filter out inherited attributes. The function props retrieves attributes of an object that are not part of these classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's structure is straightforward, aiming to get custom properties of objects excluding standard class attributes. Overall, this appears to be a utility function for introspection, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an introspection utility to extract non-inherited properties of objects. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
