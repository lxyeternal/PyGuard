  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the claims with the original code.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n```python\nfrom warnings import warn\n\ndef warn_deprecation(text: str):\n    warn(text, category=DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)\n```\nThis is a straightforward utility function that issues a deprecation warning with a custom message. It uses Python's standard `warnings.warn()` function, specifying the warning category and stack level.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code is simple, standard, and correctly implemented. It doesn't contain any bugs or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malicious behavior?**  \n  None. The code only issues warnings based on input; it doesn't perform any malicious actions.\n\n- **Obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is clear and uses standard Python features.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The input `text` is just a string passed to `warn()`. There's no handling of untrusted data beyond this, and no code execution or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- **Purpose:** All describe the code as a simple wrapper to issue deprecation warnings.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Input flows into `warn()`, which outputs to stderr or logs depending on environment—standard behavior.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All agree the code is standard, benign, and serves a typical purpose.\n\n**Scores:**\n- `malware`: 0 (correct; no malicious intent)\n- `obfuscated`: 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- `securityRisk`: 0 (correct; no security issues)\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports correctly assign 0, and I concur. The code doesn't perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is a benign utility function.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The code does not process untrusted data in a dangerous way.  \n- No hidden behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.  \n- The use of standard library functions further reduces risk.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe reports are consistent with my assessment. There is no evidence to suggest any security concern beyond normal warning issuance.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard implementation of a deprecation warning utility. All scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
