  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe code defines a simple function `warn_deprecation` that wraps the standard `warnings.warn` call, issuing a deprecation warning with a custom message and a stack level of 2. It uses only standard library functions and does not process untrusted data beyond the message parameter.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is straightforward and correctly implemented for issuing warnings.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- The logic is sound, and the data flow is safe.\n\n**Scores for all reports:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- SecurityRisk: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\nThese scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of the Reports:\n\n**1-5 Reports:**\n- All describe the same functionality: a wrapper for issuing deprecation warnings.\n- They all correctly identify that the code uses standard library functions and poses no security risks.\n- The reasoning is sound; no suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are claimed or implied.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n- No issues are present in the code or the reasoning.\n- The risk score remains at 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The malware score is correctly 0; no malicious activity is suggested.\n- Obfuscation is correctly identified as absent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a simple, standard utility function for issuing deprecation warnings.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The scores assigned across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and secure.\n- The reports correctly identify the functionality and risks.\n- The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed.",
