  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward wrapper around Python's standard 'warnings.warn' function.\n- It accepts a string 'text' and issues a DeprecationWarning with a specified stack level.\n- No untrusted data handling beyond the input parameter; no external data sources, dynamic code execution, or hardcoded secrets.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious activity.\n- The 'warnings' module's behavior depends on environment configuration but is standard for issuing warnings.\n\n**Review of each report:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the code as a standard utility for issuing deprecation warnings.\n- The purpose, data flow, and sinks are consistent.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or security risks are detected.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0, which is appropriate since there's no malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Logical or scoring issues:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- No report suggests any vulnerability or malicious intent that warrants a higher risk score.\n\n**Potential concerns or challenges:**\n- Since the code only issues warnings based on input, if the input 'text' were maliciously crafted (e.g., containing malicious content), it could cause issues in logs or stderr, but not a security vulnerability per se.\n- The 'malware' score remains 0 across all reports, which is correct given the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and does not pose security risks.\n- The scoring aligns well with the code's characteristics.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a simple, safe utility function for issuing deprecation warnings.**",
