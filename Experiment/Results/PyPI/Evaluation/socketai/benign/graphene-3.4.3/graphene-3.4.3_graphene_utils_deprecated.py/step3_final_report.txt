  "purpose": "A utility function to issue deprecation warnings with a custom message using Python's standard warnings module.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'text' which is a string passed directly to warnings.warn.",
  "sinks": "The warnings output (stderr or logs) generated by warnings.warn, which is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "The 'text' parameter flows into warnings.warn(), resulting in a warning message being emitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that wraps warnings.warn to issue a deprecation warning with a specified message. It relies solely on Python's standard warnings module, with no external data sources or dynamic code execution. The input 'text' is a string used directly in the warning, with no processing that could introduce security issues. The code is free of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of this utility. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's functionality and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for issuing deprecation warnings. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
