{
  "purpose": "This code defines a function to issue deprecation warnings to inform users about outdated features or functions.",
  "sources": "The function takes a string input 'text' which is used as the warning message.",
  "sinks": "The 'warn' function outputs the warning message, potentially to logs or stderr, but not affecting security directly.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from the function parameter to the 'warn' call, which then outputs the message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and uses standard library features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'warn' function from the 'warnings' module and defines a single function 'warn_deprecation' that calls 'warn' with the provided message and sets the warning category to DeprecationWarning with a stack level of 2. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It simply creates a wrapper for issuing deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a standard purpose of warning about deprecated features. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
