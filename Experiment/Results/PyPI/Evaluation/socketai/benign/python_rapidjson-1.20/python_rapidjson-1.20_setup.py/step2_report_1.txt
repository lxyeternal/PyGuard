  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a packaging/build script, reading version info, documentation, and submodule presence.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious sinks; flows are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious code, no external network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The script is standard, safe, and malicious activity is not detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes configuration, environment, and file reads.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; configuration is standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no external activity, standard build routines.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (slightly above zero, perhaps due to the environmental adjustments), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly conservative but reasonable. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code, routine environment detection.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the setup process.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious sinks; local file reads and environment variables.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; standard setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical, safe setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1-0.2), reflecting the dynamic environment adjustments and configuration complexity, but these are standard practices and do not constitute security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk:** 0.05 — very low, as the script performs typical build setup tasks, with minor environment-specific adjustments that are standard.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and conservative in their assessments. The code is a typical setup script with no signs of supply chain risk or malicious intent.",
