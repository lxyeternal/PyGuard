  "purpose": "The code reads JSON benchmark data from a file, processes it to generate comparison tables for various JSON libraries, and outputs formatted tables and footnotes.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data from a file, accesses library version info for footnotes",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted tables and footnotes via print statements",
  "flows": "JSON data loaded from file -> processed into normalized tables -> printed as formatted output",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward data processing with no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The script performs benign operations: loading JSON benchmark results, normalizing data, and printing formatted tables. It imports external libraries solely for data parsing and version info, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present. The code is clear and intended for reporting purposes, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign benchmarking report generator with no malicious or security concerns. It performs straightforward data processing and output, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The assessments in the provided reports are accurate, with only minor overestimation of risk in one case. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
