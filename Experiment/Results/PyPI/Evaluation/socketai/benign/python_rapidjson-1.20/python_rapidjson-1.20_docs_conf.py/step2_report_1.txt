  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Sphinx configuration file.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code, external network activity, or executable logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- The code is static, primarily setting configuration parameters for documentation generation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static configuration script with no malicious or suspicious content.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports find any malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Data flow:** No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely static.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate: the code is standard, with no signs of security issues.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign very low (0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal or no security risk, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- Since all reports agree and the code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration, there is no reason to adjust the scores.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low; there's no indication of any security concern.\n- The malware score is correctly zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but given the conservative approach, 0.1 is acceptable for a benign configuration file)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard, benign configuration file with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The report accurately reflects the benign nature of the code.",
