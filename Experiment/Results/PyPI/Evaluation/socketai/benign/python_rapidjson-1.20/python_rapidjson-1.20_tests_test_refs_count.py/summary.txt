  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured leak detection suite for the rapidjson library, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. and a very low risk score (0 or 0.1) due to debug-only functions. Overall, it is safe and suitable for internal testing purposes."
