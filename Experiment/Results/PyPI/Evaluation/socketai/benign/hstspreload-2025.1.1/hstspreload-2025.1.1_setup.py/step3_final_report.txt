{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging the 'hstspreload' Python project. It reads version info from a source file, reads README.md for description, and invokes setuptools.setup() with static and dynamic parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'hstspreload/__init__.py' via regex; reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external commands or network activity; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "Version info flows from source file to setup() via regex; description flows from README.md to setup(). No untrusted data flows to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard practices; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static file reads and calls setup() with static and extracted data. The regex for version extraction is simple and safe. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. The code adheres to common packaging patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the scores should reflect this.",
