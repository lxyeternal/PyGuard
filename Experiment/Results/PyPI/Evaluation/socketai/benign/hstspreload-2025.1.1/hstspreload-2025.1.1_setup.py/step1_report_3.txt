  "purpose": "Setup script for the hstspreload Python package, defining package metadata and reading version info.",
  "sources": "Reading the __version__ variable from hstspreload/__init__.py; Reading README.md file",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external commands executed",
  "flows": "Reading version info from file -> setup configuration; reading README -> setup description",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or unusual behavior observed; standard setup.py pattern",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information dynamically from a specific module file, which is common practice. It also reads a README for the long description. No untrusted input sources, no data leaks, no command executions, and no suspicious code flows. The package data inclusion appears standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious logic. Overall, this appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It follows standard practices for Python package setup.",
