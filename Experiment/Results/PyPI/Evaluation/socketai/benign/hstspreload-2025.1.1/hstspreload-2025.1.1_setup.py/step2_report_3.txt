  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the scoring assigned.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Reads version info from `hstspreload/__init__.py` using regex.\n- Reads README.md for long description.\n- Calls `setuptools.setup()` with static and dynamic data.\n- No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the description: it's a standard setup script.\n- No issues with code logic or data flow.\n- No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **No evident errors or flaws**. The code is straightforward and follows common practices.\n- The regex used to extract version is simple and safe.\n- No potential for injection or data leakage from reading static files.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score (0):** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Correct. No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score (0):** Correct. No security risks identified.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no malicious or risky behavior, scores should remain at 0.\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the script as benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- They uniformly assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a typical, safe setup script with no security issues.**",
