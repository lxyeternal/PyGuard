{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'hstspreload', extracting version information from an init file, reading a README for long description, and configuring package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from 'hstspreload/__init__.py' and the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "The version string extracted from the init file is used directly in the setup configuration; the long description is directly read from the README file and used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard package setup tasks: reading the version number from a source file using regex, loading a markdown README file, and invoking setuptools.setup() with static and dynamically read data. No external data sources or untrusted inputs influence control flow or system commands. The code does not execute any external or dynamic code, nor does it contain hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
