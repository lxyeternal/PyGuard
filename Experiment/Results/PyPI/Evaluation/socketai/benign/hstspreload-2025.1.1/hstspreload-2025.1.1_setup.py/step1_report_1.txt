  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package called 'hstspreload', used to distribute a Chromium HSTS Preload list as a Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads the version from '__init__.py' file, reads the README.md file for long description, and package data from the 'hstspreload' directory.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows into untrusted sources that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The version string read from a source file is used in package metadata; no untrusted data flows to critical functions or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code reads version information from a file and the README for description, then calls setup() with package metadata. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. All operations are typical for package distribution scripts and do not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and normal in the context of package distribution.",
