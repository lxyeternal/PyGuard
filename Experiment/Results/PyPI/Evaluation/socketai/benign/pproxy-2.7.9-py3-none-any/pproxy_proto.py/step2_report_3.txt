  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and the reasoning behind their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a multi-protocol proxy framework with no obvious malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks. It is complex but appears legitimate.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 (moderate, due to complexity and potential misuse)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The complexity could be misused, but in isolation, the code is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it highlights the complexity and potential for misuse but finds no direct malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (lower, reflecting less concern)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's nature. The detailed cryptographic handling and protocol support are standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a multi-protocol proxy with no explicit malicious behavior, but the complexity and flexibility could be exploited.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, given no malicious signs)\n- **Confidence:** 0.85\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The potential for misuse exists, but the code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a multi-protocol proxy framework, with no explicit malicious actions. Its flexibility could be exploited, but no malware is evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 (slightly higher)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 (moderate, considering the potential for misuse)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:** The malware score is slightly elevated, perhaps due to the cryptographic functions and system-level socket access, which could be misused. However, no malicious payloads are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** A comprehensive proxy framework with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; the code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, indicating no malicious payloads or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting the complexity and potential for misuse but no explicit malicious activity.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a multi-protocol proxy framework, with complex features like SSL wrapping, WebSocket handling, and system socket info access.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The cryptographic functions and protocol implementations follow standard practices.\n- The potential for misuse exists due to flexibility, but that does not equate to malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and well-structured)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (moderate, mainly due to complexity and potential misuse if misconfigured)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, multi-protocol proxy framework with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider deployment context; misconfiguration or malicious inputs could cause misuse, but based solely on the code provided, it is not malicious.",
