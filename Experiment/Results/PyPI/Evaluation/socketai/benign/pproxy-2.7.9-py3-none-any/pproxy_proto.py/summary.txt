  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, multi-protocol proxy framework with no explicit malicious payloads or backdoors. Its extensive protocol support and cryptographic features could be exploited if misused, but the code itself does not contain malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code appears safe for deployment with standard security controls."
