  "review": "Let's proceed step-by-step to analyze these reports thoroughly.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Multi-protocol proxy framework (HTTP, SOCKS, WebSocket, etc.)  \n- No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors.  \n- Extensive protocol support, complex but legitimate.  \n- No malicious payloads detected.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.4\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly identifies the code as a multi-protocol proxy with no explicit malicious intent.  \n- The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious payloads or backdoors.  \n- The security risk score is moderate, considering the complexity and potential for misuse, but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- The logic and scoring seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Multi-protocol proxy, with emphasis on SSL, cryptography, and protocol handling.  \n- Contains complex cryptographic functions, placeholders, and protocol implementations.  \n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.  \n- Notes potential for obfuscation but no evidence of malware.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.3\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report appropriately notes the code's complexity and potential for misuse but finds no direct malicious behavior.  \n- The malware score of 0 is justified given the lack of malicious payloads or suspicious cryptography.  \n- The risk score is moderate, considering cryptographic operations and protocol flexibility.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- The scoring appears reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Multi-protocol proxy, including SSL, WebSocket, SOCKS, HTTP, etc.  \n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.  \n- Capable of covert or obfuscated use but no explicit malicious actions.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly emphasizes the potential for misuse due to flexibility but finds no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- Malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.  \n- The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- The scoring seems justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Multi-protocol proxy, SSL wrapping, WebSocket, system info access.  \n- Capable of covert channels, traffic interception, or system reconnaissance if misused.  \n- No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors.  \n- Malware score: 0.2 (some potential for misuse)  \n- Risk score: 0.4\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report correctly notes the potential risks due to protocol flexibility and SSL handling, but no explicit malware.  \n- Malware score of 0.2 reflects the potential for misuse, which is reasonable given the capabilities.  \n- The risk score is moderate, appropriate for the described features.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- The scoring aligns well with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**  \n- Purpose: Multi-protocol proxy with features similar to others.  \n- No signs of malware or malicious intent.  \n- Uses standard practices, no hardcoded secrets.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Risk score: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The report's conclusion is consistent with the code's features and the absence of malicious indicators.  \n- Malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- The risk score is low, considering the potential for misconfiguration but no inherent malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- The scoring appears appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- All reports consistently recognize the code as a complex, multi-protocol proxy framework with no explicit malicious payloads or backdoors.  \n- The malware scores are all 0 or very low, which aligns with the absence of hardcoded secrets, payloads, or suspicious code snippets.  \n- The risk scores are moderate, reflecting the potential for misuse due to the code's flexibility and capabilities but not indicating inherent malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware scores:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as no malicious payloads or backdoors are detected.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly indicate 0, as the code is not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk scores:** Could be slightly increased to 0.3–0.4 in some reports (especially #4) to reflect the potential for misuse if misconfigured, but current scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk score:** **0.3** (moderate, due to complexity and potential misuse, but no inherent maliciousness)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified in their scoring. The code itself appears to be a legitimate, albeit complex, multi-protocol proxy framework with no explicit malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for misuse, which is already reflected in the risk scores.",
