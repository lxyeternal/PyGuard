  "purpose": "This code imports specific attributes from a local module named 'server' and assigns them to local variables, likely for configuring proxy rules or connection settings.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'server'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; simply assigns imported attributes to local variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code appears straightforward and typical for configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific elements from a relative module 'server' and assigns them to variables. It does not process any external inputs, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. The variables 'Connection', 'Server', 'Rule', and 'DIRECT' are assigned attributes or constants from the module, which is standard practice. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be part of a configuration or setup routine for a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
