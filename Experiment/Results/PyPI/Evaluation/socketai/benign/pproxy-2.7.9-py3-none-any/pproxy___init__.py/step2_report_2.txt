  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, importing attributes from a local 'server' module and assigning them to variables.\n- No external inputs, no dynamic code, no network operations, and no suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is minimal and appears to be configuration or setup code, likely part of a larger system.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Claim:** No malicious intent, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Claim:** Similar benign interpretation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low), obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, but still minimal. No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Claim:** Benign, configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Claim:** Same benign pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk, still very low.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Claim:** Benign, straightforward import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are there any signs of malware or malicious behavior?**  \n  No. All reports and the code snippet show no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Is the malware score justified as 0?**  \n  Yes. No suspicious behavior, no code execution, no data exfiltration, no network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated code score:**  \n  Correctly 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Security risk scores:**  \n  Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, reflecting minimal concern due to the code's simplicity. These are acceptable as low risk.\n\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0. Given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0 (e.g., 0.1) is acceptable, but should not be higher unless additional context suggests risk.\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate (after review):\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal configuration risk, but not malicious)  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple import and assignment pattern with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The current scores are reasonable; I recommend maintaining them with a malware score of 0 and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
