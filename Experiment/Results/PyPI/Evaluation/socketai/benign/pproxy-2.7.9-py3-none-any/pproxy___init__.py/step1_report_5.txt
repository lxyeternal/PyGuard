{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing functions and variables from a module named 'server' and assigning some of these to local variables, likely for further use in network proxy configuration or rules.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.'. No external data input or environment variables are read.",
  "sinks": "Assigning imported functions/variables to local names; no direct data leak or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code only reassigns imported objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import from a relative module and assigns several attributes from that module to local variables. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. The simplicity reduces likelihood of malicious intent, and there are no signs of obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import and assignment pattern typical in modular Python projects. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The snippet appears benign, serving as a setup for proxy-related operations.",
