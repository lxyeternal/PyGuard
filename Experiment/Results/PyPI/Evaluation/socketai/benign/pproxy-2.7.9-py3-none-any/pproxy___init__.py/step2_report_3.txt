  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their validity, consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe very similar code: importing attributes from a local 'server' module and assigning them to variables.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or network operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The scores assigned to malware are all zero, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), which seems appropriate given the limited scope.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** None of the reports identify any actual issues in the code snippet. The code appears benign.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:** The reports are consistent in their analysis, emphasizing the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores for each issue:**\n  - **Malware score:** All zero, which is justified.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** All zero, consistent with the code's clarity.\n  - **Risk score:** Very low, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely configuration/setup code, with no malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1), which is reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low; none of the reports suggest any real vulnerability.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Potential for higher risk or malware:** Given the code's simplicity, there is no basis for higher malware or risk scores.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly note the lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Consistency of scores:** The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of around 0.1 seems appropriate, perhaps slightly higher (e.g., 0.2) if considering that this code is part of a larger system that could be misused if combined with malicious code elsewhere.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (leaning towards 0.1, as the code is very straightforward)\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThis code snippet is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that this is a simple, configuration-related code fragment with minimal security concern.",
