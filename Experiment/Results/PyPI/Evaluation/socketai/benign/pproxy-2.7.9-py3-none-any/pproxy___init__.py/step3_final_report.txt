{
  "purpose": "This code imports attributes from a local 'server' module and assigns them to variables, likely for configuration or setup within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'server' module",
  "sinks": "Assignment of imported attributes to variables; no untrusted data handling or external input",
  "flows": "Import from 'server' -> assignment to variables (Connection, Server, Rule, DIRECT)",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and assignment without obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing simple imports and variable assignments from a local module. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious behavior justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
