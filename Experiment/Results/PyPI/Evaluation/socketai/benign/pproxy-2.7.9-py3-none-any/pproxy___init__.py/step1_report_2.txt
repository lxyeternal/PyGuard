{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'server' and assigns some of its attributes to local variables, likely for use in network or proxy configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from . import server'. Access to 'server.proxies_by_uri' and 'server.compile_rule'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of 'server.proxies_by_uri' and 'server.compile_rule' to local variables. No direct data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Imported 'server' module's attributes are assigned to local variables; no data flow from untrusted sources is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and assigns specific attributes to variables. These attributes appear to relate to proxies and rules, possibly for network configuration. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of a legitimate configuration or utility script.",
