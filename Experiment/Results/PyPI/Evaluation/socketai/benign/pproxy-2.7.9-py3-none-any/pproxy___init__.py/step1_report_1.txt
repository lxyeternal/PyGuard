{
  "purpose": "This code imports components from a local module named 'server' and assigns specific attributes to variables, likely for configuring or controlling network proxy rules.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import server' which accesses local module attributes",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "Assignment of 'server.proxies_by_uri' to 'Connection' and 'Server', and 'server.compile_rule' to 'Rule', indicating data flow from module attributes to local variables",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and appears to be configuration or setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple import and assignment operations. It accesses attributes from a local module 'server' and assigns them to variables. No external input handling, no data processing, no suspicious function calls, and no obfuscated or complex code patterns. It appears to be part of a larger codebase for managing proxies or network rules. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple setup snippet that imports and assigns variables from a local module without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and purely functional.",
