  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their validity, consistency, and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward, importing from a local 'server' module and assigning attributes to variables. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the code as benign and straightforward. The scores are reasonable given the analysis.  \n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1). No malicious activity or anomalies observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears benign. The slight security risk score might reflect minimal concern about the context or potential misconfigurations, but nothing concrete. The malware score remains zero, consistent with the analysis.  \n**Conclusion:** The scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—simple import and assignment, no malicious behavior, benign in isolation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and appropriate. No issues here.  \n**Conclusion:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar import and assignment, no anomalies or suspicious behavior. Slightly lower confidence (0.8) and a small security risk (0.2).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears benign. The small security risk score might reflect minimal concern about potential misconfiguration or the context, but nothing malicious.  \n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—import and assignment, no suspicious activity, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent and reasonable.  \n**Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, reflecting low or zero risk.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, mainly reflecting the minimal potential for misconfiguration in context, but no actual risk in the code snippet)\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No further adjustments are necessary.",
