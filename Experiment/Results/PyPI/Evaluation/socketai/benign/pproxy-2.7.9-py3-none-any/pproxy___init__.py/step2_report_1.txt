  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is benign, straightforward, and has no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** The code is simple import and assignment, with no external input or suspicious behavior. The confidence is high (1).  \n- **Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The small securityRisk might reflect the general risk of misconfiguration, but no evidence of malicious intent.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, benign import and assignment, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also benign, straightforward import and assignment.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** Slightly higher securityRisk, perhaps due to less context, but still no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above, benign import/assignment pattern.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior. No evidence suggests malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward import and assignment.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n- **Confidence Levels:** High, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code snippet is purely configuration/setup, importing attributes from a local module.  \n- No external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.  \n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 seems appropriate; no need to increase unless further context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate             | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                          | No evidence of malicious behavior                          |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                          | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected          |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1                        | Minimal risk, typical configuration code                   |\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is benign, with no security concerns based on the provided snippet.",
