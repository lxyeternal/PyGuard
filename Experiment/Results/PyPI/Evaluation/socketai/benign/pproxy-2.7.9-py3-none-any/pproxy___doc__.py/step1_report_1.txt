{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and retrieve version information for the 'pproxy' Python package.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned string literals (__title__, __license__, etc.), import statements, and exception handling blocks for version retrieval.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output beyond setting variables and importing modules.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; version info is retrieved from package management utilities.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception handling to obtain version info is standard, but the code imports external modules that could potentially be malicious if compromised. However, in this context, the code appears typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables, attempts to import version info from external tools (setuptools_scm and pkg_resources), and defaults to 'unknown' if those imports fail. No user input, network activity, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code's structure is straightforward, with clear intent to manage package info. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package metadata definition with version retrieval logic. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code fragment.",
