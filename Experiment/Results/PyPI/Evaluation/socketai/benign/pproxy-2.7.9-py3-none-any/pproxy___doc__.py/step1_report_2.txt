  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the pproxy Python package, including version retrieval logic.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__title__, __license__, __description__, __keywords__, __author__, __email__, __url__, __version__). Version retrieval functions (get_version, get_distribution).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; version info is retrieved via package management tools but not from external input during runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple fallback methods for version retrieval is standard, no anomalies. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes package metadata attributes, attempts to dynamically determine version using 'setuptools_scm' and 'pkg_resources', with exception handling to set a default 'unknown' version. All operations are standard for Python package setup and do not involve external input or malicious constructs. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package metadata definition with version detection logic. No malicious intent, anomalies, or security risks are present.",
