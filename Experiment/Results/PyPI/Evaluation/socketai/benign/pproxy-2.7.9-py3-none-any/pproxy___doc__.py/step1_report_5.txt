{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'pproxy' Python package, including version retrieval logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string variables, and attempts to import versioning functions from third-party modules (setuptools_scm and pkg_resources).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining metadata variables to conditional imports that set the version number based on external modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behavior are observed. The import attempts are standard for package versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily assigns metadata variables such as __title__, __license__, __description__, etc. It then attempts to determine the package version by importing get_version from setuptools_scm. If that fails, it tries to get the version via pkg_resources. Fallback is setting version to 'unknown'. There is no data processing, input handling, or code execution beyond these imports. No malicious code or suspicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package metadata and versioning logic with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages package information and version retrieval with common practices.",
