  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code sets package metadata and retrieves version info via standard methods. No untrusted data, no network activity, no obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly notes that the code manages package metadata and version retrieval using standard fallback mechanisms. No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the code is straightforward, assigning static strings and attempting to get version info via well-known libraries with exception handling. No untrusted input or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard package metadata setup with conventional version retrieval methods. No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, straightforward metadata assignment and version retrieval.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is standard package setup code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; all reports agree.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of untrusted data, network activity, or suspicious constructs, a risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical, benign package metadata and version retrieval snippet with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
