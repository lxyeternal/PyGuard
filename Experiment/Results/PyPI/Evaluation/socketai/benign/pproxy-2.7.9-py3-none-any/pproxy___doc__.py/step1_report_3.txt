  "purpose": "Define package metadata and version retrieval logic for the 'pproxy' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata variables (__title__, __license__, etc.), importing version retrieval functions (setuptools_scm.get_version, pkg_resources.get_distribution).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "Metadata variables are assigned static strings; version retrieval functions are called conditionally but are standard library functions, with no user data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The version retrieval approach is standard and fallback mechanisms are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets package metadata variables with static information. It attempts to retrieve the version dynamically via common methods used in Python packaging. The exception handling is straightforward, and no user input or untrusted data is processed. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The metadata variables are non-sensitive strings. Overall, the code appears to be a typical setup or metadata configuration file with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely assigns descriptive information and retrieves version info through conventional methods, posing no threat.",
