{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and retrieve version information for the 'pproxy' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for package info; imports of 'setuptools_scm' and 'pkg_resources' modules for version retrieval.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input processed.",
  "flows": "Imports and exception handling flow to assign '__version__' based on external modules, fallback to 'unknown'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard pattern for package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static metadata variables, attempts to dynamically retrieve version info via well-known modules with exception handling, and defaults to 'unknown'. There are no network calls, user inputs, or suspicious constructs. The external modules used are common in package management but could pose supply chain risks if compromised; however, the code itself does not execute any malicious actions. The structure is straightforward and transparent, with no obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package metadata script with version retrieval fallback. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with its benign nature.",
