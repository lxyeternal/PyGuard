  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No, the code does not contain malicious behavior.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** The logic is straightforward; exception handling for version retrieval is standard.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No, the code remains standard for package metadata.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No, the code is typical for setup or metadata files.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid evaluation.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No, the version retrieval logic is standard.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Correct.  \n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No, the code remains typical for package metadata.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No anomalies or malicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; thus, malware should be 0.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward and not obfuscated; 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, the risk score should be low, around 0.0 to 0.1. The reports currently assign 0, which is reasonable.  \n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the code's content.  \n- No changes are necessary.  \n- The code is a standard package metadata snippet with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0 (or very close to zero)  \n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely for package setup and version management without any security concerns.",
