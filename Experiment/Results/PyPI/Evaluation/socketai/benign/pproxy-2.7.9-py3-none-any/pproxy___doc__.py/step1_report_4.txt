{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and retrieve version information for the 'pproxy' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading module attributes, importing 'setuptools_scm' or 'pkg_resources' to get version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Retrieving version info from external libraries based on exceptions; no user input or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent. The code straightforwardly attempts to set version info from known sources with fallback.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata attributes such as title, license, description, keywords, author, email, and URL. It then attempts to obtain the package version via 'setuptools_scm.get_version()' with exception handling, falling back to 'pkg_resources.get_distribution()' if needed. If both imports fail, it defaults to 'unknown'. The process involves standard practices for package versioning and metadata management. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are evident. The code is simple and maintains conventional patterns for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely manages package metadata and version retrieval without any malicious intent or security issues. It follows typical package setup patterns and contains no malware or obfuscation.",
