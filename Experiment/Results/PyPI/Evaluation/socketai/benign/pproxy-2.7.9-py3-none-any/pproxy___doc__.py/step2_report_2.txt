  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code in question is a straightforward package metadata and version retrieval snippet.\n- It imports well-known modules (`setuptools_scm`, `pkg_resources`) to determine the package version.\n- It employs exception handling to fallback gracefully if modules are missing.\n- There are no user inputs, network calls, or dynamic data processing.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The variables are static strings describing package info.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of the reports:**\n\n**Report 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- They assign a malware score of 0, confidence of 1, obfuscated of 0, and securityRisk of 0.\n- The reasoning is consistent and justified: the code is typical for package setup scripts.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The only slight concern is the import of external modules (`setuptools_scm`, `pkg_resources`) which, if compromised, could be malicious. However, in the context of package setup code, this is standard practice, and the code does not execute any untrusted code or perform malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Given the code's benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; score of 0 is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code does not perform any risky operations, a score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Any adjustment?**  \nNo, the scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional considerations:**\n\n- **Is there any hidden malicious intent?**  \n  No. The code is a typical package metadata script.\n\n- **Could compromised modules be a vector?**  \n  While importing external modules can be a vector if those modules are malicious, the code itself does not execute any malicious code. The risk is external and not evident here.\n\n- **Is there any obfuscation or suspicious pattern?**  \n  No.\n\n---\n\n### **Final verdict:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese are aligned with the code's content and the detailed reasoning in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and justified. The code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's benign nature.",
