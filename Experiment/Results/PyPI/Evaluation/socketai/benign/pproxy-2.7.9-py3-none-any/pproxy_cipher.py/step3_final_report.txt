  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility classes and factory function for cipher selection and data encryption/decryption.",
  "sources": "Input data from network streams, user input, or file reads; key and IV generation from os.urandom and provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted data output, decrypted data returned, or data written to streams or network sockets.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through cipher decrypt/encrypt methods, with dynamic setup and stream modifications; key and IV are derived or generated, then used in cryptographic operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; dynamic method patching is complex but standard in cryptographic wrappers; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple standard cryptographic classes using well-known libraries, with proper key and IV management. The dynamic cipher selection and stream modifications are typical for such utilities. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's structure and practices align with legitimate cryptographic modules, and the absence of suspicious patterns supports a low malware likelihood. The low risk score (0.2) reflects potential misuse if misconfigured but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
