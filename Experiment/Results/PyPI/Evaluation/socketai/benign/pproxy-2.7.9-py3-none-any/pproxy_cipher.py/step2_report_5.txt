  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code implements various cryptographic classes with proper setup, using standard libraries, secure IV generation, and key derivation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious activity. The malware score of 0 is justified given the lack of malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning appears sound. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on flexible cipher options, proper key/IV handling, and no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; the complexity of dynamic cipher selection does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code provides multiple cipher implementations with standard practices. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are justified.\n- **Justification:** The dynamic cipher selection and stream handling are typical in cryptographic utilities, not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports; no suspicious network activity or obfuscation. The code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The complexity does not indicate malicious intent; standard cryptographic practices are used.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning holds.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code defines multiple cipher classes, with dynamic selection and stream manipulation, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code's complexity is typical for cryptographic utilities, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity and standard library usage.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting the potential for misconfiguration but not actual malicious intent.\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to the complex dynamic code and stream handling, which could be misused if misconfigured, but not inherently dangerous)\n\n**Note:** The overall assessment aligns with the reports. The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility module with no malicious intent. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard cryptographic utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- The risk is low but acknowledges potential misconfiguration risks.  \n- The provided reports' scores are justified.  \n- My estimated scores: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2**.",
