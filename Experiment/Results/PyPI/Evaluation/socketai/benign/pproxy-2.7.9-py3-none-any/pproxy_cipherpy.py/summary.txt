  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic library implementing standard algorithms and modes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors. The static constants are typical for cryptographic primitives and do not indicate malicious intent. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk remains low. Proper deployment and validation are recommended to prevent misuse of static parameters."
