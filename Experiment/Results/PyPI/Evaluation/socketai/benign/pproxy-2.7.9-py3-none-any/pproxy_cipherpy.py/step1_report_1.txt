  "purpose": "This code provides implementations of various symmetric encryption algorithms, including stream ciphers, block ciphers, and combined modes, primarily for cryptographic purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data during encryption/decryption functions and initializes cryptographic keys, IVs, or nonces during setup or construction of cipher objects.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks can occur if untrusted input is encrypted or decrypted without proper validation; some methods process external data (e.g., poly1305, ghash) and return cryptographic outputs or tags.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (plaintext, ciphertext, keys, nonces) into encryption/decryption methods, with intermediate steps involving key expansion, cryptographic transformations, and MAC/tag generation; outputs are produced as encrypted data or authentication tags.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity are present. The code implements standard cryptographic algorithms with proper cryptographic procedures. The only notable aspect is the use of static base64-encoded constants, which is typical for cryptographic parameters, not malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple cipher classes implementing cryptographic algorithms, including AES, Blowfish, Camellia, IDEA, SEED, RC2, and various modes/modes with secure practices such as key derivation, setup, and MAC calculation. No code shows signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. Functions and methods operate as expected for cryptographic routines, with no suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks outside normal cryptographic processes. The base64 constants are used as cryptographic parameters, not as malicious payloads or secrets. The code appears to be a library of cryptographic primitives intended for secure encryption tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains standard, well-implemented cryptographic algorithms without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It serves as a cryptography library with no evident security risks or malicious functionalities.",
