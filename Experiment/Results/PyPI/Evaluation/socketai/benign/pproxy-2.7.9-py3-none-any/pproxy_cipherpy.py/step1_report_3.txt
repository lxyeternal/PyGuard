  "purpose": "This code provides a collection of various symmetric cipher implementations, including classic algorithms like AES, Blowfish, Camellia, IDEA, SEED, RC2, and modern authenticated encryption schemes like ChaCha20 and GCM. The purpose is to facilitate encryption and decryption operations within larger security or cryptographic projects.",
  "sources": "Key inputs (self.key, self.iv, self.nonce) during object initialization, data passed to encrypt/decrypt methods, and structure unpacking of provided byte sequences.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted outputs from encrypt methods, potential return values from core or process functions, and assertions in process functions (e.g., poly1305).",
  "flows": "Data flows from key and IV inputs through setup or initialization methods, then to encryption/decryption routines, with cryptographic computations occurring in core or process functions, and results returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of extensive classic cipher implementations (e.g., Blowfish, IDEA, SEED) which are uncommon in modern security contexts. Use of base64-encoded constants for S-boxes and round keys, which could be used to hide secrets, but here appear to be standard static constants. No obvious hardcoded credentials or secret keys are found. The code includes self-caching of cipher objects and static data, but no suspicious network, file, or system commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple cryptographic algorithms, including symmetric ciphers and modes like CFB, CTR, GCM, and Poly1305. The algorithms use standard cryptographic constructs such as key expansion, permutation tables, and block operations. No dynamic or external input is used to generate secrets at runtime that could indicate malicious backdoors. The constants (e.g., S-boxes, round keys) are static and consistent with known cryptographic standards. There are no network operations, file I/O, or code that leaks data externally. All cryptographic routines seem purpose-built for encryption tasks within an application. The code structure is typical for cryptographic implementations and does not contain suspicious code injections, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a comprehensive set of cryptographic primitives and cipher modes without malicious intent. It does not include any network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or other malware-like behaviors. The static constants and implementation style are consistent with standard cryptographic libraries. No security-critical vulnerabilities or sabotage mechanisms are evident in this isolated module.",
