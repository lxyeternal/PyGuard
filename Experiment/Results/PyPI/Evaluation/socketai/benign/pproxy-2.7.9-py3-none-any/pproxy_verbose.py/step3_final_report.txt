  "purpose": "Network traffic monitoring and statistics display utility, reading data from stdin and outputting formatted traffic stats to stdout.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.stdin via readline(), processes user input and internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted statistics to sys.stdout, including real-time updates and summaries.",
  "flows": "Input from stdin updates internal 'stats' data structures via closures; output functions read from these structures to generate display; real-time stats periodically read snapshots of 'stats' for calculations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambdas for simple functions, closure-based updates, and asyncio for real-time display are standard patterns; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a network traffic statistics collector and display tool, utilizing standard Python libraries and patterns. It reads input data, updates internal counters, and displays formatted output. No network connections to external servers, no data exfiltration, no code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The use of lambdas and closures is typical for such scripts and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The input handling from stdin and output to stdout are typical for CLI utilities and do not pose security risks. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate network traffic monitoring utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
