      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward proxy configuration utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its main security concern is the lack of input validation, which could be exploited to cause misconfiguration or system issues. No malware or backdoors are detected. The risk score is moderate due to potential misuse, but overall, the code is not malicious."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits complex cryptographic routines and buffer manipulations that could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as covert channels or obfuscation, but no explicit malicious activity is detected. The current assessments and scores are reasonable and align with the code's suspicious but non-malicious appearance. Further review of cryptographic practices and buffer handling is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, sophisticated multi-protocol proxy framework. It does not contain malware or malicious routines. Its complexity and plugin support could be exploited if misused, but no evidence of malicious intent exists in the current code. The security risk is moderate, primarily due to external plugin and configuration trust assumptions."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, multi-protocol proxy framework with no explicit malicious payloads or backdoors. Its extensive protocol support and cryptographic features could be exploited if misused, but the code itself does not contain malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code appears safe for deployment with standard security controls."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic library implementing standard algorithms and modes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors. The static constants are typical for cryptographic primitives and do not indicate malicious intent. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk remains low. Proper deployment and validation are recommended to prevent misuse of static parameters."
