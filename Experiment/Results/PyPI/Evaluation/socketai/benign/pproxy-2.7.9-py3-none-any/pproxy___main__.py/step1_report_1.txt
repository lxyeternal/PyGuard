  "purpose": "To execute the main function imported from the server module if the script is run as the main program.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'main' from the local '.server' module.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()', which executes the main function from the server module.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' from '.server' -> execution of 'main()' if '__name__' == '__main__'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if it is executed as the main program, then imports 'main' from a local module 'server' and calls it. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The only potential concern could be what 'main()' does in the 'server' module, but within this snippet, there are no indications of malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard entry-point pattern in Python scripts that delegates execution to a 'main' function. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this code fragment.",
