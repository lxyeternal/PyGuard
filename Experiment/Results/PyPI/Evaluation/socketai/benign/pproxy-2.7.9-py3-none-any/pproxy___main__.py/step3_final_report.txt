  "purpose": "Standard Python entry point that delegates execution to server.main()",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import from .server and executes main()",
  "sinks": "The call to main() could be a sink if server.main() performs malicious actions, but not within this snippet",
  "flows": "From the script start, through the import, to the call of main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python script entry point pattern, checking if __name__ == '__main__', then importing and executing server.main(). All reports agree that this pattern is benign, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. The actual security implications depend on server.main() implementation, which is outside this scope. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score is minimal (0 or 0.1), reflecting the code's simplicity. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9-1), given the lack of suspicious features or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk and malware scores are correctly low, and the overall assessment aligns across reports. Any security concerns should focus on server.main() implementation, not this snippet.",
