  "purpose": "The code executes the main function from the server module when run as the main program.",
  "sources": "The code imports the main function from the local server module.",
  "sinks": "The main() function call could potentially execute code within the server module, but no direct untrusted data handling or external data sinks are visible here.",
  "flows": "Execution flows from the import statement to the main() call within the __main__ block.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a standard Python entry point pattern, importing and executing a main function from a local module. It does not handle input data directly, nor does it contain any suspicious code. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of the server.main() function, which is not shown. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present in this snippet itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard application entry point with no malicious or suspicious behavior identified. Its security risk is minimal, contingent on the security of the server.main() implementation.",
