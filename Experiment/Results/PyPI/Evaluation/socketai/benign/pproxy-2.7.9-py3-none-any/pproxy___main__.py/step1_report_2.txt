{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for a Python application, importing and executing the main function from the server module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from the local 'server' module.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'main()' could potentially execute code within the 'server' module, but without further details, it is a typical application startup.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the import of 'main' to its execution; there are no external data flows or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward application entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if it is being run as the main module, then imports 'main' from a local 'server' module and executes it. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior evident. The code appears to be a simple application bootstrap.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python script entry point with no signs of malicious behavior. It simply imports and runs a function, typical for server or application startup scripts.",
