  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward proxy configuration utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its main security concern is the lack of input validation, which could be exploited to cause misconfiguration or system issues. No malware or backdoors are detected. The risk score is moderate due to potential misuse, but overall, the code is not malicious."
