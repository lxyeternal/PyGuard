  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, sophisticated multi-protocol proxy framework. It does not contain malware or malicious routines. Its complexity and plugin support could be exploited if misused, but no evidence of malicious intent exists in the current code. The security risk is moderate, primarily due to external plugin and configuration trust assumptions."
