{
  "purpose": "A comprehensive multi-protocol proxy supporting HTTP, SOCKS, Shadowsocks, QUIC, HTTP/3, SSH, and backward proxies, with dynamic configuration, health checks, and plugin support.",
  "sources": "Network connections, URL fragments/files for auth and cipher configs, external plugin modules, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network data transmission, connection setup, external plugin execution, SSL context creation.",
  "flows": "Input data from network or files → configuration parsing and plugin loading → protocol handling and network communication → optional data exfiltration or backdoor via plugins (not evidenced).",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of libraries, runtime SSL context creation, cipher configs from base64, extensive plugin and protocol support, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a multi-protocol proxy framework with features for SSL/TLS, QUIC, HTTP/2/3, SSH, and dynamic routing. It loads external plugins and cipher modules, supports runtime SSL context creation, and handles multiple protocols with complex network flows. No explicit malicious routines, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's flexibility introduces potential misuse if malicious plugins or configs are loaded, but the core source appears legitimate. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0.3) are consistent with the code's structure and potential attack surface.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, sophisticated multi-protocol proxy framework. It does not contain malware or malicious routines. Its complexity and plugin support could be exploited if misused, but no evidence of malicious intent exists in the current code. The security risk is moderate, primarily due to external plugin and configuration trust assumptions.",
