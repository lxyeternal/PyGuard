  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues are present, evaluate the reasoning, and adjust scores if necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard CORS implementation; no malicious code or obfuscation; headers are set based on regex matching.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical CORS setup. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The reasoning is sound, and the logic is straightforward. The low risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard CORS middleware; no malicious code or obfuscation; headers set based on regex resource matching.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; no suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The reasoning is correct, and the code appears safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** CORS class wrapping response and exception handlers; standard header setting; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The code's pattern of wrapping exception handlers to ensure headers are present during errors is common and safe. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard CORS resource matching and header setting; no suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The code is typical for CORS management, with no malicious behavior. The very low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—matching request paths, setting headers, wrapping exception handlers; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** All observations align with a standard, safe implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the standard nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical CORS middleware implementation for Flask.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- The use of regex for resource matching and header setting is standard.\n- Wrapping exception handlers to maintain headers during errors is a common pattern.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly configuration-based, standard behavior)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no indications of malware or security risks beyond normal configuration considerations.",
