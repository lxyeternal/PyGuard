{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Flask extension for managing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies. It matches request paths against configured regex patterns to set appropriate CORS headers, and wraps exception handlers to preserve headers during errors.",
  "sources": "Request path from Flask's request object, resource regex patterns from configuration, and headers set via set_cors_headers based on matching resource options.",
  "sinks": "set_cors_headers function modifies response headers; request.path is used as input for matching; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Normalized request path (unquote_plus(request.path)) flows into try_match against resource regex patterns; upon match, set_cors_headers is invoked to modify response headers accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. The code follows standard patterns for CORS handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of CORS middleware for Flask. It uses regex-based resource matching, header setting, and exception handler wrapping to ensure headers are preserved during errors. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The resource options are configurable and do not contain suspicious logic. The overall data flow is controlled and predictable, with no external network activity or data exfiltration. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of CORS management in Flask, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with its behavior, and no modifications are necessary.",
