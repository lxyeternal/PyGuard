  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the validity of the given scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages CORS headers based on regex resource patterns; no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The logic is standard for CORS middleware; no suspicious activity.\n- The low security risk score (0.2) aligns with the code's purpose—headers management, not data processing.\n- Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior.\n- Obfuscation is not present.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard CORS setup with regex resource matching; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's function.\n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The risk score is appropriate given the header manipulation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** CORS setup with resource matching, wrapping exception handlers; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Wrapping exception handlers is a common pattern, not suspicious.\n- No malware or obfuscation detected.\n- The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard CORS middleware; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Slightly lower risk score (0.1) is justified, as the code is purely header management.\n- No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard CORS handling with regex matching; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is consistent.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or suspicious external activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's functionality—headers management, no malicious code or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the minimal security concern of header manipulation without any malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — very low, as the code handles headers based on configuration, typical for CORS middleware.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' assessments are consistent with the code. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of CORS middleware for Flask, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
