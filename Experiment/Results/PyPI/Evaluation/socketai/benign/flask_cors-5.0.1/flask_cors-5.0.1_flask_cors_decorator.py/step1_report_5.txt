{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Flask decorator for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on Flask routes, allowing configuration of origins, headers, methods, and credentials.",
  "sources": "Code reads configuration options from function parameters and request data; accesses current_app and request objects; calls get_cors_options and set_cors_headers functions; uses make_response and current_app.make_default_options_response.",
  "sinks": "Response object resp, where CORS headers are set via set_cors_headers; potentially modifies response based on request method and options.",
  "flows": "Source: decorator parameters and request data -> get_cors_options and request method -> Response object -> set_cors_headers modifies response headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard Flask decorator wrapping and CORS handling. Uses update_wrapper for proper decorator behavior. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard Flask CORS decorator with configurable options. It intercepts OPTIONS requests and applies CORS headers accordingly. The use of get_cors_options and set_cors_headers suggests configurable behavior, but these functions are imported and their implementations are not provided; assuming they handle options securely. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are present. The code does not perform network operations or access sensitive data beyond request headers, and it follows standard patterns for CORS handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a Flask CORS decorator with configurable options. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. It simply manages CORS headers in a typical and expected manner.",
