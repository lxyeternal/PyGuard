{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator for Flask routes to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) headers based on configurable options.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include Flask request object for HTTP method and current_app for app context; decorator parameters for CORS options.",
  "sinks": "Response object where CORS headers are set via set_cors_headers; Flask response creation and modification.",
  "flows": "Request method from 'request.method' flows into conditional logic for OPTIONS requests; decorator parameters influence header setting; response object is modified with CORS headers before returning.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors detected. The code simply manages CORS headers in a configurable way; no external connections, data leaks, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Flask decorator 'cross_origin' that wraps route functions to add CORS headers based on supplied options. It logs enabling info, manages OPTIONS method handling, and modifies the response with appropriate headers via set_cors_headers. The logic is standard for CORS management. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations is present. Use of get_cors_options and set_cors_headers appears to be intended for flexible CORS configuration, not malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask CORS decorator implementation with configurable options. It performs expected operations to set CORS headers and handle OPTIONS requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears safe and benign.",
