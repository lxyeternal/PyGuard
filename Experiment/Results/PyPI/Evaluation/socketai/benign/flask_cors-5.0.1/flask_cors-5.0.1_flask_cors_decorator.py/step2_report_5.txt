  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard Flask decorator for handling CORS.\n- It relies on external functions `get_cors_options` and `set_cors_headers`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The code handles OPTIONS requests properly.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are detected in the code.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** Both are correctly scored as 0.\n- **Security risk:** Scores are low (~0.2), which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code's purpose is to manage CORS headers based on configurable options.\n- It uses Flask's response mechanisms correctly.\n- External functions (`get_cors_options`, `set_cors_headers`) are assumed safe, as no evidence suggests otherwise.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity, such as data exfiltration or code injection, is present.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting the minimal risk inherent in CORS handling if misconfigured, but not malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent with the code.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed based on the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.2** (due to potential misconfiguration, not malicious intent)\n\nThis code is a typical, well-implemented Flask CORS decorator with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is justified, considering potential misconfigurations, but not malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues present.  \n- Scores are appropriate.  \n- The code is safe and benign.",
