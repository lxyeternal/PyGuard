  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external calls, and no security-sensitive operations. It is a standard practice for Python packages to include such a version variable. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version identifier with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
