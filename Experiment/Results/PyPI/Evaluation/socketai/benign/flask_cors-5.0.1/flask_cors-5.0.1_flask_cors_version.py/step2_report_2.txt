  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no signs of input handling, data flow, or suspicious operations.\n   - The code is minimal, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated = 0`\n     - `malware = 0`\n     - `securityRisk = 0`\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores:**\n   - Since the code is a simple version string assignment with no malicious behavior, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct; there's no malicious activity.\n   - The reports are consistent in this regard.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the observable code.\n   - No overreach in their security assessment.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores and conclusions are consistent across all reports.\n   - The assessments are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, static version assignment with no input, output, network activity, or suspicious constructs. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this is a benign, straightforward version declaration. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
