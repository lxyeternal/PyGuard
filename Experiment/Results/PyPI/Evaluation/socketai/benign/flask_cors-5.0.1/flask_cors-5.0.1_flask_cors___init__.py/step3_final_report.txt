  "purpose": "This code initializes the package by importing internal modules, setting up __all__, and configuring logging to prevent warnings and set default log level.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.decorator, .extension, .version), setting up logging handlers and levels",
  "sinks": "Logging output, no untrusted data or external connections",
  "flows": "Import statements and logging configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward initialization code with standard logging setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports internal modules, defines __all__, and sets up a NullHandler for logging to avoid warnings. It then checks if the logger level is NOTSET and sets it to WARN if so. There are no untrusted inputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code is typical for a Python package's __init__.py, focusing on safe logging practices. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization with safe logging configuration. No malicious or security issues are detected, and the scores reflect this accurately.",
