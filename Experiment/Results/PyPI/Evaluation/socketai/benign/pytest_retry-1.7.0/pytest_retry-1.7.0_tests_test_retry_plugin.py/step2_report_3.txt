  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states that the code is a set of pytest tests for retry and flaky test handling, sourcing data from fixtures, command-line args, and config files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flows or external data leaks are identified; the flow is standard for pytest tests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or obfuscated code; straightforward test code.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, intended for testing a pytest plugin, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focused on testing pytest plugin behavior.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous data flows; no external or untrusted data processed maliciously.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code; standard pytest test suite.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, safe, and solely for plugin validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (slightly above zero but still very low). This is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a comprehensive pytest test suite for retry features.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow; mainly test execution and outcome assertions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious code; standard testing code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The very low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on pytest retry testing, configuration, and reporting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious code; pure testing logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely testing code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns well with the content.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing pytest-retry and related plugins.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious code; standard test suite.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Estimations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly indicate 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, matching the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (0 or 0.2), appropriate for test code that doesn't pose security risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose.\n- No adjustments needed; the assessments are aligned with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, well-structured pytest test suite aimed at verifying retry and flaky test handling, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
