{
  "purpose": "Define a class for managing default configuration options for pytest tests, including loading from pytest configuration and preventing manual modification.",
  "sources": "Configuration inputs via pytest.Config (load_ini and configure methods)",
  "sinks": "Assignments to internal _opts dictionary, potentially modifying defaults based on configuration",
  "flows": "Configuration data from pytest to internal _opts, mainly via load_ini and configure methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Use of string keys for configuration, typical for config management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for handling default configurations with controlled access. It loads configuration values from pytest's ini options and command line options, converting types as needed. It also prevents manual modification of defaults except through add(), which enforces existing key constraints. The code uses standard Python features and pytest APIs, with no suspicious behaviors, malicious logic, or obfuscated code. It mainly manages configuration options securely without exposing sensitive data or executing untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration management utility for pytest, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It handles configuration safely and effectively without risky patterns.",
