{
  "purpose": "This code manages default configuration options for pytest test retries, including loading options from pytest configuration files.",
  "sources": "Configuration values retrieved via `config.getini()` and `config.getoption()` calls, which may include user-provided values from pytest command line or ini files.",
  "sinks": "Assignments to the `_opts` dictionary, which influence retry behavior; no direct data leaks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from pytest config inputs through `load_ini()` and `configure()` methods into the internal `_opts` dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of `__setattr__` to prevent manual modification appears standard. No malicious patterns or backdoors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class `_Defaults` that encapsulates default configuration parameters for pytest retries. It loads configuration data from pytest config files and command line options, converting string ini values to appropriate types. The class prevents manual modification of defaults through `__setattr__` and controls configuration via dedicated methods. No external network access, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code structure appears typical for a configuration handler with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration handler for pytest retries with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It safely manages user inputs and internal defaults without leaking data or executing harmful actions.",
