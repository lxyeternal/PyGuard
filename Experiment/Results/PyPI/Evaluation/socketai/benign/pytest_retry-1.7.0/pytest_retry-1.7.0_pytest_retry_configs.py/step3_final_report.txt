  "purpose": "Manage pytest default configuration options such as retries, delay, timing, and outcomes, ensuring safe and consistent handling of these settings.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from pytest.Config via getini() and getoption() methods.",
  "sinks": "Updates internal _opts dictionary with configuration values, influencing pytest behavior.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from pytest.Config into _opts through load_ini() and configure() methods, with type conversions and safeguards.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration handler that safely loads and manages pytest retry and timing options. It converts string inputs to appropriate types, enforces safeguards against manual overwrites, and does not include any obfuscated or malicious code. All interactions are limited to internal data structures and standard pytest API calls. No network activity, external communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The logic is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical plugin configuration patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration utility for pytest with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It maintains safe handling of configuration data and enforces restrictions against manual modifications, making it suitable for supply chain use without security concerns.",
