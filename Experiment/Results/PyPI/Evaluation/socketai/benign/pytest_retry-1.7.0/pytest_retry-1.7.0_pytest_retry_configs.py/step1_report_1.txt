{
  "purpose": "The code defines a configuration management class for handling default settings in pytest, specifically for retry logic and related options.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from pytest.Config object via getini() and getoption() methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data handling; only modifies internal configuration state.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from pytest.Config to internal _opts dictionary during load_ini() and configure() methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code present. No suspicious network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages configuration options with safeguards against manual overwriting and duplicate addition. It reads configuration from pytest's ini and option interfaces, converting values appropriately. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic identified. The class enforces restrictions on modifying defaults and handles configuration loading cleanly.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration handler for pytest testing parameters, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks observed.",
