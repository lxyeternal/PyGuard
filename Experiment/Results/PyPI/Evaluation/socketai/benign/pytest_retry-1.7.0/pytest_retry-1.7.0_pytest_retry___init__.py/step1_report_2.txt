  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import reads data from the retry_plugin module; exported variables provide access to imported data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three variables from a local module named retry_plugin and makes them available for external use through the __all__ list. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. It is a simple module export pattern with no external data flows or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a basic import and export of variables without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign Python module setup.",
