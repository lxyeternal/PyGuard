  "purpose": "Re-export specific variables imported from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .retry_plugin module",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external outputs",
  "flows": "None; static import and export only",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code imports three variables from a local module and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is simple, transparent, and adheres to standard Python practices. Given the absence of suspicious features or external data handling, the code poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard module re-export pattern with no security issues or malicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with full confidence in this assessment.",
