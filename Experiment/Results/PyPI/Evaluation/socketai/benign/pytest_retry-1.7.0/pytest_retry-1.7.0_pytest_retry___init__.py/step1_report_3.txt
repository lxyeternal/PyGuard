{
  "purpose": "Exports specific keys from the retry_plugin module for external use, likely related to retry logic in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module (.retry_plugin). No external input sources observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no handling of untrusted data or external data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual language features, or obfuscation. The import is relative, which is common in package internals.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific variables from a local module and defines an export list. There are no data processing, external inputs, or output operations. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard, serving as an interface to expose certain variables from a local module. No malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
