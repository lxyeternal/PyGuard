  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, considering the code, logic, and scoring.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple module that imports specific variables from a local module (`retry_plugin`) and re-exports them via `__all__`. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to common Python module patterns.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \nYes. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, no suspicious logic, and no malicious behavior. The code does not process untrusted data, does not perform network operations, and contains no obfuscated or hardcoded secrets.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a benign, standard module re-export pattern.  \n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.  \n- The assessments of security risk, malware, obfuscation, and anomalies are all appropriately low or zero.\n\n4. **Score Justifications**  \n- All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- The scores are consistent across reports and reflect the analysis accurately.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores**  \n- Since the code is purely a static import/export with no malicious or suspicious behavior, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.  \n- The reports' current scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**  \n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly states that there are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.  \n- The assumption that the code is benign is supported by the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**  \n- The code is a standard, benign module for re-exporting constants or keys.  \n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a straightforward module with no security concerns. The current scoring reflects the actual risk profile appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, I concur with the current assessments and scores.",
