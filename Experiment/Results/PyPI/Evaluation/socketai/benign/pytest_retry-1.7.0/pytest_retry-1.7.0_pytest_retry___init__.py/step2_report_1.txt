  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any anomalies or risks are overlooked.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a simple import and export of variables from a local module (`retry_plugin`).\n- No data processing, external input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The import is relative, which is common in internal module design.\n- All reports agree on benignity, with confidence scores of 1 and zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content and logic:\n\n**Original code:**\n```python\nfrom .retry_plugin import duration_key, outcome_key, attempts_key\n\n__all__ = (\"duration_key\", \"outcome_key\", \"attempts_key\")\n```\n\n- This code simply imports three variables from a local module and re-exports them via `__all__`.  \n- There are no functions, no data handling, no control flow, and no external data sources.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is straightforward and aligns with the reports' descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All describe the code as a benign module export pattern.\n- No anomalies, suspicious logic, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Any errors or flaws in the reports?\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n- No report overstates the risk or assigns undue suspicion.\n- The reasoning is sound, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Potential improvements or considerations:\n\n- While the reports are thorough, they could mention that the import is relative (`from .retry_plugin`), which is typical for internal modules but could be misused if the module structure is unusual. However, this does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports are accurate and justified. The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and well-understood.",
