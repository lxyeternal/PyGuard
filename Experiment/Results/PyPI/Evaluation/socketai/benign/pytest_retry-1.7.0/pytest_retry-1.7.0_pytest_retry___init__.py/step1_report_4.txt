  "purpose": "Define and export specific keys related to retry plugin metrics or states.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'duration_key', 'outcome_key', 'attempts_key' from a local module 'retry_plugin'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Import from 'retry_plugin' → exports 'duration_key', 'outcome_key', 'attempts_key'. No data flow involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a straightforward module export; no unusual or suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific identifiers from a local module and then explicitly exports them. It is a minimal module with no logic, control flow, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code. The simplicity and clarity of the code indicate standard behavior for a module defining constants or keys.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that simply re-exports specific keys from a local module. There are no signs of malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
