  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code, then synthesize an overall security stance.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\nThe code is a minimal Python module that imports three variables (`duration_key`, `outcome_key`, `attempts_key`) from a local module `.retry_plugin` and re-exports them via `__all__`. There are no data flows, no external inputs/outputs, no logic, and no obfuscation. It appears to be a simple, benign interface module.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues Reported:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or flaws are evident; the code is syntactically correct and follows standard Python practices.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent in their reasoning, emphasizing the absence of suspicious activity, data handling, or obfuscation.\n- No report makes unsupported assumptions; all conclude benign intent based on the code's simplicity.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign 0 or 0.0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code only re-exports constants and involves no external data or logic, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate.\n- The malware score is also **0**, as there is no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is **0**, given the code's transparency.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns.**  \nNo signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. They correctly identify the code as a simple, safe module export pattern with no malicious or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
