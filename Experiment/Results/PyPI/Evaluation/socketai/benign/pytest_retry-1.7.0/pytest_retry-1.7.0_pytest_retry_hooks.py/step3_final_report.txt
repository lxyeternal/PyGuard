  "purpose": "Defines two pytest hook functions for specifying exception classes to filter or exclude during test retries.",
  "sources": "The functions are placeholders with no actual data input; they contain only '...' indicating incomplete implementation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or execution paths involving external data; the functions are stubs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '...' as function bodies, indicating incomplete scaffolding rather than malicious obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two pytest hook functions with descriptive docstrings, intended to specify exception classes for test retries. Both functions currently contain only '...', serving as placeholders for future implementation. There are no signs of malicious activity, code injection, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The functions are standard boilerplate for pytest configuration, and their incomplete state suggests they are scaffolding rather than malicious or risky code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, incomplete scaffolding with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of '...' indicates pending implementation, not malicious obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores should be 0, reflecting the lack of malicious behavior, with a very low risk score (~0.1) due to incompleteness but no actual threat.",
