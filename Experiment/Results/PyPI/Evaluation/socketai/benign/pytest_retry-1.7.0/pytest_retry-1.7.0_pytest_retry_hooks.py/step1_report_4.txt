{
  "purpose": "The code defines two pytest hook functions intended to specify exceptions to filter or exclude during test retries.",
  "sources": "The functions themselves, which are called during pytest setup to retrieve exception class collections.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the functions return static exception class collections.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ellipses (...) suggests placeholder or incomplete implementation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two pytest hook functions decorated with @pytest.hookspec that return collections of exception classes. These functions are intended for configuring test retry behavior. Both functions are incomplete, indicated by the use of '...' (Ellipsis), which implies they are placeholders or stubs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The functions are straightforward and do not process any input data or execute suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, boilerplate setup for pytest hooks related to exception filtering during test retries. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The presence of placeholder ellipses indicates the code is incomplete but not malicious.",
