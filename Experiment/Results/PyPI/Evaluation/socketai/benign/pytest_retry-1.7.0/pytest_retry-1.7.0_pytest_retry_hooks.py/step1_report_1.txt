{
  "purpose": "The code defines two pytest hook functions to specify exceptions to include or exclude when retrying flaky tests.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; defines functions with static return values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions return static tuples or ellipsis.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder '...' indicating incomplete implementation; no actual exception classes returned or used.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two pytest hook definitions with docstrings explaining their intended behavior. Both functions currently return '...' which is a placeholder indicating incomplete implementation. There are no actual exception classes specified, no dynamic code execution, or any suspicious activity. No external inputs are processed, and no data leaks or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be boilerplate or scaffolding for future implementation, not malicious or risky.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be incomplete scaffold code intended to be filled in later. No suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious intent is detected.",
