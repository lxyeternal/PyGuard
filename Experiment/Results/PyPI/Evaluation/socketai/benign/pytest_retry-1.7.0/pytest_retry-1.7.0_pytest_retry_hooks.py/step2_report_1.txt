  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines two pytest hook functions intended to specify exception classes for filtering or excluding during test retries.\n   - Both functions contain only the placeholder `...` (Ellipsis), indicating incomplete implementation.\n   - The functions are well-documented with docstrings explaining their purpose.\n   - There are no external inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious activities.\n   - The code appears to be boilerplate or scaffolding for future implementation.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.\n   - No data leaks, external network activity, or code injection.\n   - The placeholders suggest incomplete code, not malicious code.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: Given the absence of any malicious activity, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques. The use of `...` is typical in stub code, not obfuscation. So, **0**.\n   - **Risk Score**: Since the code is incomplete and does not perform any risky operations, the overall security risk is minimal. A small score (e.g., **0.1**) accounts for the incomplete nature but does not imply a real security threat.\n\n4. **Any issues in the report's reasoning?**\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, incomplete, and boilerplate.\n   - They appropriately note the placeholders and lack of malicious activity.\n   - No overestimation of risk or malware presence.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion**:\n   - The code is a benign, incomplete scaffold.\n   - No malicious intent or security risks are evident.\n   - The placeholder `...` indicates future implementation, not malicious obfuscation or attack.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (due to incompleteness but no actual risk)\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is safe, non-malicious, and merely a template.",
