{
  "purpose": "Defines pytest hook functions to specify exception classes for filtering and excluding exceptions during test retries.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines functions and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or used.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; functions return static or predefined values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears standard and straightforward. The use of ellipses (...) indicates incomplete implementations, but no malicious behavior is implied.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two pytest hook functions with proper docstrings explaining their purpose. Both functions return nothing (ellipsis), indicating placeholders for user-defined implementations. There are no signs of malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious behavior. The code is benign and intended for test configuration. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard pytest configuration template for setting filtered and excluded exceptions during test retries. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
