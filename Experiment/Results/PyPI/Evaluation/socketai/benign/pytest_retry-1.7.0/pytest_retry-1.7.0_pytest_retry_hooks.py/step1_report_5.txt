  "purpose": "Define pytest hooks for setting filtered and excluded exceptions during test retries.",
  "sources": "The code defines two functions that return collections of exception classes, which are used as filters or exclusions for test retries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external data handling, no data leaks, or effects from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The functions are intended to return tuples of exception classes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ellipsis (...) as function bodies, which indicates placeholder or incomplete implementation, but no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides function definitions with detailed docstrings explaining their purpose in pytest configuration. The functions currently contain only placeholders (...), indicating incomplete implementation. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are typical for pytest customization and contain no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard pytest configuration setup with placeholder functions. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident. The placeholder indicates that the actual implementation is incomplete or deferred.",
