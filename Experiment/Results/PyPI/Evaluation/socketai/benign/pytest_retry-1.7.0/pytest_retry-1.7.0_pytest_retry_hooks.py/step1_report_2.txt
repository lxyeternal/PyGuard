  "purpose": "Define pytest hooks for setting filtered and excluded exceptions during test retries.",
  "sources": "None; all code is defining functions and docstrings without external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks, no external data handling, no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow; functions return static tuples, no dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ellipses (...) used as placeholders; no actual code or logic implementation, but this is typical in stub or template code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pytest hook functions intended to specify exceptions to filter or exclude during retries. Both functions contain docstrings explaining their purpose and provide example usage. The actual function bodies use '...' indicating placeholders or incomplete implementations. No external data input, no code injection, no malicious activity, and no suspicious logic are present. The placeholders suggest this may be a template or incomplete code snippet, not malicious. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a template for pytest hooks related to test retry mechanisms, with no malicious intent. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and the placeholders indicate incomplete implementation rather than malicious code. Overall, it poses no security risk.",
