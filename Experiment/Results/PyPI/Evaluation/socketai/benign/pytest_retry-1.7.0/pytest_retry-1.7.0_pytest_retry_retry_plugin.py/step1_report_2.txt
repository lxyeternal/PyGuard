{
  "purpose": "The code implements a pytest plugin to handle retry logic for flaky tests, including configuration, reporting, and hooks to manage test retries and outcomes.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment and configuration options, retrieves test markers and exceptions, accesses test reports, and interacts with pytest internals.",
  "sinks": "Sends formatted exception traces to the reporter stream, writes output to terminal, and initializes server/client for reporting.",
  "flows": "Code reads test outcome, exception info, and configuration; decides on retry behavior; logs attempts; interacts with external reporter servers; updates test reports and outcomes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. Use of external reporting may be scrutinized but appears legitimate. No network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation of a pytest plugin for handling retries of flaky tests, with robust exception handling, reporting, and plugin registration. It leverages pytest hooks and configuration options without evidence of malicious intent. All interactions are within normal test framework operations. No suspicious behaviors such as data leakage, code injection, or remote command execution are detected. The code relies on pytest's internal APIs and external reporter classes, which are not suspicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, well-structured pytest plugin designed for retrying flaky tests and managing reports. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. The code does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It is safe based on the analysis.",
