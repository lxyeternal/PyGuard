  "purpose": "A pytest plugin managing retries for flaky tests, including exception filtering, reporting, and configuration handling.",
  "sources": "Configuration options, exception filters, test reports, hooks, and external reporting classes (e.g., ReportHandler, ReportServer, ClientReporter).",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, report streams, test outcome modifications, and potential network reporting via external classes.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration and marker data; filters exceptions; manages retries with delays; logs attempts; reports outcomes; communicates with external reporting classes for network reporting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. External reporting classes are used but are standard for reporting purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest plugin for retrying flaky tests, with exception filtering, reporting, and configuration management. No network activity or malicious behavior is evident. External classes are used for reporting, which is typical and does not imply malicious intent. The code is clear, well-structured, and within expected patterns for such plugins.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured pytest plugin for managing flaky tests with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 reflects the use of external reporting classes, but no actual malicious behavior or data exfiltration is present.",
