  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is merely assigning a string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - The original code `__version__ = '1.1.0'` is a standard practice in Python packages for versioning.\n   - No input/output, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all analyses indicate no malicious or suspicious activity, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n   - **Conclusion:** The risk scores are justified as 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and rely on code analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a simple version assignment.\n   - **Conclusion:** No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They align with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Summary & Personal Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a minimal, standard version declaration in Python. It presents no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and their scores are justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe original code is benign, and the scores assigned are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
