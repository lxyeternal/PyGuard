  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the string '1.1.0' to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; static assignment with no external data or input.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is a straightforward version declaration with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent. No anomalies or suspicious signals are present. The code does not interact with external data, perform any I/O, or contain any logic that could be exploited or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
