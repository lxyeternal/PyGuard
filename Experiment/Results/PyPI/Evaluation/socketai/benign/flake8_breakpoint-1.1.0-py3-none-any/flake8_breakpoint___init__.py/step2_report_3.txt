  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code snippet:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = '1.1.0'\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code **only** assigns a string `'1.1.0'` to the variable `__version__`.\n- No input sources, data processing, external calls, or data sinks are present.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5** all state that the code is a simple version assignment with no suspicious or malicious behavior. Their analyses are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues.\n\n### Logical errors or flaws:\n- **No issues detected** in the reports; all are consistent.\n- The reasoning that this code is benign and standard is correct.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- `securityRisk: 0` is correct.\n- `obfuscated: 0` is correct.\n- Confidence scores are high (1), which is justified given the simplicity.\n\n### Any adjustments needed?\n- **No**, the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is just a version string, it **cannot** be malicious or obfuscated.\n- The only potential concern could be if the version string is dynamically generated or fetched from an untrusted source, but here it is a static string, so no risk.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n### Malware score:\n- **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n### Obfuscated score:\n- **0** — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n### Risk score:\n- **0** — No security risk, no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n## Summary:\n- The code is a standard version declaration.\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided reports and their scoring.**",
