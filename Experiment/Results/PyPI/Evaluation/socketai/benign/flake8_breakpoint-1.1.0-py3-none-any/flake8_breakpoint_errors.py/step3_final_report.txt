  "purpose": "Defines static error classes to flag usage of debugging functions and modules in Python code, intended for static analysis tools.",
  "sources": "Import of 'Error' class from 'flake8_plugin_utils'; class definitions referencing 'breakpoint' and debug modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static class definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and intended for static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two static error classes used for static code analysis to detect debugging practices. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The purpose is to warn developers about debugging code, not to execute or harm. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code. Confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The code is standard for static analysis tooling and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended for static analysis purposes. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
