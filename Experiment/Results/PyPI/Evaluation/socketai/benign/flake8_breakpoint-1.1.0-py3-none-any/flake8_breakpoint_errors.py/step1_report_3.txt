{
  "purpose": "Define custom error classes related to debugging or debugging tools in a code analysis or linting context.",
  "sources": "No external data input; the code imports a utility module and defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only defines classes without data processing or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of error classes that detect debugging practices, such as the use of 'breakpoint' or debug modules, could indicate potential debugging or malicious debugging practices, but these are common in development and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility for error reporting and defines two error classes that flag the use of 'breakpoint' and debug modules. These classes are typical in code quality or security analysis tools to warn about debugging practices, which might be undesirable in production but are not malicious per se. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of warning classes related to debugging practices. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, merely flagging the presence of debugging code that might be undesirable in certain contexts.",
