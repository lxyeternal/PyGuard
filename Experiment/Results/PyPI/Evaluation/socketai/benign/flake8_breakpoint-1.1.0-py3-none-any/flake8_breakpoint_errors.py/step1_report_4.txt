  "purpose": "Define error classes for specific code quality violations related to debugging functions and modules.",
  "sources": "Import statement from external package 'flake8_plugin_utils', class definitions, class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only defines error classes without executing or processing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static class definitions with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of explicit error classes related to debugging practices, which may indicate intentional debug code detection, but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility for plugin errors and defines two classes to flag the use of debugging functions ('breakpoint') and modules ('debug module') in other code. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or malicious intent. The code itself is purely structural, intended for static analysis enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static utility defining error classes for debugging practices. There is no malicious behavior or security risk present. It is a benign, purpose-specific implementation.",
