{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom error classes for a linter plugin, specifically to flag usage of debugging functions or modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, string literals, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or output is present.",
  "flows": "N/A; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code detects usage of potentially insecure or debugging-related code: the 'breakpoint' function and 'debug' modules. These are flagged as errors, indicating an intention to warn about debug-related code, not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining two error classes with specific codes and messages related to debugging practices. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The presence of these classes suggests the code is intended to identify debugging code in Python projects. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors or backdoors.\n\nThe code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations. It is purely structural, used for static analysis warnings.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of a linter plugin that detects debugging artifacts. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The purpose is to warn developers about the presence of debugging code in their source files, which is a good practice. No malware or security concerns are identified.",
