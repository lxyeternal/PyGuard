  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for static code analysis related to debugging or breakpoints",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'Error' from 'flake8_plugin_utils'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; classes define static error representations",
  "anomalies": "Presence of error classes indicating detection of breakpoints or debug modules; no malicious code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom error classes inheriting from a utility Error class. One class flags the use of the built-in 'breakpoint' function; the other flags import of debug modules. Both are related to static code analysis for debugging practices. No executable or malicious behavior is present; these are mere definitions. No suspicious data handling or malicious payloads are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for static analysis tooling and contains no malicious intent or malicious code. It merely defines error indicators for debugging practices.",
