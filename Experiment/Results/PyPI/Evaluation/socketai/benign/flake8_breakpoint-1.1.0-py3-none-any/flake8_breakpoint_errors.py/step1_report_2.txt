  "purpose": "Define custom error classes for linting rules related to debugging practices",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'Error' from 'flake8_plugin_utils'",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Use of specific error codes and messages to flag debugging code; no suspicious or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines two error classes inheriting from a utility Error class, each representing a specific linting rule: one for detecting usage of the built-in 'breakpoint' function, and another for importing debug modules. There are no external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The purpose appears to be related to static code analysis for debugging practices. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of error classes intended for static analysis and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
