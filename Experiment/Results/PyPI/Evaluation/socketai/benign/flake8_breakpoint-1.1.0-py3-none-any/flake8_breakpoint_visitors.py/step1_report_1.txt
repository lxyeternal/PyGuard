{
  "purpose": "The code is a static analysis tool to detect usage of debugging functions and modules in Python source code.",
  "sources": "Reading function calls (ast.Call), import statements (ast.Import), and from-import statements (ast.ImportFrom).",
  "sinks": "Error reporting methods, which may flag potential issues if debugging functions or modules are found.",
  "flows": "Source nodes (function calls or import statements) trigger error reporting if they match debugging identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "The code explicitly flags usage of 'breakpoint()' and imports of debugging modules like pdb, ipdb, pudb. No suspicious or malicious activity detected beyond code style enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static AST analysis to identify and report the presence of debugging functions ('breakpoint') and modules ('pdb', 'ipdb', 'pudb') in Python source code. It uses visitor methods to check call nodes and import nodes. No external data input, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The purpose is to enforce best practices by warning about debug code that should typically not be present in production. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are found. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to expected static analysis patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a security-safe static analysis utility focused on detecting debug-related code. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. Its purpose is to flag debug code in Python scripts for cleanup before deployment.",
