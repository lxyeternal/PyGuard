  "purpose": "Detects usage of breakpoint() calls and imports of debugging modules (pdb, ipdb, pudb) in Python source code to enforce code hygiene.",
  "sources": "ast.Call nodes for breakpoint(), ast.Import and ast.ImportFrom nodes for debug modules",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data flow or external effects; purely static analysis)",
  "flows": "Detection occurs during AST traversal; no data flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward detection of debug code, no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code traverses AST nodes to identify calls to 'breakpoint' and imports of known debug modules. It correctly flags these patterns as errors. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is simple, clear, and purpose-driven. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscation scores of 0. The risk scores in most reports are slightly high (e.g., 0.2 or 1.0), but given the benign purpose, they should be adjusted downward. The overall logic and scoring are appropriate, with minor adjustments recommended for risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static analysis utility for detecting debug code, with no malicious intent or activity. Scores should reflect minimal security risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and the security risk score adjusted to 0 to accurately represent its benign nature.",
