{
  "purpose": "This code is a static analysis tool that detects usage of debugging functions and modules in Python code, likely to prevent leaving debugging code in production.",
  "sources": "Reads function calls (ast.Call), import statements (ast.Import), and 'from ... import ...' statements (ast.ImportFrom).",
  "sinks": "Errors are raised if debugging functions ('breakpoint') or modules ('pdb', 'ipdb', 'pudb') are detected, which could be used maliciously to expose debugging info if misused, but here it is for detection.",
  "flows": "Source: Import statements or call nodes for debugging modules/functions. Sink: Error reporting triggered by detection of debug code.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively detects and reports the presence of debugging code; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns beyond standard detection logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'ast' for abstract syntax tree parsing and 'flake8_plugin_utils' for creating a custom plugin. It defines a visitor class 'BreakpointVisitor' that scans for calls to 'breakpoint()' and imports of known debugging modules ('pdb', 'ipdb', 'pudb'). When such code is found, it reports errors via custom error classes. The code's intent is to flag debugging artifacts, which are generally not malicious but could be unwanted in production code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms. The code simply performs static detection of debugging statements.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static analysis plugin designed to detect debugging code. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or pose security risks. Its purpose is to improve code quality by identifying debug artifacts before deployment.",
