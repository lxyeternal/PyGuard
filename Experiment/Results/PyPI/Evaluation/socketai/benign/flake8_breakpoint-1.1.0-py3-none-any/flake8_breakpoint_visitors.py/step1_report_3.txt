{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static analysis tool to detect the usage of debugging features such as breakpoints and imports of debugging modules in Python code.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements and function call nodes in Python AST to identify usage of debugging modules and breakpoint calls.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code; it only reports detected debugging usage.",
  "flows": "The source of data (import statements or function calls) flows into the logic that checks for debugging module imports or breakpoint calls, resulting in error reports.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is straightforward and standard for static analysis. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses AST parsing to detect calls to 'breakpoint()' and imports of known debugging modules ('pdb', 'ipdb', 'pudb'). It registers visitor methods for relevant AST nodes and reports issues when such patterns are found. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is present; it serves as a security tool for code hygiene.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis plugin aimed at identifying debugging code in Python projects. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
