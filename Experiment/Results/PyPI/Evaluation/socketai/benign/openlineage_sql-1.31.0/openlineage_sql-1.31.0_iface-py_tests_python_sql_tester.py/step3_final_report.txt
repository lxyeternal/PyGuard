  "purpose": "A command-line utility to parse SQL statements and display metadata about input/output tables using an external parser.",
  "sources": "Reads SQL input from stdin; optionally accepts a dialect argument via command-line.",
  "sinks": "Outputs metadata to stdout; no untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Input SQL from stdin flows into the parse() function; output metadata flows to stdout for display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a benign CLI tool that reads SQL statements, optionally with a specified dialect, and uses an external trusted library to parse and display table metadata. It performs no network activity, data leaks, or malicious code execution. The code uses standard libraries and benign terminal formatting. External dependency 'openlineage_sql.parse' is assumed trustworthy. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security flaws are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward utility for testing SQL parsing with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
