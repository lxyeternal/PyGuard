{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to interactively test and parse SQL statements, outputting metadata about input and output tables.",
  "sources": "Reads SQL input from standard input (stdin), potentially via piped input or user input.",
  "sinks": "Outputs parsing results and metadata to standard output (stdout). No apparent sinks that leak untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input (SQL statements) -> parse function -> output of metadata info. No external or untrusted data flows outside this process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Usage of colored terminal output is benign. The parse function is imported from a presumably trusted openlineage_sql module, and no code within this script dynamically executes code or accesses sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles user input or piped SQL statements, passing them to an external parser. It outputs formatted metadata about SQL tables. The code uses straightforward input/output operations, with no data leaks, insecure practices, or malicious behavior. There are no obfuscations, suspicious code patterns, or malicious actions detected. The parse function's internal behavior cannot be assessed here, but assuming it is a trusted third-party library, the overall script is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple SQL parser tester that reads input, parses it, and outputs metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues in this code. It appears to be a benign utility script.",
