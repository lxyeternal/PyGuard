{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to test and parse SQL statements inputted by the user, providing metadata about the tables involved.",
  "sources": "User input from stdin, which can be provided interactively or via pipe (e.g., echo or cat).",
  "sinks": "The parse function from the openlineage_sql library, which processes SQL statements; printing functions that display metadata.",
  "flows": "User input (stdin) -> parse() -> print_meta() -> print_table(), displaying table information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Usage of color codes is purely for display purposes. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily reads SQL input from stdin, optionally specifies a dialect, and processes this input with the openlineage_sql.parse function. The parsed metadata is then displayed. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions handle input and output straightforwardly. The only external dependency is openlineage_sql, which appears to be a legitimate library. No suspicious or insecure practices are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a simple SQL parser tester and does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely processes input SQL statements and displays metadata, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
