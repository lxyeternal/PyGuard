{
  "purpose": "A command-line tool for parsing and testing SQL statements using the openlineage_sql library.",
  "sources": "Input from sys.stdin (user-entered SQL statements); command-line arguments for dialect.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is sent to external systems or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "User inputs SQL into stdin -> parse() function processes SQL -> output of metadata details.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and mainly handles input/output.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts SQL input either interactively or piped via stdin, processes it with the openlineage_sql.parse function, and displays metadata about input/output tables. It uses standard libraries (argparse, os, sys) and a custom library (openlineage_sql). No data is transmitted externally or stored insecurely. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. It performs a benign function related to SQL parsing without any side effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign command-line SQL parser testing utility without malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. It is safe based on its current implementation.",
