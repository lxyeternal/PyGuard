{
  "purpose": "A command-line tool to parse and test SQL statements using the openlineage_sql library, providing metadata about SQL input.",
  "sources": "Reads SQL input from stdin, possibly via pipe or direct input; reads command-line arguments for dialect specification.",
  "sinks": "Outputs parsed metadata and SQL content to the console; no untrusted data is written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input SQL from stdin → parse() function → print output and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line utility that accepts SQL input, optionally specifies a dialect, and uses an external parser (openlineage_sql.parse) to analyze the SQL. It then displays metadata about input and output tables. No network communication, no handling of untrusted data beyond display, and no security-sensitive operations like system calls or credential management are present. The code appears to be for testing and demonstration purposes only, with no malicious intent or behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign SQL parsing utility without any signs of malicious behavior or malware. It functions solely to parse SQL input and display metadata, with no evident security risks.",
