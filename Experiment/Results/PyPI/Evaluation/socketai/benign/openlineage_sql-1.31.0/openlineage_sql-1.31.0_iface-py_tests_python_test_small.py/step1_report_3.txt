  "purpose": "Test function for parsing SQL query to extract input tables and output information",
  "sources": "Input SQL string in parse() function call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage points or external communication",
  "flows": "Input SQL string flows into parse(), outputs are checked via assertions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; straightforward test case; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a parsing function from openlineage_sql, defines a simple test that calls parse() with a static SQL string, and asserts expected outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be a standard unit test for a parsing library, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign unit test for SQL parsing functionality with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
