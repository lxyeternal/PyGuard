{
  "purpose": "This code imports a parsing function from the openlineage_sql package and tests its ability to parse a simple SQL query.",
  "sources": "Input data is the SQL query string \"SELECT * FROM test1\" passed to the parse function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; the code only performs a parsing operation.",
  "flows": "The input SQL string flows into the parse function, which processes it to extract metadata, but no data is sent elsewhere or over a network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be a straightforward test case for the parse function without any unusual code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple unit test that calls parse on a static SQL string and asserts expected properties of the returned metadata object. It imports only a parsing library and performs no network or system operations. No hardcoded credentials, malicious logic, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script for a SQL parsing library, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
