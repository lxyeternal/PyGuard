{
  "purpose": "The code appears to test the parsing of a SQL query to extract metadata about inputs and outputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads a string literal containing a SQL query: \"SELECT * FROM test1\".",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems or perform any network operations.",
  "flows": "Input source is the SQL string passed to parse(). No flows to external sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and appears to be a simple test case. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a parse function from openlineage_sql and tests its behavior with a simple SQL statement. It verifies that the metadata extracted contains the expected input and output fields. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or unusual patterns identified. The code is standard for a unit test of a parsing library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script for SQL parsing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
