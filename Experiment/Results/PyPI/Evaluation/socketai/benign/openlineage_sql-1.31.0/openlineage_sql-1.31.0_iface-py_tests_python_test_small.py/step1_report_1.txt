{
  "purpose": "This code is a test function to parse an SQL query and verify the inputs and output extracted.",
  "sources": "The SQL string \"SELECT * FROM test1\" passed to the parse function.",
  "sinks": "The parse function processes input data; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input SQL string flows into parse(), which then determines inputs and outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a parsing function from a module and runs a simple test asserting expected outputs. The test itself appears straightforward, with no dynamic execution or external data collection. The use of a fixed SQL query indicates controlled input, and no malicious activity such as network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test case for SQL parsing functionality with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
