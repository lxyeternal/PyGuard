  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward package init file; no suspicious or unusual code structures or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script sets the version information using a tuple and string formatting, and defines an explicit list of submodules. It contains no input handling, network operations, file manipulations, or other typical malicious behaviors. The code is clean, simple, and standard for a Python package __init__.py file. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
