  "purpose": "Define package metadata including version information and list submodules for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Constants defining version info (__version__, VERSION) and the list of submodules (__all__); no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None present; no handling of untrusted data, user input, or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only sets constants and metadata without data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata definitions, version formatting, and an explicit list of submodules. No input reading, data processing, or external calls are present. It appears to be standard package initialization code without obfuscated or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package, serving to define version info and submodule exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies.",
