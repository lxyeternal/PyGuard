  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward package initialization (__init__.py) file.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The version string is generated via static data and string formatting, which is standard.\n- The __all__ list defines submodules explicitly.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected across all reports.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or external data sources.\n- The version tuple and string are hardcoded.\n- The module list is explicitly defined.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final note:**\n- No changes needed. The code is a standard, safe package initialization script with no security concerns.",
