  "purpose": "Static package initialization (__init__.py) defining version info and submodule exports.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version tuple, string formatting, explicit submodule list.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, data output, or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and standard for package init files.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static __init__.py file setting version info and exporting submodules. No dynamic behavior, external inputs, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's structure and content are consistent with a typical package initialization script, with no anomalies or vulnerabilities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and standard for a Python package __init__.py. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
