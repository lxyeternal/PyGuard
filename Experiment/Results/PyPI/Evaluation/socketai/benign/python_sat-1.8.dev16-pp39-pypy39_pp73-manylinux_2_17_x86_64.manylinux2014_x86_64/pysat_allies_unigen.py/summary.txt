  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-built utility for SAT sampling with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It relies on a trusted external library and performs its functions transparently. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the overall assessment indicates a safe and benign implementation."
