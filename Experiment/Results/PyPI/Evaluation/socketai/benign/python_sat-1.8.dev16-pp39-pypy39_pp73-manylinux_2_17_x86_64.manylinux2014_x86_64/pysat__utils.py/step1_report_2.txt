  "purpose": "Provides a utility class to check if the current thread is the main thread, used for signal handling in other modules of PySAT.",
  "sources": "Imports threading module; uses threading.current_thread(), threading.main_thread(), and threading._MainThread.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions. No external data or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs thread type checking internally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The class is straightforward and has no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple utility class that checks if the current thread is the main thread, using standard threading library functions. It contains standard error handling for compatibility with older Python versions. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The code is purely for thread identification and does not perform network operations, data leakage, or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for thread checking, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use as part of the larger PySAT project.",
