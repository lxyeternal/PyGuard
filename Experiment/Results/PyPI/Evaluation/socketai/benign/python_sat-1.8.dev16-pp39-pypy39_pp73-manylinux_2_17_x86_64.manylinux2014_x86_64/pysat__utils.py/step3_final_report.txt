  "purpose": "A utility class to check if the current thread is the main thread, used for signal handling and encoding in PySAT.",
  "sources": "threading.current_thread(), threading.main_thread(), threading._MainThread (fallback for older Python versions)",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Source functions provide thread identity info; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a static method that checks thread identity using standard threading functions, with compatibility fallback. It performs a benign utility function without external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. The implementation is correct, well-documented, and relies solely on the standard library. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.0, securityRisk: 0.0) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for thread checking with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
