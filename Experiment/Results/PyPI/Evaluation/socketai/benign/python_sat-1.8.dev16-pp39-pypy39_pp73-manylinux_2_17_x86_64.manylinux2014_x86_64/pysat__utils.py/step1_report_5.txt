  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for thread management, specifically checking if the current thread is the main thread.",
  "sources": "import threading; threading.current_thread(); threading.main_thread(); isinstance(threading.current_thread(), threading._MainThread)",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and performs standard thread checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'MainThread' with a static method 'check' that determines if the current thread is the main thread. It uses standard threading library calls with compatibility handling for Python versions before 3.4. No external inputs are processed, and no untrusted data flows are present. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious behavior, and solely performs a utility check for thread identity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for thread checking. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
