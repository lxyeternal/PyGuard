{
  "purpose": "Provide a unified interface for reading and writing files, including compressed files, supporting gzip, bzip2, and lzma compression types.",
  "sources": "File inputs via file name parameters in the constructor and open() method, which read file names and possibly infer compression types from file extensions.",
  "sinks": "File objects created for reading or writing, but no untrusted data sinks or network transmission identified.",
  "flows": "Input file names are used to open files with specific compression types, with flow mainly limited to file opening and closing operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. The code performs standard file I/O operations with support for multiple compression formats. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for handling file operations transparently across uncompressed and compressed formats. It infers compression from extensions when needed, handles various compression libraries, and manages resources properly. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a utility module for file management, with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file I/O utility with support for compression. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and purposefully designed for file handling.",
