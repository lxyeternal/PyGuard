  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of cardinality constraint encodings for SAT solvers. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, contingent on the trustworthiness of the external 'pycard' library. The high confidence scores reflect the code's transparency and standard design."
