  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external files, dynamic code execution, obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, eval()/exec() calls, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via dynamic execution, environment reads, or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious URLs, no definitive malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts, but no concrete malicious payloads or backdoors are confirmed. The suspicion is primarily based on obfuscated patterns and potential for malicious behavior, but lacking definitive evidence. The benign reports lack code details, making definitive conclusions difficult. The scores assigned reflect suspicion levels, with moderate malware and high obfuscation scores justified by observed patterns. Overall, the code does not demonstrate confirmed malicious activity but warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation and dynamic features.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits suspicious obfuscation and dynamic code patterns but no confirmed malicious payloads. The malware risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but overall the package appears benign. Continued monitoring is recommended, especially if runtime behavior reveals further malicious activity.",
