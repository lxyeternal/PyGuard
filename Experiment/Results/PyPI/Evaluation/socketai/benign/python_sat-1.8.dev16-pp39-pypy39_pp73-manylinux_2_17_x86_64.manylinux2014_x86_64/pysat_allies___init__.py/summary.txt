  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits suspicious obfuscation and dynamic code patterns but no confirmed malicious payloads. The malware risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but overall the package appears benign. Continued monitoring is recommended, especially if runtime behavior reveals further malicious activity."
