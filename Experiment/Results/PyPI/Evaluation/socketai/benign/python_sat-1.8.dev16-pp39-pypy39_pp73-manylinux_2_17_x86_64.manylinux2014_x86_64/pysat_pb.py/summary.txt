  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent API wrapper for encoding pseudo-Boolean constraints into CNF formulas. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious elements. The dependency on pypblib is a common practice and does not introduce security risks in itself. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for use."
