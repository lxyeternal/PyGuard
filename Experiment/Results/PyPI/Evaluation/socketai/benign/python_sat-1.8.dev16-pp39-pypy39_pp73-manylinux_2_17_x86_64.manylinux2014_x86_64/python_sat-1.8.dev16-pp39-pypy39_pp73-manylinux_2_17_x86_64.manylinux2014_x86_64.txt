The malware risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but overall the package appears benign. Continued monitoring is recommended, especially if runtime behavior reveals further malicious activity."

The high risk scores in the initial reports are likely due to the potential misuse of the tool, not the code itself. The malware and obfuscation scores should be set to 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.1), reflecting the code's safety and purpose."

It relies on a trusted external library and performs its functions transparently. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, and the overall assessment indicates a safe and benign implementation."
