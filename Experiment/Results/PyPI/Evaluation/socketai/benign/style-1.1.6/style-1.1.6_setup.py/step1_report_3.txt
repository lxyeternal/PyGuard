{
  "purpose": "This code is used for packaging and distribution of a Python project via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports the setuptools module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; setup() does not directly handle user data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from any source to sink; the script simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard practices; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the standard 'setuptools' library and calls setup() with no arguments. This is a common pattern for Python packaging. There are no suspicious or malicious code elements, no obfuscated code, and no external data being handled or transmitted. The simplicity of the code reduces the likelihood of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard minimal setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
