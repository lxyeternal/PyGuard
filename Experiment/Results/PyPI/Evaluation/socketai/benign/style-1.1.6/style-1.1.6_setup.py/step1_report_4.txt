  "purpose": "To define and set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports and calls setup() with no parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there are no untrusted data flows or external effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code simply executes setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs. It does not perform any suspicious actions or include obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setup function from setuptools and executes it with default parameters. This is standard practice for Python package setup scripts. There are no inputs, no malicious functions, and no external communications or data manipulations. The code's simplicity indicates it is a typical setup script with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks detected.",
