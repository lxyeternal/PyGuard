  "purpose": "Provides styled string output with ANSI escape codes for terminal styling.",
  "sources": "Input objects in *objects, style_list for styling parameters",
  "sinks": "String concatenation and ANSI code generation for terminal display",
  "flows": "Objects converted to strings, combined with style codes, output as styled string",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; relies on external style module",
  "analysis": "The code constructs styled strings using ANSI escape sequences, depending on an external style module to enable styling. It processes input objects by converting them to strings and concatenates them with style codes. No network, file, or dynamic code execution occurs. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscation or security vulnerabilities. The only potential concern is if untrusted input is passed into objects, which could result in malicious ANSI sequences, but this is a common and expected risk in styled terminal output. Overall, the code is a benign utility for styling terminal output, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward styled string utility that generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It does not perform any malicious activities, network operations, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to untrusted input handling, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
