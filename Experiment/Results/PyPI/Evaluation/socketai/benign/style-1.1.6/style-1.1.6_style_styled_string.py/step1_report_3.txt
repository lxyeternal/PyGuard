{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom styled string class that applies ANSI escape codes for terminal styling and formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'style_list', 'sep', and 'objects' parameters during object creation.",
  "sinks": "String concatenation in __str__, __add__, rjust, and ljust methods; potential use of self._objects which may contain untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (style_list, objects) through __new__ and __init__, then into __str__ and formatting methods for display output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network or file operations, no obfuscated code, and no unusual dynamic execution. Usage of string join, ANSI codes, and standard string operations are typical.",
  "analysis": "The class constructs styled strings with ANSI escape codes for terminal formatting. It manipulates input objects and style parameters to generate styled output. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code relies on external style and string operations for formatting, which are common. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident. The use of __str__ and string concatenations are safe in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a harmless implementation of a styled string class with no malicious intent. It provides formatting utilities for terminal output and does not include any malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
