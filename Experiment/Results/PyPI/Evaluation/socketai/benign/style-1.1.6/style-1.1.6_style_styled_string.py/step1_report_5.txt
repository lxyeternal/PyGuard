  "purpose": "The code defines a custom string class (_StyledString) for styled text formatting, likely for console output.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the *objects* parameter passed during instantiation, which are converted to strings.",
  "sinks": "String concatenation in __str__ and __add__ methods; usage of ANSI escape codes for styling.",
  "flows": "Input objects are converted to strings, potentially styled, and combined into a formatted string with ANSI codes for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs only text styling and formatting. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The class constructs styled strings using ANSI escape codes, with methods for string representation and padding. The input objects are converted to strings, and styling is applied based on style_list. No external data input, environment variable usage, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be purely for display purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a stylistic string formatter with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely manipulates string output for styling, with no evidence of malware or supply chain threats.",
