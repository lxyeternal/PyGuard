  "purpose": "This code defines a custom string class (_StyledString) that applies ANSI styles to strings and provides formatting methods.",
  "sources": "Input data includes style_list, sep, and objects passed to __new__, __init__, and methods; internal attributes hold style codes and string objects.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs styled strings with ANSI escape codes; no data is sent externally or over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into object construction; string representations include ANSI codes; no external data flow or output beyond string formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. Usage of ANSI escape sequences for styling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The class customizes string creation and styling, handling ANSI codes and string formatting. No external data is fetched, sent, or stored maliciously. The code relies on standard string operations and internal style handling, with no obfuscated or malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a harmless utility for styled string formatting. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
