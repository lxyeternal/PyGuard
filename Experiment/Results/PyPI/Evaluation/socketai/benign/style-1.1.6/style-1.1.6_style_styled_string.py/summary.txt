  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward styled string utility that generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It does not perform any malicious activities, network operations, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to untrusted input handling, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
