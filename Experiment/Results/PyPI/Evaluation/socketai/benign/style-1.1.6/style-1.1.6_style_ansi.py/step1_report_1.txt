{
  "purpose": "Defines a dictionary mapping style names to terminal color and text attributes using tuples of integers, likely for styling terminal output.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within the _styles dictionary; no input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only declares a data structure without executing or applying styles.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is purely a static dictionary definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward static data declaration with no unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a dictionary named _styles that maps descriptive style names (like 'bold', 'italic', 'red') to tuples representing terminal styling codes. These codes are standard ANSI escape sequences used for terminal text formatting. There are no dynamic operations, input handling, or execution logic present. The data appears to be a predefined style mapping, which is common for terminal styling libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, harmless data structure defining terminal style codes. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
