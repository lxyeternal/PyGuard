  "purpose": "Defines a dictionary mapping style names to their corresponding terminal color and style codes for formatting console output.",
  "sources": "The entire code is a static dictionary assignment; no input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output operations, or untrusted data propagation within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The dictionary is straightforward and typical for styling purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of a dictionary defining style names and their corresponding color codes, likely for terminal styling. It does not process data, interact with external sources, or perform any actions beyond static data definition. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign static style mapping for terminal output with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
