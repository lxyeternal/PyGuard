  "purpose": "Define a dictionary of text styles with corresponding terminal escape code tuples for styling terminal output.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are used; the code only defines a static dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or influence system behavior; purely a static data structure.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only initializes a static dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward static data definition.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a dictionary named '_styles' mapping style names to tuples of terminal escape codes. It appears to be part of a styling or formatting library for terminal output. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious control flow. It contains standard terminal styling codes, with no dynamic execution or obfuscated logic. The code is clean, simple, and static.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless static dictionary defining terminal text styles. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
