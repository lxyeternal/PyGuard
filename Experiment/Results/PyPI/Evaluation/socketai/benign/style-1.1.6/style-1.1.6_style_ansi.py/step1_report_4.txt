  "purpose": "Define a dictionary mapping color and style names to terminal escape code tuples for styling console output.",
  "sources": "The entire code is a static dictionary declaration; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code does not process external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is a static mapping without runtime data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a dictionary named '_styles' that associates style names with tuples of terminal escape codes. It appears to be a configuration for styling console output. There are no function calls, data processing, or external interactions. The structure is static, simple, and conventional for defining terminal styling options.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static data structure intended for styling terminal text output. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
