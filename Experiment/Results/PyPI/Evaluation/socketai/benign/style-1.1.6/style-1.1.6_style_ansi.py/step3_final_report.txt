  "purpose": "Static dictionary defining terminal style ANSI codes for styling output",
  "sources": "Hardcoded style name keys with associated ANSI code tuples",
  "sinks": "None; static data with no data flow or external input/output",
  "flows": "None; static data structure, no data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard ANSI style mapping, no obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a static dictionary mapping style names to ANSI escape code tuples, intended for terminal styling. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or execution logic. The style codes are standard ANSI codes, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify it as a benign static data structure, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code poses no security risk and is typical for styling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration for terminal styling with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concern signals. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
