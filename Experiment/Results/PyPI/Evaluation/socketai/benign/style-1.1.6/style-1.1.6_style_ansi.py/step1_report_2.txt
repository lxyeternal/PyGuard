{
  "purpose": "Define a dictionary mapping color/style names to corresponding terminal escape code tuples for styling terminal output.",
  "sources": "The entire dictionary initialization; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data or output data insecurely.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes static mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a static dictionary definition with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary assignment containing style and color mappings for terminal output. There are no external data inputs, no function calls, and no dynamic code execution. The structure and content are consistent with standard styling definitions. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or hidden code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static configuration for terminal styling. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or suspicious activity.",
