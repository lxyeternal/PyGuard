  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting numeric values into duration expressions and managing program sections with specified durations in a quantum programming framework.",
  "sources": "Function parameters accepting numeric values or expressions, type checks, and warnings for deprecation.",
  "sinks": "AST node creation for durations, program state management, no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> type checks/conversions -> AST duration literals or expressions -> program statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated function 'make_duration' with a warning; no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe, standard utilities for handling durations, including conversion functions and a class for duration literals. It performs appropriate type checks, handles negative durations if required, and issues deprecation warnings. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The functions are straightforward and align with their purpose in a quantum programming context. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign utility module for managing durations in a quantum programming environment. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The low security risk score (0.1) and zero malware score are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
