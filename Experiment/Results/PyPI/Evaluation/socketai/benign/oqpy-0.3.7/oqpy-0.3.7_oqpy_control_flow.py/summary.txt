  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of control flow constructs for a domain-specific language, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal. No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary."
