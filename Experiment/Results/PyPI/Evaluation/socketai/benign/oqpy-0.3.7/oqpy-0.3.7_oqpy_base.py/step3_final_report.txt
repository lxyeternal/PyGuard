  "purpose": "Provides classes and methods for representing quantum expressions and converting them into AST nodes within the oqpy framework.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, function parameters, external libraries (numpy, openpulse.ast), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "AST node creation functions, which produce AST expressions for further processing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from expression objects and input parameters into AST node constructors via to_ast methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Use of uuid for cache keys is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of expression classes, operator overloads, and conversion routines for a domain-specific language. It handles data conversion, type inference, and caching without external system calls or network activity. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The use of uuid for cache keys is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent or sabotage. It functions as a standard component for expression handling and AST generation in a quantum programming framework. The low risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.",
