  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports indicate the code is purely import statements and a version string declaration, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - The code is standard for a package's initialization or module setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The reports do not identify any logical flaws or errors. They are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign.\n   - The code structure is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty that the code is safe.\n   - Report 4 has a slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still indicates high confidence.\n\n4. **Potential Issues with Scores:**\n   - The malware scores are correctly set to 0; no reason to increase them.\n   - Obfuscated scores are also correctly 0.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n   - The only point to consider is the \"risk\" score, which is 0 in all reports—appropriate given the evidence.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent with the code content.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Final Expert Estimate:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n   - **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module initialization snippet for a Python quantum computing library. All evidence points to a safe, straightforward import and version declaration, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No changes needed based on the evidence.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that the imported modules themselves are scrutinized in a broader context, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
