  "purpose": "Define module version and import various submodules related to quantum programming components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from oqpy library modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; the code only imports modules and sets a version string.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no processing or data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version string and imports multiple modules from the oqpy package. There are no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward library initialization with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard imports and version declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
