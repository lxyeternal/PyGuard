  "purpose": "Defines classes for OpenPulse hardware variable types (PortVar, WaveformVar, FrameVar) with validation logic.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and validation checks within PortVar, WaveformVar, and FrameVar.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing; purely internal class logic.",
  "flows": "Initialization and validation within class constructors; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward class definitions with standard validation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data structure classes for quantum control variables, performing parameter validation. It does not process external inputs, perform network operations, or execute malicious actions. The validation logic ensures correct parameter pairing but is standard. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is domain-specific and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, domain-specific, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The malware score is correctly 0. The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present. The security risk score should be set to 0.1 to reflect minimal validation-related concern but is effectively negligible. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
