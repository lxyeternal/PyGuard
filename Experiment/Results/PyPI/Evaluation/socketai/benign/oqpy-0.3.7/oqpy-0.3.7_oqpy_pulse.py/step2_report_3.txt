  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines classes for OpenPulse variables (PortVar, WaveformVar, FrameVar). No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified. The confidence is high (0.9), with malware score 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The validation in FrameVar is standard, and no external or malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Score review:** Malware = 0 is appropriate. Security risk = 0 is reasonable. Obfuscated = 0. The overall risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard class definitions, no external data flows, no anomalies.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Score review:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, obfuscated = 0. The confidence is 1, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard class definitions with validation checks. No suspicious code, no external data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The only minor note is the securityRisk score of 0.1, which might be slightly overcautious given the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Score review:** Malware remains 0, which is correct. Security risk could be kept at 0, unless considering the validation logic as a potential vector, which seems unlikely.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity, standard validation, no external interactions.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical data modeling pattern for quantum control variables.\n\n- **Score review:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0, obfuscated = 0. The confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no suspicious behavior, straightforward data class definitions.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, no external data flows, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Score review:** Malware = 0, security risk = 0.1 might be slightly high, but given the code's nature, probably should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior?** No. The code is purely class definitions and input validation for a domain-specific library.\n\n- **Obfuscation?** None detected.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code.\n\n- **Security risk:** The scores are mostly 0, with a few at 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, these should be 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Note:** The slight securityRisk of 0.1 in some reports seems unwarranted; I recommend setting it to 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0                     |\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, domain-specific implementation with no security issues or malicious intent.",
