{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and functions for defining quantum subroutines, externs, and waveform generators within a quantum programming framework, primarily for AST construction, code generation, and annotation management.",
  "sources": "Function signatures, decorators, type hints, and annotations used to build AST nodes and manage code metadata.",
  "sinks": "AST nodes, function call objects, and code representations used internally for code generation; no external system calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-defined functions, decorator parameters, and type hints into AST structures and code models, with no external data or system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard use of reflection and decorators in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for managing quantum subroutines and externs, utilizing AST manipulation, decorators, and type hints. It does not perform any external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution based on untrusted input. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical code generation frameworks. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with its behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and intended for internal code modeling within a quantum programming framework. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
