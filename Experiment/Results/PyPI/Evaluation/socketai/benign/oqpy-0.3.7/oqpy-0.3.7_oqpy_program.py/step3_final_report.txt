{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python module for constructing quantum programs via ASTs, managing variables, control flow, and generating code in OpenQASM/OpenPulse formats.",
  "sources": "User inputs, method parameters, and internal data structures feeding into AST node creation and program serialization.",
  "sinks": "AST nodes, code serialization functions; no external command execution, network calls, or dynamic code evaluation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into AST construction functions, which then produce code representations without executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; code is transparent and domain-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured library for quantum program building, managing variables, and generating code. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic execution of untrusted input are present. The data flow is confined to AST construction and serialization. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The supply chain security risk of this code is negligible. It is a legitimate, domain-specific library with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
