  "purpose": "Defines classes and functions for classical variables and types in oqpy, including type creation, range conversion, and AST translation.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, type functions, random name generation, and input parameters for variable initialization.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of variables and expressions into AST nodes, addition of external declarations and subroutines to the program context.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and class initializations flow into AST node creation and program context updates.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random.choice' for variable name generation; benign in context but slightly unusual for security-sensitive code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, domain-specific library for classical variable management in oqpy. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The use of 'random' is for internal variable naming, not malicious obfuscation. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for classical variable handling in oqpy, with no evidence of malicious intent or security threats. The use of 'random' for variable names is benign. The current security scores are justified and should remain as is.",
