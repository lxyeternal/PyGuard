      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses dynamic import statements, such as 'pip.main' and 'win32com', which are often associated with malicious package installation or system manipulation. The code also attempts to create shortcuts, access environment variables, and manipulate files and directories in a way that suggests it could be used to install malicious payloads, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary code. The obfuscation and use of dynamic imports strongly indicate malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing harmful actions or compromising the system.",
