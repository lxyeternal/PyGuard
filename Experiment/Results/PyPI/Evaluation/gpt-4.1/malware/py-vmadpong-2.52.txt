      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload delivery. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution, especially when combined with the check for a specific file ('tahg') and the silent execution flags, suggests an attempt to run malicious code covertly. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to download or execute malicious content without user awareness, indicating malicious intent.",
