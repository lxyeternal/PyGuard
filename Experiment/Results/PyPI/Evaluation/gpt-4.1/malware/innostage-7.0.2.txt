      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically constructs a URL and fetches its content using an HTTP GET request. It then executes the fetched content as Python code via the exec() function. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows remote code execution, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system. The URL appears to be a specific endpoint ('http://files.inostage.ru/version/check/a'), which could serve malicious payloads, such as malware, backdoors, or other harmful scripts. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious or at least highly unsafe behavior, as it enables remote control or compromise of the host machine.",
