      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is likely designed to download and execute malicious content from a remote server (as indicated by the URL in the decoded command). Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated remote code execution and the silent failure handling strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions.",
