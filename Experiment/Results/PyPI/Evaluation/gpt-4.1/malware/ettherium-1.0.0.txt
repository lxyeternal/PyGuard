      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within an overridden 'install' command. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems ('os.name' == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery or backdoor installation. The obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows further suggest malicious intent, aiming to hide malicious activity from casual inspection.",
