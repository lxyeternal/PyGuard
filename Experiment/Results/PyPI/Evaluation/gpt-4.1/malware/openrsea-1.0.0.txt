      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload embedded within the script. Specifically, it uses the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme to decrypt a payload and then executes it via the exec() function. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code, as it attempts to hide its true intent by encrypting the payload and only decrypting it at runtime, potentially executing arbitrary malicious code without detection. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further suggests an intent to conceal malicious activity. Overall, this code is designed to surreptitiously run malicious code during installation, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior.",
