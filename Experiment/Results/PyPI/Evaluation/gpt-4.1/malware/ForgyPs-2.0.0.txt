      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decrypts and executes hidden code at runtime. It uses multiple layers of encoding, including base64, base32, zlib compression, and Fernet encryption, to conceal its true purpose. The final step involves executing dynamically decoded and decrypted code via `exec()`, which is a common technique for executing malicious payloads such as malware, backdoors, or remote code execution exploits. This behavior indicates the script is designed to hide malicious activities, potentially allowing remote command execution, data theft, or system compromise.",
