      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command string. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package named 'py-adrandget' with potentially malicious intent, possibly to disguise or facilitate further malicious activities. The combination of silent PowerShell execution and obfuscated code strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence.",
