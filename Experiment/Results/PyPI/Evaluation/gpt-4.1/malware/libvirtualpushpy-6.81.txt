      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgn9t9zbu0qmv/Esqeule.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or system compromise. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly legitimate Python package setup, which may serve as a decoy or to avoid suspicion, but the primary malicious activity is the hidden PowerShell execution. Overall, this code exhibits malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden, potentially harmful commands on the host system.",
