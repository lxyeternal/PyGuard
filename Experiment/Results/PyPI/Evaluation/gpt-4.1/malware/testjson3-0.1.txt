This behavior indicates an attempt to download and potentially execute malicious code from an external source during installation, which is a common tactic for distributing malware or malicious payloads. The use of a custom command during setup to trigger remote code execution is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",

This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts that aim to fetch and run potentially harmful payloads without user consent or verification. The code does not include any validation or sandboxing, making it highly risky. Such behavior can be used to distribute malware, backdoors, or other malicious software, posing significant security threats.",
