It performs activities such as: \n- Collecting Discord tokens, MFA codes, and user account details, then sending them to a remote webhook.\n- Extracting stored passwords, cookies, and tokens from browsers like Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, and Edge, and uploading them to external servers.\n- Injecting malicious JavaScript into Discord desktop app files to hijack sessions.\n- Kills Discord processes to prevent detection.\n- Collects system info, geolocation, and user credentials.\n- Uploads files, zips data, and exfiltrates it to external servers.\n- Implements persistence by copying itself to startup folders.\n- Contains functions for exploiting Discord accounts, enabling/disabling MFA, and manipulating user accounts.\n- The code communicates with external webhooks and file hosting services to exfiltrate data.\nOverall, this script is a comprehensive information stealer and malicious tool intended for unauthorized access, data theft, and potential account hijacking, which classifies it as malicious.",
