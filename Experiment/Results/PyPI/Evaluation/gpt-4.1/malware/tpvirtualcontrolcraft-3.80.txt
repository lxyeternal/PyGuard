      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.dropbx.com/s/zgn9t9zbu0qmv/ESQuele.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious intent or to facilitate further malicious operations under the guise of a legitimate package. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with external URL references strongly indicates malicious behavior.",
