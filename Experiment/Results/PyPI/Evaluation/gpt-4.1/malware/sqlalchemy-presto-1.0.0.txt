It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker (the domain 'jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com'). This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves data exfiltration without user consent or awareness, potentially for reconnaissance or tracking purposes. The code does not perform any legitimate installation-related tasks with this data, indicating an intent to secretly gather information from the target system.",
