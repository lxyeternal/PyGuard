It then sends this data to a specified Slack webhook URL without any user consent or transparency, which indicates data exfiltration. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at spying, data theft, or unauthorized surveillance. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function with this data, and the presence of hardcoded webhook URL further suggests malicious intent.",
