      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which can be a tactic to avoid detection or re-execution. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and conditional execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence of malware on the host system.",
