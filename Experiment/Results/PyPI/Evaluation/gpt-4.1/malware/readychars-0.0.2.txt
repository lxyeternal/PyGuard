      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encoded payloads that, when decoded and executed, perform malicious actions. Specifically, it decodes a base64-encoded string which, upon decoding, compiles and executes code that makes HTTP requests to an external server (http://193.42.33.24/inject/1zGPvS8IX6z9sSH) and potentially executes further commands. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code fetched from an external source, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, command and control communication, or data exfiltration.",
