      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a hidden window and the obfuscated command strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code's attempt to run this command without user awareness, combined with the lack of legitimate purpose for such behavior, confirms malicious behavior.",
