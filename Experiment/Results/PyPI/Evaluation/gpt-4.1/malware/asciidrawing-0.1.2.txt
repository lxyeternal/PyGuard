      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious behavior where, during the installation process, it sends a POST request to a Discord webhook URL with the user's home directory path and the current timestamp. This action occurs without the user's knowledge or consent, effectively exfiltrating potentially sensitive information (the user's home directory path) to an external server. Such behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration or reconnaissance, which is malicious. The rest of the code appears to be legitimate setup code for a Python package, but the embedded webhook activity indicates malicious intent.",
