      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches a remote script from an external URL, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows the remote server to run arbitrary code on the host machine, which can include malicious actions such as data theft, system compromise, or installing malware. The use of threading to run this process asynchronously further obscures its activity. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious or backdoor code designed to execute remote payloads covertly.",
