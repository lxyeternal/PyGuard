      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, which can be used for malicious purposes such as data theft, remote access, or further malware deployment. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated class names strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to conceal malicious activity from casual inspection.",
