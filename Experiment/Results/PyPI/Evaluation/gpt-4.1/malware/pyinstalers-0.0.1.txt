      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded payload that, when executed, appears to perform network requests to a remote server (http://20.226.18.203/grab/ry2K1CVRSFa59vT), potentially for command and control or data exfiltration. It also includes obfuscated code that manipulates system or environment variables, and attempts to execute code dynamically via 'exec'. The use of base64 decoding, dynamic execution, and network communication strongly indicates malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or executing arbitrary commands.",
