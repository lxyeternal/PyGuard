      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command string. Additionally, the code attempts to run a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious activities or to facilitate further malicious actions. Overall, the presence of obfuscated code executing external commands and the lack of transparency suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation.",
