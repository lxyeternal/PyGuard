      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely fetches or runs malicious code from an external source. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which suggests persistence or environment checks typical of malware. The presence of such obfuscated command execution indicates malicious intent, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise.",
