      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded PowerShell command that is executed silently in the background without user consent. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently with no window, which is typical behavior for malware trying to avoid detection. The presence of such obfuscated code and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions.",
