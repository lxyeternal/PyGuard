      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code. Specifically, it uses the 'cryptography' Fernet module to decrypt a hardcoded encrypted payload and then executes it via 'exec'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The presence of obfuscated strings and the use of 'exec' on decrypted data strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to hide malicious payloads and execute them without user awareness.",
