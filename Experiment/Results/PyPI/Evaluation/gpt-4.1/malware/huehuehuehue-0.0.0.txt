      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded payload that, when executed, imports the 'socket', 'zlib', 'base64', and 'struct' modules, then establishes a network connection to IP 192.168.252.178 on port 9001. It reads data from this socket, decompresses it using zlib, and executes the resulting code. This behavior indicates remote command execution or data exfiltration, which are typical malicious activities. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as establishing a backdoor or remote control channel.",
