      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing harmful payloads. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly legitimate setup of a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent. This behavior suggests the script is intended to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions without user consent.",
