      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears intentionally designed to hide malicious behavior. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using obfuscated string manipulations. The code attempts to import modules like 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', and executes potentially harmful actions such as creating shortcuts, deleting files, or executing system commands, often conditioned on specific, obscure numeric values. The presence of code that interacts with system components, modifies files, or escalates privileges (e.g., checking for admin rights) indicates malicious intent, likely aiming to compromise the system, install malware, or exfiltrate data while avoiding detection through obfuscation.",
