      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains embedded base64-encoded payloads that, when decoded and executed, perform malicious activities. Specifically, the decoded payloads include obfuscated code that appears to perform network requests to external servers, potentially for command-and-control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. The presence of such encoded payloads, combined with the obfuscation and conditional execution based on environment checks, strongly indicates malicious intent. The code likely aims to establish persistent remote access, gather system information, or execute arbitrary commands, which can harm the host system or compromise security.",
