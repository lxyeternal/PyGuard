      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted string. This behavior allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine without explicit user consent. The use of obfuscation (encrypted payload), conditional execution based on OS, and dynamic code execution are common tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection and compromise system security.",
