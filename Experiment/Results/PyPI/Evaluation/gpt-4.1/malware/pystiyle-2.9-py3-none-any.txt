      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decodes and executes hidden code via XOR decryption. The presence of an encrypted string, combined with the use of 'eval(compile(...))' on the decrypted output, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious instructions. This pattern is typical of malware or backdoors designed to run arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or other harmful actions. The rest of the code appears to be a large, complex library for terminal styling and animation, which is likely used to mask the malicious payload or distract from its presence. Overall, this code is malicious due to its obfuscated, dynamically executed payload.",
