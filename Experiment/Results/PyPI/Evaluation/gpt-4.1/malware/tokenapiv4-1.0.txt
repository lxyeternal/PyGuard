      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious stealer designed to extract sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, account credentials (passwords, cookies), and other personal information from the victim's system. It then exfiltrates this data by sending detailed reports—including tokens, emails, IP address, browser cookies, passwords, and Discord account info—to a remote Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. The script also attempts to gather files from various directories, compresses them into ZIP archives, and uploads them to an external file hosting service, further facilitating data theft. Additionally, it installs required dependencies silently, runs multiple threads to scan browsers, Discord, and other applications, and employs techniques to decrypt stored credentials. All these behaviors collectively confirm that the code functions as a comprehensive info-stealer with malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a hidden malicious behavior: it defines functions that can manipulate the console cursor visibility, clear the terminal, and execute arbitrary shell commands via the System.Command() method. Additionally, the code includes complex, obfuscated functions for coloring and animating terminal output, which could be used to disguise malicious activity or create deceptive visual effects. The presence of functions that can hide the cursor, clear the screen, and run system commands suggests potential for malicious use, such as hiding malicious outputs, disrupting user interaction, or executing harmful commands without user consent. The code appears to be designed for advanced terminal manipulation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes like creating deceptive interfaces or executing unauthorized system commands.",
