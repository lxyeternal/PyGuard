      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download, execute, or perform other malicious activities without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which may serve as a persistence or anti-analysis mechanism. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and the hidden window flag indicates an attempt to conceal malicious actions. Overall, these behaviors suggest the code is designed to perform malicious operations, such as remote code execution or malware download, making it malicious.",
