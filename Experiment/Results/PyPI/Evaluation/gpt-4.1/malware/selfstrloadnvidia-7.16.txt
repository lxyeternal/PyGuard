      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and may perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized connections, or other malicious actions. The presence of such obfuscated code, especially combined with the attempt to hide execution details and the lack of legitimate context, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code's attempt to set up a Python package with suspicious metadata further suggests an attempt to disguise malicious behavior under the guise of legitimate package installation.",
