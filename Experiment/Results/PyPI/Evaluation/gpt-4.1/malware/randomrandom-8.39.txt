The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payload intended to run hidden PowerShell scripts, which can be used for activities such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing persistence. Additionally, the code attempts to perform a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to covertly execute malicious PowerShell commands, making it malicious.",
