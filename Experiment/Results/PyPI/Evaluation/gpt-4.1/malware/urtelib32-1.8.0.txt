      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior that involves downloading an image file from a remote server, decoding its contents as base64, and printing the decoded data. This activity suggests an attempt to exfiltrate data or execute hidden payloads. Additionally, the script attempts to elevate privileges to administrator level without user consent, which is a common tactic in malicious software to gain higher system access. The combination of privilege escalation, remote data retrieval, and decoding indicates malicious intent, potentially for covert data exfiltration or executing malicious payloads.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches a script from a remote server and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows the remote server to run arbitrary code on the client machine, which can lead to various malicious activities such as data theft, system compromise, or installing malware. The use of a non-standard URL and custom headers further suggests an attempt to obfuscate or hide the malicious intent. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious or potentially harmful code designed to execute remote payloads.",
