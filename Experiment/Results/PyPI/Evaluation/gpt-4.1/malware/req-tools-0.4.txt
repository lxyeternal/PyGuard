      "malicious_behavior": "The code functions as a remote access trojan (RAT) with multiple malicious capabilities. It establishes a persistent connection to a command-and-control server, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, capture screenshots, browse files, upload/download files, lock or shut down the system, disable Task Manager, and run keylogging. It also attempts to persist by copying itself to the startup folder. Additionally, it can extract stored Chrome passwords and detect sandbox or virtual machine environments to evade analysis. These behaviors collectively enable unauthorized control, data theft, system manipulation, and stealthy operation, confirming its malicious intent.",
