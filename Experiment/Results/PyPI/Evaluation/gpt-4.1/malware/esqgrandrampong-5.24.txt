      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute arbitrary or malicious code remotely or locally, which is characteristic of malware or malicious activity. Additionally, the code's use of obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as legitimate setup scripts typically do not include such behavior.",
