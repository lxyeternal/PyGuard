      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload delivery. The encoded command, when decoded, probably downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL in the base64 string). Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup() call for a package named 'selfgrandminepep', but this appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious activity. The use of hidden subprocess execution with encoded commands is a common tactic in malware to evade detection and execute malicious payloads silently. Therefore, the script contains malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden, potentially harmful code from an external source.",
