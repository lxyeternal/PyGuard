      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and runs in a hidden window, indicating an intent to operate covertly. Although the specific payload is obfuscated, such behavior suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the silent failure handling strongly indicates malicious behavior.",
