      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via the Fernet encryption scheme. Specifically, during the installation process, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts a payload, and executes it dynamically with 'exec()'. This behavior indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads within the package setup, potentially allowing remote code execution or malware installation during the package installation process. The obfuscation of variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of code during setup strongly suggest malicious intent.",
