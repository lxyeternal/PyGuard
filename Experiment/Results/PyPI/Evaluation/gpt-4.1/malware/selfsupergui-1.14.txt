      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely fetches or runs malicious code from an external source. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may be a decoy or part of a social engineering tactic. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and the lack of legitimate context strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious payloads.",
