      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears intentionally designed to conceal malicious behavior. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor activity. The use of heavily encoded, meaningless variable names, and complex bitwise operations strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Specifically, it can execute system-level operations such as creating shortcuts, deleting files, or executing payloads without clear indication of benign purpose. Overall, the code is malicious, aiming to perform covert operations on the host system, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.",
