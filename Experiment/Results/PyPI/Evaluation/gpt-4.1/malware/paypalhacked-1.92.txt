      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is executed with a hidden window. This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts that aim to run obfuscated or malicious commands silently in the background. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly benign Python package setup, which may serve as a decoy or to avoid suspicion, but the primary concern is the hidden PowerShell execution, indicating malicious intent.",
