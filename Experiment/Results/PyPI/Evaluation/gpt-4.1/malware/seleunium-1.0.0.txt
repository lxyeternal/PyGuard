      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code. Specifically, it uses the 'fernet' library to decrypt a hardcoded encrypted payload and then executes it via 'exec'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary malicious code during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. The presence of obfuscated strings and the conditional execution only on Windows further suggests malicious intent to target specific environments while hiding the payload's true purpose.",
