      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or download/execute further payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears legitimate but is likely a cover for the malicious activity. The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command and the silent execution with hidden window flags strongly indicate malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware download.",
