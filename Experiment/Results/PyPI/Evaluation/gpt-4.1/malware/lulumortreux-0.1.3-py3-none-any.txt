      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer (trojan) designed to extract sensitive user data from infected systems. It performs several malicious actions, including: \n\n- Collecting Discord tokens, user account information, email, phone number, badges, billing info, and high-value friends, then exfiltrating this data via a Discord webhook.\n- Extracting stored passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) by copying their local databases, decrypting stored credentials using Windows Data Protection API, and sending the data to the attacker's server.\n- Searching user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files containing keywords related to passwords, accounts, crypto wallets, and other sensitive info, then uploading and reporting these files.\n- Zipping and uploading various application data, including wallet files, game data, and other potentially valuable files.\n- Using threading to perform multiple data collection and upload tasks concurrently.\n- Installing missing Python modules silently.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to stealthily harvest a wide range of personal and account data, then send it to an attacker-controlled webhook, which is characteristic of malicious spyware or info-stealing malware.",
