      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads covertly. The encoded command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform harmful actions like installing malware, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder analysis. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with silent failure handling strongly suggests malicious intent.",
