      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zbu' embedded in the base64 string). Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious package installation. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with external URL references indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or malware download.",
