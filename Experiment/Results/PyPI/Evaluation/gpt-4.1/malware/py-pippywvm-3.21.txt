      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely designed to perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a seemingly obfuscated command indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hinder detection and debugging. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious activity aimed at compromising the system or executing unauthorized commands.",
