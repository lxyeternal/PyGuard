      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes hidden code fetched from an external source using the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery or backdoor installation. The obfuscated strings and the use of external requests to fetch and execute code strongly suggest malicious intent, as it can be used to compromise the target system or perform unauthorized actions.",
