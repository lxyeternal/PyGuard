      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 that is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the PowerShell command. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package with misleading or benign metadata, which may serve as a cover for malicious activities such as persistence, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. The use of try-except blocks to suppress errors further suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior from detection. Overall, the code exhibits typical traits of malicious scripts designed to execute hidden commands and potentially compromise the system.",
