It collects these files, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and then sends the archive to a remote Discord webhook URL. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it aims to secretly gather and transmit potentially sensitive user data without consent, which can be used for account hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious activities.",

This behavior indicates data exfiltration, as it secretly collects potentially sensitive user data stored in the 'Exodus' directory and transmits it to an attacker-controlled server without user consent.

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to covertly extract sensitive user data from various sources, such as web3 wallets, Discord tokens, and Telegram credentials, by importing and executing functions like 'find_tokens', 'yea', 'runner', 'machineinfo', 'sikrinsat', and 'telegram'. These functions likely perform credential harvesting, screen capturing, and system information gathering without user consent. The use of multiple try-except blocks with silent exception handling suggests an attempt to avoid detection and ensure continuous execution, which is characteristic of malicious payloads. Overall, the code's behavior aligns with typical credential stealer or remote access trojan (RAT) activities.",

It searches for tokens matching specific regex patterns in local storage files, collects these tokens, and then exfiltrates them to an external Discord webhook URL. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it aims to harvest user credentials without consent and send them to an attacker-controlled server, potentially enabling account hijacking, identity theft, or further malicious activities.",
