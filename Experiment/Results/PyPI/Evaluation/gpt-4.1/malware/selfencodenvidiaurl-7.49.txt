      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads from external sources (e.g., 'www.esquelesquad.rip' as indicated in the comment). Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious activity or establish persistence. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing backdoors, or executing arbitrary code without user consent.",
