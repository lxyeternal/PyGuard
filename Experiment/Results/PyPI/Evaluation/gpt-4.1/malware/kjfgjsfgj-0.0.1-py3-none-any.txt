      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious information stealer (trojan) designed to extract sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n1. **Credential and Data Harvesting:**\n   - Extracts stored passwords, cookies, and tokens from popular browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) by copying their local databases, decrypting stored credentials, and parsing log files.\n   - Retrieves Discord tokens, user profile info, billing info, badges, and friends via Discord API endpoints.\n   - Extracts tokens from specific files and decrypts them.\n   - Gathers data from messaging apps like Telegram.\n\n2. **File and Data Exfiltration:**\n   - Searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files matching certain keywords (e.g., passwords, accounts, crypto wallets, tokens).\n   - Compresses found files and directories into ZIP archives.\n   - Uploads these archives to anonymous file hosting services (Gofile, Anonfiles) and sends download links via Telegram.\n   - Collects and uploads browser extension data, wallet files, and other sensitive files.\n\n3. **Credential and Token Validation:**\n   - Checks validity of extracted tokens by making API requests.\n   - Gathers additional user info from Discord and other services.\n\n4. **Stealth and Persistence:**\n   - Attempts to install dependencies silently.\n   - Kills processes related to targeted applications before accessing files.\n   - Sends all collected data to a Telegram bot, effectively exfiltrating user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files.\n\nOverall, this code is a comprehensive info-stealer designed to compromise user accounts, steal sensitive data, and exfiltrate it covertly. It is unequivocally malicious.",
