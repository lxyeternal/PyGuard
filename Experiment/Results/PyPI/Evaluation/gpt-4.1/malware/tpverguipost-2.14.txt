      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package distribution. The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to download, execute, or establish persistence for malware, exfiltrate data, or perform other harmful actions.",
