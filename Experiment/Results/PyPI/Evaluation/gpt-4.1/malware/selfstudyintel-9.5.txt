      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears legitimate but may be used as a cover for malicious activities. Overall, the presence of hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands indicates malicious intent.",
