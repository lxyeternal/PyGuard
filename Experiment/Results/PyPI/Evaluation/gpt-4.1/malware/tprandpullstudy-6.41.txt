      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may be used to disguise or facilitate malicious activities. Overall, the presence of obfuscated command execution indicates malicious intent.",
