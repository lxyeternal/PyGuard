      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is likely designed to download and execute malicious content from a remote server (as indicated by the URL in the encoded command). Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
