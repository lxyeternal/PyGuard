      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute arbitrary code during installation, which is a common tactic in malicious packages to run malicious scripts or payloads without user awareness. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows further suggests malicious intent, as it aims to hide its true behavior and target specific environments.",
