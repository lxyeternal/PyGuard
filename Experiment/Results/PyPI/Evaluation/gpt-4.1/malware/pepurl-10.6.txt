      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which runs silently in the background. This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts that aim to execute hidden or obfuscated commands, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious payloads without user awareness. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, and the use of such obfuscation techniques indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and further conceal malicious activity.",
