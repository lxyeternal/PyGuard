      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, which can compromise the system's security. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, making detection and debugging difficult. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and conditional execution based on file existence are common tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection and persist on infected systems.",
