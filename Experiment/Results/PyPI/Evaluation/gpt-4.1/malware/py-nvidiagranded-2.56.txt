      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download, execute, or perform other malicious activities without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only runs the malicious PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or prevent repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and the hidden window flag indicates malicious intent to run potentially harmful scripts covertly. Overall, this behavior is characteristic of malware or backdoor activity designed to compromise the system.",
