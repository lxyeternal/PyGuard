      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely fetches or runs malicious code from an external source. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears legitimate on the surface but may be used as a cover for malicious activities, especially considering the embedded PowerShell command. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden or malicious payloads on the host system.",
