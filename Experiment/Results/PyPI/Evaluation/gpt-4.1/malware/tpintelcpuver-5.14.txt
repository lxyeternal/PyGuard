      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or payloads silently on the target system. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, indicating an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote control, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities.",
