      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs covert data exfiltration by collecting system information such as hostname, username, IP addresses, current working directory, and directory structure. It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious domain (https://425a2.rt11.ml). Additionally, it constructs a DNS query with encoded information, likely to leak data through DNS requests. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious activity aimed at stealthily gathering and transmitting sensitive system data to an attacker-controlled server.",
