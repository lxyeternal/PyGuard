      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package named 'maskget', but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence of malicious payloads. Overall, the script exhibits behavior typical of malware, including obfuscated command execution and stealthy operation.",
