      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, as suggested by the presence of a URL-like string within the base64 payload. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package named 'visamine' with specific metadata, which appears legitimate but could be used as a cover for malicious activities such as installing backdoors or persistence mechanisms. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution and package setup strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence.",
