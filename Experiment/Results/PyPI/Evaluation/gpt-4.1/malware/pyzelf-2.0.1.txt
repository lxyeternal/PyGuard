      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an embedded base64-encoded payload that, when decoded and executed, attempts to run obfuscated JavaScript code via the Windows Script Host (WSH). This script appears to be designed to load additional malicious scripts or payloads from remote servers, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or malware installation. The obfuscation and use of dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to hide its true purpose and evade detection. Overall, this code is malicious, as it covertly executes potentially harmful scripts and communicates with external servers for malicious purposes.",
