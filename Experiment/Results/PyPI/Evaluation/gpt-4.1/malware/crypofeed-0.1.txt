      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that serve no legitimate purpose, such as convoluted string and bytecode manipulations, dynamic imports, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations. It appears designed to hide malicious activities, including executing system commands, installing or updating packages via pip, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files or directories. The presence of code that interacts with Windows-specific APIs (e.g., win32com, ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin) and functions like os.makedirs, os.path.expanduser, os.path.basename, os.path.exists, and os.path.expanduser indicates potential malicious intent to modify system state, escalate privileges, or execute payloads covertly. The extensive use of dynamic code generation, obfuscation, and conditional execution based on obscure calculations strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at stealthy system compromise or persistence.",
