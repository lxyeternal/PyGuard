      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download, execute, or perform other malicious activities without user awareness. Additionally, the code silently ignores exceptions, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent, especially since it is triggered only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, suggesting a conditional payload or persistence mechanism.",
