      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload, when decoded, likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious files, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a seemingly obfuscated command indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run setup for a package named 'selfvirtualloadrand' with a seemingly benign description, which may serve as a decoy or to avoid suspicion. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious payloads silently.",
