      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious code. The encoded command, when decoded, probably downloads or executes malicious payloads from external sources (e.g., 'dl.droppbx.com') without user consent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which is a common anti-analysis or anti-debugging technique. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional payload delivery indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, data theft, or malware installation.",
