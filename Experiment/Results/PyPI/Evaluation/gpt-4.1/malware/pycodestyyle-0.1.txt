      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, manipulating environment variables, and traversing directories—all with convoluted logic and obfuscated variable names. The presence of code that interacts with system internals (e.g., win32com, ctypes, os functions like makedirs, basename, Save, and close) suggests attempts to modify or access system files, potentially for malicious purposes such as persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The heavy obfuscation and use of dynamic code generation strongly indicate malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and perform harmful operations covertly.",
