      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious custom installation class that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes hidden code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The use of obfuscated strings, encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at compromising the target system.",
