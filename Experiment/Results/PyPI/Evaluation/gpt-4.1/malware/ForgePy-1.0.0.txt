      "malicious_behavior": "This code performs multiple layers of obfuscation and encryption to conceal its true intent. It decrypts and decodes data using a Fernet symmetric key, then dynamically executes the resulting code via `exec()`. The embedded data and the process suggest it is designed to run malicious payloads, such as installing malware, establishing backdoors, or executing arbitrary commands on the host system. The use of reverse string operations, base64, base32, zlib compression, and marshaling further indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis. Overall, this code is malicious, aiming to execute hidden, potentially harmful actions on the compromised system.",
