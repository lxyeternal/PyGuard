      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious payloads or activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with obfuscated payload strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing backdoors, or performing other harmful actions. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command indicates malicious behavior.",
