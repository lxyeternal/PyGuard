      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with base64 encoding, string manipulations, and dynamic evaluation (eval). It appears to decode and execute hidden payloads, likely malicious, by reconstructing code at runtime. The code's structure suggests it is designed to conceal its true intent, which is characteristic of malware or backdoor scripts. It may perform actions such as downloading, executing, or manipulating system files, or establishing remote control, all without user consent. The use of eval, base64 decoding, and dynamic code execution strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at evading detection and executing harmful operations.",
