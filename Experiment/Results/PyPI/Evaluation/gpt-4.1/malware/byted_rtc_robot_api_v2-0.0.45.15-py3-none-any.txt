This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The external server URL appears obfuscated or intentionally crafted to hide its true purpose, further suggesting malicious intent. Such behavior can be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or preparing for further malicious actions.",
