      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with the window hidden, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other harmful actions. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which could be a tactic to avoid detection or re-execution. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent.",
