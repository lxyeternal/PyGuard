It then sets the file as executable and appends a command to the user's '.bashrc' file to execute this file in the background on each new shell session. This behavior suggests the code is designed to install and persistently run a potentially malicious payload, such as a backdoor or malware, on the victim's system. The use of a hardcoded IP address, silent download, and modification of startup scripts are common tactics in malicious software to establish persistence and remote control.",
