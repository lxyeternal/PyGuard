      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'EncodedCommand' parameter, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently and without window visibility, further indicating malicious intent. The setup function appears benign and may be used to disguise or distract from the malicious activity, but the core concern is the embedded PowerShell command that is executed covertly.",
