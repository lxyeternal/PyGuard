      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within the custom installation class 'GruppeInstall'. During installation on Windows systems ('nt'), it decrypts and executes code fetched from a Fernet-encrypted string, which is likely to be malicious. This behavior enables remote code execution during package installation, potentially allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code, install malware, or compromise the host system. The use of obfuscation (encrypted payload) and the conditional execution on Windows further suggest malicious intent.",
