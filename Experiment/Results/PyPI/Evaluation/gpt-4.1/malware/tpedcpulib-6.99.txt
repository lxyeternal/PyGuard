      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious payloads or activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution. The use of 'creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW' and 'shell=False' further suggests an attempt to run the command stealthily. Overall, these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, conditional execution based on file presence, and stealthy process creation—are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to download, execute, or hide malicious payloads on the target system.",
