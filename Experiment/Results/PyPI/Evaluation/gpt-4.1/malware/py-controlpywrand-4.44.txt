      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious payload designed to run arbitrary code or download/execute malicious content without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a seemingly legitimate Python package, which could be used to mask malicious activity or establish persistence. The combination of obfuscated command execution and the use of setup functions for potentially malicious purposes indicates malicious intent.",
