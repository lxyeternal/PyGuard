      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by repeatedly downloading a file named 'image.png' from a remote server, decoding its contents as base64, and executing it dynamically. This pattern suggests an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code fetched from an external source, which can lead to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code uses proxies and rate-limiting mechanisms, indicating an intent to obfuscate its activity and avoid detection or blocking, further supporting malicious intent.",
