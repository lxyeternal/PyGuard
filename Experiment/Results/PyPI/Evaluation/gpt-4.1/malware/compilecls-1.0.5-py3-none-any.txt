      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious trojan designed to stealthily extract sensitive user data and perform malicious activities. It includes functionalities to steal browser credentials (passwords, cookies, history, credit card info), extract Discord tokens and user information, gather system details, capture screenshots, and locate specific files containing passwords or sensitive data. It also injects malicious scripts into Discord desktop processes, kills security or debugging processes, and exfiltrates all collected data via Discord webhooks and file uploads to external servers. The code actively avoids execution in virtual machines or on known analysis systems, indicating an intent to evade detection. Overall, it is a comprehensive info-stealer and backdoor trojan aimed at compromising user privacy and security.",
