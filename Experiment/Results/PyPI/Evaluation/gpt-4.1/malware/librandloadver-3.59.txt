This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized connections, or other malicious actions. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially executed without user consent or transparency, indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the embedded PowerShell command is a significant red flag for malicious behavior.",
