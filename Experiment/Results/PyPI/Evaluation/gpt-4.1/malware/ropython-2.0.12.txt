      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a commented-out section that decodes and executes a base64-encoded payload. This payload, when decoded, appears to perform network requests, potentially to exfiltrate data or execute remote commands. The use of 'exec' on decoded data is a classic indicator of malicious activity, as it allows arbitrary code execution. Although this section is commented out, its presence suggests an intent to include malicious behavior, which could be activated if the comments are removed. Additionally, the code imports 'base64' but does not use it elsewhere, indicating possible obfuscation or preparation for malicious payload execution. Overall, the code exhibits malicious intent through the embedded, but currently inactive, payload designed for remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
