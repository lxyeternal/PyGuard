      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute arbitrary Python code in a subprocess, importing a module named 'secrevtwo' without any apparent reason. The use of subprocess.Popen with inline code execution and the attempt to import 'secrevtwo'—which is not a standard library—suggests an attempt to hide or execute malicious code dynamically. Additionally, the code ignores import errors silently, which can be used to evade detection. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to execute hidden or malicious payloads, potentially to compromise the system or exfiltrate data.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs extensive patching of system and third-party libraries (such as socket, requests, gunicorn, pymysql, and gevent) to modify their default behaviors. Notably, it intercepts and alters DNS resolution functions (like getaddrinfo) and socket connection methods to redirect network traffic, potentially to malicious or unintended endpoints. It also injects custom cookies into HTTP requests, manipulates port mappings, and overrides request ID generation with a custom UUID-based encoding, which could be used to track or impersonate requests. Additionally, it patches database connection handling and logging mechanisms, possibly to hide malicious activity or ensure persistence. These modifications collectively suggest an intent to covertly control network communications, evade detection, or manipulate server behavior, which are characteristic of malicious or backdoor code.",
