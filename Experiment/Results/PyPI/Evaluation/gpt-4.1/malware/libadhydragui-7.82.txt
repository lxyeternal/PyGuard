      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and may perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized connections, or executing other malicious scripts. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a hidden window and the obfuscated command strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious behavior. The setup function appears benign but is likely used to mask or distract from the malicious subprocess execution.",
