This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to fetch and execute malicious payloads, malware, or spyware from an attacker-controlled server. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks related to the package and directly calls 'post_install()' outside of a proper setup command, further indicating malicious intent to execute arbitrary commands during or after installation.",
