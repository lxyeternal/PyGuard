      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given its obfuscated nature. Additionally, the code silently ignores errors with broad except clauses, which can hide failures or malicious activity. The presence of such obfuscation and silent error handling strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions without user awareness.",
