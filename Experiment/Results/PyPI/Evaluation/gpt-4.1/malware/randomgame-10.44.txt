The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payload or commands that could perform harmful actions such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing unauthorized connections. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently and without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The presence of such obfuscated commands and silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent, despite the seemingly benign setup() call for a Python package.",
