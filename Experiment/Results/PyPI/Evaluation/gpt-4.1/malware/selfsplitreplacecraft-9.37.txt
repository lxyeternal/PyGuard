      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -EncodedCommand' parameter. The base64-encoded string likely contains malicious payload, such as downloading or executing malicious files, establishing persistence, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of obfuscated commands and silent failure handling strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially used for malware delivery or remote control.",
