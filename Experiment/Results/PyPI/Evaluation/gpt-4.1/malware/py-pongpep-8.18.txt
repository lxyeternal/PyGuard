      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. The presence of such obfuscated command execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially since it is conditionally executed when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, possibly to avoid detection or repeated execution.",
