      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden malicious behavior within the custom installation class 'GruppeInstall'. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet encryption, which is likely to be malicious code. This behavior enables the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. The obfuscation of the payload and the use of encrypted data strongly suggest malicious intent.",
