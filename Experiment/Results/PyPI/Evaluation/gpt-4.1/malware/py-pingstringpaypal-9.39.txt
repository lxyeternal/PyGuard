      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely designed to perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a seemingly obfuscated command indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window), which is typical of malicious scripts aiming to avoid detection. The presence of such obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
