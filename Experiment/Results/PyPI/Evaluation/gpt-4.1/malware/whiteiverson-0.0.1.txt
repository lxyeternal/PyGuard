This behavior is highly suspicious and typical of malware or trojan activity, as it involves fetching potentially malicious payloads from the internet and running them without user consent or awareness. The use of 'os.system' to run the downloaded executable further indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to execute arbitrary code, install backdoors, or compromise the system.",
