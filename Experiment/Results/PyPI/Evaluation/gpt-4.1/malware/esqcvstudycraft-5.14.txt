      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads or activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and conditional execution based on file presence strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or performing other harmful actions without user awareness.",
