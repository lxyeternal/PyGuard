      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or part of the malicious payload. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with hidden process creation indicates malicious intent aimed at executing malicious scripts or commands covertly.",
