      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to obfuscate and run malicious code without immediate detection. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads from external sources, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
