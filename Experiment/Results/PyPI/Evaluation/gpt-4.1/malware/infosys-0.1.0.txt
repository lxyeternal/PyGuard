      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer (trojan) designed to extract sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following harmful activities:\n\n- Collects Discord tokens, user account info, email, phone, badges, billing info, and friends list, then exfiltrates this data to a remote Discord webhook.\n- Extracts stored passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) by copying local database files, decrypting stored credentials using Windows Data Protection API, and then uploading the data.\n- Retrieves tokens from Discord local storage files and attempts to validate and exfiltrate them.\n- Searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files containing keywords related to passwords, accounts, crypto wallets, and other sensitive info, then uploads these files.\n- Zips and uploads various application data, including wallet files, gaming accounts, and other potentially valuable data.\n- Uses threading to perform multiple data collection and zipping operations concurrently.\n- Installs missing Python modules silently, indicating an attempt to ensure execution in restricted environments.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to stealthily harvest user credentials, tokens, cookies, and personal files, then send this information to an attacker-controlled webhook, constituting a serious malicious threat.",
