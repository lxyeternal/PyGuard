      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated nature of the command. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which suggests persistence or anti-analysis techniques. The presence of such obfuscated and conditional remote code execution strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially used for malware delivery, remote control, or data exfiltration.",
