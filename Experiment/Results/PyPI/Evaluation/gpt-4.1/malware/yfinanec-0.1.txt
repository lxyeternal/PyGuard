      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears intentionally designed to conceal its true purpose. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and environment variables in a manner consistent with malware or malicious scripts. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or executing unauthorized operations. The presence of code that interacts with system internals (e.g., win32com, ctypes, os functions) and the convoluted structure indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior from casual inspection. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious.",
