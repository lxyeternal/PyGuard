      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within a custom install class that executes encrypted code during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it decrypts and executes a Fernet-encrypted payload using the 'exec' function, which can run arbitrary malicious code. This behavior is concealed within the setup script, making it likely intended for malicious purposes such as remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of encrypted payloads and execution during installation are common tactics in malware to evade detection and persist on compromised systems.",
