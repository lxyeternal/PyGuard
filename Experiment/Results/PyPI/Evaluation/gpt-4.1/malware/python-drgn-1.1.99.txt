This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate installation or setup tasks that justify such data collection, and the use of a hardcoded webhook URL suggests an intent to secretly transmit sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server.",
