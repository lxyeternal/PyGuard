      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to covertly establish persistence on a Windows system by creating startup folders and cloning malicious repositories into them. It clones potentially harmful repositories containing scripts and executables, then moves and executes a malicious executable (`main.exe`) from the startup folder. This behavior indicates an intent to automatically run malicious code upon system startup, which is characteristic of malware or backdoor activity. The use of cloning from external GitHub repositories and executing files without user consent further confirms malicious intent.",
