      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if this file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or to ensure the payload runs only once. The use of 'powershell' with encoded commands, combined with the obfuscation, strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command indicates malicious behavior.",
