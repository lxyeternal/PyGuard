      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious code. This behavior suggests an attempt to run potentially harmful scripts or payloads silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code performs a check for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and proceeds to execute the PowerShell command only if the file does not exist, indicating a possible persistence or anti-analysis mechanism. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other harmful activities.",
