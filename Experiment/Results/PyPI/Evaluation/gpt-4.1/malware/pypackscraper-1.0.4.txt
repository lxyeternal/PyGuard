      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted payloads designed to execute hidden malicious activities. It employs multiple layers of obfuscation, including base64, zlib compression, and character code manipulations, to conceal its true intent. The presence of eval() with dynamically generated code, along with complex string manipulations, indicates an attempt to run malicious code covertly. The embedded long, seemingly random string likely encodes malicious instructions or payloads that could perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or other harmful operations. Overall, the code is crafted to evade detection and execute malicious behavior on the host system.",
