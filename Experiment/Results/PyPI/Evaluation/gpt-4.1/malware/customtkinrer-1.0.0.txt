      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that executes decrypted malicious code during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it decrypts a payload using Fernet encryption and executes it via `exec()`, which can run arbitrary malicious commands or payloads. This behavior is concealed within an overridden `install` class, making it difficult to detect through standard static analysis. The use of obfuscated variable and class names further indicates malicious intent, aiming to hide malicious activity from casual inspection.",
