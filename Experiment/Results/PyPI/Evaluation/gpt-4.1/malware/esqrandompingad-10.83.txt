      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell command execution via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The presence of the encoded command, combined with the lack of clear legitimate purpose, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Additionally, the code silently attempts to run this command without user awareness, further suggesting malicious intent.",
