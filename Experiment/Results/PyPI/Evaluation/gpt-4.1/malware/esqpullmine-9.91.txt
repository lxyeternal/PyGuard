      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This command could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malware, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent, especially given the context of the code attempting to run hidden PowerShell commands without clear legitimate purpose.",
