      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment referencing a suspicious URL ('www.esquelesquad.rip') and the obfuscated PowerShell invocation. Additionally, the code creates a Python package setup, which appears benign but is likely used as a cover or to facilitate further malicious activities. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious payloads.",
