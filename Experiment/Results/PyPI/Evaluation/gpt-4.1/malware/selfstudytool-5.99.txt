      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, install, or execute harmful payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, indicating an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious activity aimed at covertly compromising the system.",
