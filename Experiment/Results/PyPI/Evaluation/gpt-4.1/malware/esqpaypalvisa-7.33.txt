      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, execute, or perform other harmful actions without user awareness. Additionally, the code's presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution indicates malicious intent, such as malware delivery or persistence mechanisms.",
