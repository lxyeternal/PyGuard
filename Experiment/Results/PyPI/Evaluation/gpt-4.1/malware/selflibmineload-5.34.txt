      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears legitimate but may be used as a cover for malicious activities, especially since the initial subprocess call is suspicious. Overall, the presence of the encoded PowerShell command and its execution indicates malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious payloads surreptitiously.",
