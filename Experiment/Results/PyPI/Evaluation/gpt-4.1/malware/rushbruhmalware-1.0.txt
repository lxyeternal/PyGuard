      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated payload that, when executed, likely decompresses and decodes hidden malicious code. The use of base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic execution via exec() suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additionally, the presence of a setup() call with a description explicitly stating 'this is a malware, please dont install this' indicates malicious intent. The overall behavior is to hide malicious code within seemingly benign setup scripts, potentially to infect systems or perform harmful actions when executed.",
