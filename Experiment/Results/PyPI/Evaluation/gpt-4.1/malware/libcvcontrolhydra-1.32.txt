      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or compromising the system. Additionally, the code's obfuscation and the presence of a suspicious URL comment ('//dl.droppbx.com/szgn9zbub0qmv/Esqeule.exe') suggest malicious intent. The setup function appears benign but is likely used as a decoy or to mask malicious activity. Overall, the code exhibits behavior characteristic of malware, including stealthy command execution and obfuscation.",
