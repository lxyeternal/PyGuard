      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to conceal malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with conditional checks indicates malicious intent, potentially used for malware delivery, remote control, or other harmful activities.",
