      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class `GruppeInstall` that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic used in malware or backdoor distribution. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows further suggests malicious intent to evade detection and target specific environments. Overall, this code exhibits malicious behavior by executing hidden, encrypted code during installation, which can compromise system security.",
