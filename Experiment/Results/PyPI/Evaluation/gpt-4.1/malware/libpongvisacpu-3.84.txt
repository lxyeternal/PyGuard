      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zbu0qmv/ESQuele.exe'), potentially installing malware or performing other harmful actions. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions suggests an attempt to conceal or suppress errors, which is typical in malicious scripts to avoid detection. The presence of a seemingly legitimate setup() call appears to be a decoy or a way to blend malicious activity with legitimate package setup routines. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious intent, including obfuscated command execution and external payload retrieval.",
