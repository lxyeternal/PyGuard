      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code using Fernet encryption. This behavior indicates an attempt to run hidden, potentially harmful code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The use of obfuscated strings, conditional execution based on OS, and dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at compromising the target system.",
