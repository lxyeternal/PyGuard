      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or payloads silently on the target system. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious activity. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command, especially with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, indicates malicious intent to execute potentially harmful commands covertly, which is characteristic of malware or backdoor activity.",
