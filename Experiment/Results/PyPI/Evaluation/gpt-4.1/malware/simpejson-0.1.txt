      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor behavior. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, environment variable access, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to escalate privileges by checking for admin rights and executing potentially harmful system operations, such as creating shortcuts and manipulating files in system directories. Overall, this code is malicious, likely intended to compromise the host system, exfiltrate data, or establish persistent access.",
