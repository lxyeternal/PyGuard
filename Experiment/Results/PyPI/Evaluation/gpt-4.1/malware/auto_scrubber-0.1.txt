      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a payload from a URL determined dynamically based on the system architecture. It constructs the URL using obfuscated, hashed data, retrieves binary content, XOR-decrypts it, saves it as an executable file in a hidden directory (~/.local/bin/AutoScrub), sets executable permissions, and then runs it silently. This pattern indicates an attempt to stealthily execute potentially harmful code, such as malware or backdoors, on the host system. The obfuscation, dynamic URL generation, and silent execution are common tactics used in malicious scripts to evade detection and maintain persistence.",
