      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing additional payloads, establishing persistence, or compromising the system. The use of hidden window execution and obfuscated commands are common tactics in malware to evade detection and maintain stealth. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run malicious code in the background, indicating malicious intent.",
