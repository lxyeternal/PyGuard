      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `custom_command()` that executes a shell command to retrieve an access token from Google Cloud metadata service and then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to an external server (`https://9435-34-42-190-190.ngrok-free.app/hellofrompip`). This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive credentials (Google Cloud access tokens) to an attacker-controlled server, which is malicious. The code hooks this function into the installation, development, and egg info commands, ensuring the exfiltration occurs during package setup or development, making it stealthy and persistent.",
