      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer (commonly called a 'stealer') designed to extract sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following harmful activities:\n\n- Collects and exfiltrates Discord tokens, user account information, billing details, and friend lists by accessing Discord API endpoints.\n- Extracts stored passwords, cookies, and tokens from browsers like Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers, including specific extensions like MetaMask.\n- Retrieves saved credentials and cookies from messaging apps like Telegram.\n- Gathers data from gaming platforms such as Steam, Riot Games, and others.\n- Compresses and uploads the stolen data (passwords, cookies, files) to file hosting services like GoFile or AnonFiles, and then sends the download links to a Discord webhook.\n- Implements functions to decrypt encrypted data, indicating it targets Windows systems with specific API calls.\n- Uses threading to perform multiple data collection tasks concurrently.\n\nOverall, the code's purpose is to surreptitiously harvest user credentials, tokens, cookies, and personal files, then exfiltrate this information to an attacker-controlled server, which is characteristic of malicious malware used for identity theft, account hijacking, and further malicious activities.",
