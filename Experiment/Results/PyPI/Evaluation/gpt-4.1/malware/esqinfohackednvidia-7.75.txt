      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing malicious content without user consent. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' indicates an attempt to evade detection and run covertly. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing this command, which may be a simple anti-analysis or persistence mechanism. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution, malware download, or system compromise.",
