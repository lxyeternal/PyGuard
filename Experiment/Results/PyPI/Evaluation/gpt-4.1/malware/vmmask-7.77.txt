      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as executing obfuscated or malicious scripts. The encoded command is likely designed to download or run malicious payloads silently in the background (hidden window), bypassing user awareness. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide failures or detection attempts. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with silent error handling strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
