      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or commands that could perform harmful actions such as downloading, executing, or manipulating system files without user consent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks indicates malicious intent, potentially used for remote code execution, persistence, or other malicious activities.",
