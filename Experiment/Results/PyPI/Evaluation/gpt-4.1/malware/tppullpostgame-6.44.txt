      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise or hide malicious activity, especially given the use of encoded commands and the silent execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote control, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions.",
