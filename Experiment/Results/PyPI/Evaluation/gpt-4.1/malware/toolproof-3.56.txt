      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window (creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW), indicating an intent to run covertly. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious software without user awareness. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions may be to suppress errors and maintain stealth. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to perform covert operations on the host system.",
