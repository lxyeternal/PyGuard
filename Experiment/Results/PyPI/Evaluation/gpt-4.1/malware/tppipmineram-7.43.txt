      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially for purposes such as remote control, data exfiltration, or malware installation. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover or decoy. Overall, the presence of obfuscated command execution indicates malicious intent.",
