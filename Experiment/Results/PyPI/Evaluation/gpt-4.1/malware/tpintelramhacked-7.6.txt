      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is likely designed to download and execute malicious content from a remote server (as indicated by the URL in the encoded command). Additionally, the code creates a setup script that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or a means to disguise malicious activity. The use of hidden PowerShell execution, obfuscated commands, and the presence of suspicious URLs strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation.",
