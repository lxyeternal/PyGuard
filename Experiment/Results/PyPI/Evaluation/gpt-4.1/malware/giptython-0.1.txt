      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor behavior. The use of dynamic string assembly, convoluted logic, and environment variable access suggests an attempt to evade detection and execute malicious payloads. Specifically, it can create shortcuts, access environment variables, and manipulate files, which are common tactics in malware to establish persistence, exfiltrate data, or execute arbitrary code. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious scripts intended to compromise system security and perform unauthorized actions.",
