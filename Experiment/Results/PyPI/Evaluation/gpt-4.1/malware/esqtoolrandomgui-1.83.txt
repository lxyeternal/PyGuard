      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command decodes to a script that likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing additional payloads from external sources (e.g., 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zubu0qmv/ESQEule.exe'). This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run malicious software, which is characteristic of malware. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
