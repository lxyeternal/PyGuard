      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package distribution. The combination of obfuscated command execution and package setup suggests malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, malware, or exfiltrating data without user consent.",
