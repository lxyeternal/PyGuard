      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is a highly malicious credential and data stealer designed to extract sensitive information from the victim's system. It performs several malicious actions, including: \n- Harvesting Discord tokens, cookies, and passwords by accessing local storage, encrypted databases, and browser data.\n- Extracting Roblox cookies via registry queries.\n- Decrypting stored passwords and cookies using master keys and AES decryption.\n- Collecting system information such as IP address, geolocation, hardware specs, and Windows product keys.\n- Injecting malicious JavaScript into Discord desktop applications to potentially execute further malicious code.\n- Killing Discord processes to interfere with user activity.\n- Hiding itself and setting up persistence by copying to startup folders.\n- Archiving all stolen data into a ZIP file.\n- Exfiltrating all gathered data, including tokens, passwords, cookies, system info, and files, to a remote Discord webhook.\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily steal user credentials, tokens, cookies, and system information for malicious purposes, such as account hijacking, identity theft, or further exploitation.",
