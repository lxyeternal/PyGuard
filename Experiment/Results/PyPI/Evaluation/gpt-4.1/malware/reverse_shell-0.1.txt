      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell client that connects to a local server on port 4444. It continuously listens for commands from the server, executes them on the host machine, and sends back the command output. This behavior allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised system, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially perform malicious activities such as data theft, system manipulation, or further malware deployment. The presence of a command to terminate the connection indicates control over the session, reinforcing its malicious intent.",
