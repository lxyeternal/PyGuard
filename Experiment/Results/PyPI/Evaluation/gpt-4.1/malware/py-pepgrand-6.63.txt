      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing malicious content without user awareness. The presence of such obfuscated command execution, especially combined with the check for a specific directory ('tahg') and the attempt to run hidden PowerShell commands, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise malicious activity under the guise of a legitimate setup script, which is a common tactic in malware or backdoor scripts.",
