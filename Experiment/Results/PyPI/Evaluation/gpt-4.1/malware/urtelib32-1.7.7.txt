      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious intent. It attempts to elevate privileges by relaunching itself with administrator rights, which is often used to bypass security restrictions. It then downloads a file from a remote server, saves it as 'image.png', and executes its contents directly in memory using `exec(b64decode(...))`. This behavior suggests the code is designed to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code fetched from an external source, which could lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or other malicious activities. The use of obfuscation techniques like decoding and executing external code further supports its malicious nature.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches a script from a remote server and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows the remote server to run arbitrary code on the client machine, which can lead to various malicious activities such as data theft, system compromise, or installing malware. The URL and headers do not provide any legitimate context, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute potentially harmful code received from an external source, making it malicious.",
