      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes and executes a base64-encoded marshaled payload, which likely contains malicious instructions. The embedded payload appears to include a URL to a remote server (https://pixelbrain.com/api/file/Km41s68f?download), which suggests it may be designed to download and execute additional malicious content or exfiltrate data. The use of obfuscation techniques such as marshaling and base64 encoding indicates an intent to hide malicious behavior, making it highly suspicious and indicative of malware or a backdoor.",
