      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is executed with a hidden window. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions without user awareness. The use of encoded commands and hidden execution strongly suggests an intent to evade detection and perform malicious operations. Additionally, the code's attempt to run this command without proper validation or user consent indicates malicious intent.",
