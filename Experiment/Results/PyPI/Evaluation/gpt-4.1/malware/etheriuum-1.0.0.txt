      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a remote payload fetched via Fernet encryption. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code from an external source, which is a common tactic in malicious software to execute malicious payloads or establish backdoors. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows further suggests malicious intent, as legitimate setup scripts typically do not perform such actions.",
