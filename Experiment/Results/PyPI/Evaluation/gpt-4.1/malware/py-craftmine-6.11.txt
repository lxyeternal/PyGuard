      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with hidden window flags, indicating an intent to run malicious or unauthorized code silently. Additionally, the code performs a check for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if the file does not exist, which could be a tactic to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks suggests malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities.",
