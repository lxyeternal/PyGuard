      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or activity, such as downloading or executing malicious code, which is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may be used to mask malicious intent or to establish persistence. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the context suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or executing unauthorized actions.",
