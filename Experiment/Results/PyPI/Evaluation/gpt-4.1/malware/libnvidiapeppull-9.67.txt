      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities.",
