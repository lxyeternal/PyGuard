This behavior can be used to harvest sensitive information such as environment variables, including potentially sensitive data like API keys, credentials, or other environment-specific secrets, without user consent. Such activity is characteristic of malicious or at least suspicious behavior, as it involves data exfiltration and remote communication without clear legitimate purpose.",
