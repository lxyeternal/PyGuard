      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a larger malicious package. The use of hidden process creation, obfuscated commands, and the lack of clear benign purpose strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to download, execute, or persist malicious payloads on the target system.",
