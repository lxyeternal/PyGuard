      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to steal Roblox account cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from the user's browser cookies across multiple browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, Chromium). It then validates the stolen cookie by checking its validity via Roblox's API. If valid, it retrieves sensitive user information such as UserID, username, Robux balance, account age, and other personal details. All this information, including the cookie itself, is then sent to a specified Discord webhook. This behavior constitutes credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, which is malicious and intended for malicious purposes such as account hijacking or abuse.",
