      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, and the use of 'subprocess.Popen' with 'creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the exact payload is encoded, such obfuscation combined with silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious code or payloads on the host system. Additionally, the code's attempt to run this command without any validation or user consent is suspicious and characteristic of malicious scripts.",
