      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'EncodedCommand' parameter. The base64-encoded string decodes to a PowerShell script that likely performs malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The use of hidden window style and suppression of errors further indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a larger malicious package. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and hidden subprocess calls strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system.",
