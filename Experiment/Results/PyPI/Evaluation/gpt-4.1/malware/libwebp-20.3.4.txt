      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker (hosted at an ngrok URL). This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is malicious. The code appears to be designed to surreptitiously gather and transmit user environment details, potentially for malicious purposes such as reconnaissance or targeted attacks.",
