      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload delivery. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command, especially with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, suggests an attempt to run potentially harmful code covertly. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only then executes the PowerShell command, indicating a possible trigger mechanism. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the critical malicious behavior is the hidden PowerShell execution, which is a common tactic used in malware to evade detection and execute malicious payloads.",
