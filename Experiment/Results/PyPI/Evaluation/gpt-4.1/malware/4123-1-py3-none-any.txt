Additionally, it terminates the Fiddler process if running. These behaviors are characteristic of credential-stealing malware or information hijacking scripts, as they covertly harvest user tokens and system data without user consent, potentially for malicious purposes such as account hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized access.",
