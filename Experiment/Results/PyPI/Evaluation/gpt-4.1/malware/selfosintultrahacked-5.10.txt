      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently. The URL embedded within the command ('cdn.discordapp.com/attacks/10316...') suggests that it may be downloading or executing malicious content from an external source. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run potentially harmful code without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The subsequent setup function appears benign but is likely a decoy or part of the obfuscation, as it does not prevent the malicious payload from executing. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and external URL references strongly indicates malicious intent.",
