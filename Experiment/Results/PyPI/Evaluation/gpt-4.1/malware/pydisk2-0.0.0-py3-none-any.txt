      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer (spyware) designed to extract sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It collects tokens, passwords, cookies, billing information, and files from browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord, Steam, Riot, and Telegram. It then exfiltrates this data by uploading it to external servers (e.g., anonfiles, gofile.io) and sends detailed reports via Discord webhooks. Additionally, it searches user directories for files containing keywords related to passwords, accounts, and cryptocurrencies, compresses them, and uploads the archives. The code also attempts to kill processes associated with cryptocurrency wallets and other applications to prevent interference. Overall, it functions as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting a wide range of user credentials and sensitive data, which is inherently malicious.",
