      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within the custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted string, which is likely to be malicious. This behavior enables remote code execution or payload delivery without explicit user consent, constituting a backdoor or malware behavior. The obfuscation of strings and the use of cryptographic decryption further suggest malicious intent to hide the payload's true purpose.",
