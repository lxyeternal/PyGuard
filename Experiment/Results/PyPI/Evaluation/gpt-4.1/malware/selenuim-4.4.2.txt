      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs malicious activities by retrieving and executing a potentially harmful executable from an external URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') during installation. It also sends the system's 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to a suspicious domain ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation <COMPUTERNAME>'). This behavior indicates an attempt to infect the host system with malware, exfiltrate system information, and potentially compromise security. The use of obfuscated or indirect download and execution methods is characteristic of malicious code.",
