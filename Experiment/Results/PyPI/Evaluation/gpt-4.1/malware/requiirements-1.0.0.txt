      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet encryption. The payload is embedded as an encrypted string within the code, and the decryption key is hardcoded. This behavior indicates an attempt to run malicious code silently during package installation, which can be used to execute arbitrary malicious actions such as downloading malware, establishing backdoors, or compromising the system. The use of encryption and obfuscation techniques further suggests malicious intent to evade detection.",
