      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class (PyInstall) that, during the installation process on macOS systems, decodes and executes base64-encoded commands to establish an HTTPS connection to a remote server (hosted at 'europel-west2-workload-4229155.cloudfunctions.net') and sends the contents of specific files ('application_default_credentials.json' and 'credentials.db') via POST requests with a custom header ('X-Trace-Correlation-ID') derived from a SHA-256 hash of a string obtained from the code. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or remote command execution, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code also obfuscates its network activity and file paths, further suggesting malicious intent.",
