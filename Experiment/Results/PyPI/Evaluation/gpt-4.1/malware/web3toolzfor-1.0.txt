It collects these files, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and then uploads the archive to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it aims to secretly gather and transmit potentially private or sensitive information without user consent, which can be used for malicious purposes such as account hijacking, credential theft, or further exploitation.",

This behavior suggests data exfiltration, potentially of sensitive user information or application data, without user consent. The base64-decoded URL indicates communication with a remote server, further supporting malicious intent. Overall, the script is designed to stealthily gather and transmit user data, which is characteristic of malicious malware.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes, primarily to steal sensitive user data such as cryptocurrency wallet tokens, passwords, cookies, and other private information. It imports modules with names suggesting they target popular cryptocurrency wallets (metamask, exodus), messaging platforms (telegram, discord), and browser data (passwords, cookies). The functions called (e.g., find_tokens, runner, machineinfo, screenshot, telegram) are likely to perform activities such as extracting tokens, capturing screenshots, gathering system information, and potentially exfiltrating this data. The use of multiple try-except blocks with silent exception handling indicates an attempt to avoid crashing and to operate stealthily. Running the main function in a separate thread further suggests an intent to run covertly or persistently. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malware or spyware designed to steal user credentials and private data without consent.",

It searches for patterns that match Discord token formats, collects these tokens, and then exfiltrates them by sending the data to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it involves unauthorized access to sensitive user credentials and their transmission to an attacker-controlled server, potentially leading to account hijacking, identity theft, or further malicious activities.",

It copies the extension data directories, compresses them into ZIP archives, and then uploads these archives to a remote server via an encoded URL. This behavior indicates an attempt to steal user wallet information or other sensitive data stored within browser extensions, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at data theft and privacy invasion.",

The code also contains a base64-encoded URL pointing to a suspicious domain, which further indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the function call to send the data is commented out, suggesting it may be intended to be activated later or hidden from casual inspection, a common tactic in malicious scripts.",
