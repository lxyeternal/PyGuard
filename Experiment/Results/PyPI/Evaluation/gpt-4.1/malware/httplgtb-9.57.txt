      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The use of a hidden window and encoded command suggests an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing this command, possibly to avoid repeated execution or to target specific environments. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to run covertly and perform unauthorized actions.",
