      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process, executes decrypted code fetched from a Fernet-encrypted payload embedded within the script. Specifically, if the operating system is Windows ('nt'), it decrypts a payload and executes it via `exec()`. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code during package installation, which can be used to compromise the target system, install backdoors, or perform other malicious activities. The obfuscation of class and variable names further suggests malicious intent, aiming to hide the true purpose of the code.",
