      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'EncodedCommand' parameter. The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payloads such as malware, backdoors, or remote access tools. Additionally, the code attempts to perform a seemingly benign package setup, which may serve as a decoy or be exploited to execute malicious code during installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution or system compromise.",
