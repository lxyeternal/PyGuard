      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely fetches or runs malicious code from an external source. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise or legitimize malicious intent. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and the attempt to hide its activity indicates malicious behavior.",
