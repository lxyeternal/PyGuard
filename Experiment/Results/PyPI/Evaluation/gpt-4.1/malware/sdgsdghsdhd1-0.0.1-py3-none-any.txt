      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious information stealer (trojan) designed to extract sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- **Credential Harvesting:** Extracts saved passwords, cookies, and tokens from browsers like Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and Discord, including decrypting encrypted data.\n- **Token Theft:** Finds and exfiltrates Discord tokens and other authentication tokens, enabling account hijacking.\n- **Account Information Gathering:** Retrieves user profile details, email, phone number, Nitro status, badges, billing info, and friends list from Discord.\n- **File Collection:** Searches user directories for files containing sensitive keywords (e.g., passwords, accounts, crypto wallets) and archives them.\n- **Zip and Upload Data:** Compresses collected data and uploads it to file hosting services (e.g., anonfiles, gofile.io) for remote access.\n- **Telegram Notification:** Sends collected data and status updates via Telegram bot API.\n- **Persistence and Evasion:** Attempts to hide its activity by killing processes, creating zip archives, and scanning common directories.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily steal user credentials, tokens, personal files, and sensitive information, then exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers, making it a clear malicious payload.",
