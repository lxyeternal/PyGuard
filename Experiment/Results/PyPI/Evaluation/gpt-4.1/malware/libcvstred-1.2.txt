      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, which may serve as a decoy or to blend malicious activity within legitimate package installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and conditional triggers indicates malicious intent aimed at stealthy remote code execution or payload delivery.",
