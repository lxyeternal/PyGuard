      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple functions that can cause significant harm or disruption to a user's system. Specifically:\n\n- `ShutdownOnStart()`: Prompts the user for confirmation and, if accepted, creates a script (`DANGER.py`) that immediately shuts down the system (`shutdown /s /t 0`). It then attempts to compile this script into an executable (`DANGER.exe`) using PyInstaller, and moves it to the startup folder, which would cause the system to shut down automatically upon next startup. This is a clear malicious behavior intended to disable the system.\n\n- `Spam_Windows()` and `Spam_Linux()`: These functions spawn a large number of terminal or command prompt windows, potentially causing system slowdown or crash.\n\n- `Create_Files()`: Creates a large number of files with specified extensions, which could be used for disk filling or other malicious purposes.\n\n- `Delete_Files()`: Attempts to delete all files in the current directory using `shutil.rmtree`, which is inappropriate and could cause data loss.\n\n- `Crash_by_Numbers()`: Performs intensive computations and prints large arrays, potentially causing high CPU usage or memory exhaustion.\n\n- `Open_BrowserWins()`: Opens a large number of browser windows, which can overwhelm system resources.\n\nOverall, the code includes destructive, disruptive, and potentially damaging actions, especially the `ShutdownOnStart()` function designed to disable the system. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious or harmful scripts.",
