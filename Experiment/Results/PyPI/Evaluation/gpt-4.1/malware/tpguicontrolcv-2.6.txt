      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The command is encoded in Base64, making it difficult to analyze directly, but its presence indicates an attempt to run potentially harmful code silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a method to avoid repeated execution or detection. The overall behavior suggests an attempt to perform malicious actions covertly, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, making this code malicious.",
