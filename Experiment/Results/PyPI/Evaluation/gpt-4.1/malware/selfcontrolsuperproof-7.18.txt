      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which can be a tactic to avoid detection or repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a base64-encoded string suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activity, such as downloading, executing, or establishing remote control. Overall, these behaviors indicate malicious intent, including stealthy execution and potential remote code execution.",
