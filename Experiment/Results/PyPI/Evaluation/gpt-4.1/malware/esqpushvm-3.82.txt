      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/szgn9t9zbu' embedded in the base64 string). Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, potentially to avoid repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional triggers strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing harmful payloads on the victim's system.",
