      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process, executes a decrypted payload fetched from a Fernet-encrypted string. This payload is only executed on Windows systems ('nt'), and it is embedded as an encrypted string within the code. The use of encryption, conditional execution based on OS, and execution of dynamically decrypted code strongly suggest malicious intent, such as downloading and executing malicious payloads, remote code execution, or establishing backdoors. The obfuscation and encryption are typical techniques used to hide malicious behavior from static analysis. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to perform harmful actions during installation.",
