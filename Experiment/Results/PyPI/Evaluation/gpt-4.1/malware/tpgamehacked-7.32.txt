      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious payloads or activities. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads from external sources. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly legitimate Python package setup, which may serve as a decoy or to mask the malicious activity. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the hidden process indicates malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing unauthorized code.",
