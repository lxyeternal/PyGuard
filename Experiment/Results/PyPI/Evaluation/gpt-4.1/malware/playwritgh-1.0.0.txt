This decrypted code is executed via `exec()`, which can run arbitrary malicious payloads, such as installing malware, stealing data, or establishing remote access. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution indicates an intent to conceal malicious activity, making this code highly suspicious and malicious.",
