      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload that decrypts and executes external code at runtime. It uses multiple layers of encoding, compression, and encryption (base64, base32, zlib, marshal, Fernet) to hide its true purpose. The critical part is the final 'exec' statement, which dynamically decrypts and executes code from an encoded string, potentially allowing remote command execution, malware download, or other malicious activities. The presence of such complex, hidden decryption routines strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to conceal its payload and evade detection.",
