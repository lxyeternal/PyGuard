      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears legitimate on the surface but may serve as a cover for malicious activity, especially given the obfuscated PowerShell execution. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and its silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data without user awareness.",
