      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
