      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload embedded within the script. Specifically, it uses the Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt a payload and executes it via `exec()`. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The obfuscated class and variable names, along with the encrypted payload, further suggest malicious intent to hide the true purpose of the code. Overall, this code is designed to surreptitiously execute malicious code during installation, making it malicious.",
