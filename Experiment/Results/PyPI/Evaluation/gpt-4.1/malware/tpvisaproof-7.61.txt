      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or activity, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads from external sources. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if the file does not exist, which can be a tactic to avoid detection or repeated execution. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and conditional execution based on file existence strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration.",
