      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, it checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a mechanism to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to download, install, or execute malicious payloads silently. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the obfuscated PowerShell invocation is a significant red flag for malicious activity.",
