      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command string. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, suggesting an effort to evade detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated code and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially used for malware delivery, remote control, or other harmful activities.",
