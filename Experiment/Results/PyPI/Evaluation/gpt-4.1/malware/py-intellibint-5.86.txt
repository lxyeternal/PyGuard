      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen, which is designed to run hidden and encoded. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads from external sources (e.g., www.esquelesquad.rip or the specified URL). Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package, but the primary malicious activity is embedded in the PowerShell invocation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery, remote code execution, or persistence mechanisms. The use of obfuscation, hidden window, and external URL indicates malicious intent to evade detection and compromise the system.",
