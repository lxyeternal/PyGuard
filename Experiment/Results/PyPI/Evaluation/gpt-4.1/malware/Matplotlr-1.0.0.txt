      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes hidden code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware distribution. The obfuscated class name, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows further suggest malicious intent, as it aims to hide its true purpose and target specific environments for malicious activity.",
