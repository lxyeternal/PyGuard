      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to elevate privileges by checking for administrator rights and relaunching itself with elevated permissions if not already admin. It then downloads a file from a remote server, saves it as 'image.png', and executes its contents as code after decoding from base64. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it involves remote code execution, privilege escalation, and arbitrary code execution, which are common tactics used in malware to compromise the system, execute malicious payloads, and potentially control or damage the host machine.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches a script from a remote server and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows the remote server to run arbitrary code on the client machine, which can lead to various malicious activities such as data theft, system compromise, or installing malware. The use of a non-standard URL and custom headers further suggests an attempt to obfuscate or hide the true intent. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious or potentially harmful code designed to execute remote payloads.",
