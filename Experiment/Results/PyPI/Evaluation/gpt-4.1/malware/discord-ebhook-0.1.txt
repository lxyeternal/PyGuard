      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear intentionally designed to conceal malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and environment variables in a manner consistent with malware or malicious scripts. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at hiding its true purpose. Additionally, the presence of code that interacts with system internals (e.g., win32com, ctypes, os functions) and creates shortcuts or manipulates files indicates potential malicious activity such as persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The final setup call with a suspicious package name ('discord-ebhook') further hints at malicious intent, possibly to set up backdoors or exfiltration channels.",
