During installation, it attempts to retrieve the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and send it to an external server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation <COMPUTERNAME>'). Additionally, it downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable ('python-install.scr') from an external URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') on Windows systems. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system information and execute arbitrary code, which are typical malicious activities.",
