      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious payloads or activities such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing backdoors. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of obfuscated commands and conditional execution based on file existence strongly suggests malicious intent, such as deploying malware or establishing unauthorized access.",
