      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. The use of hidden subprocess execution with encoded commands is a common tactic in malware to evade detection and execute malicious code silently.",
