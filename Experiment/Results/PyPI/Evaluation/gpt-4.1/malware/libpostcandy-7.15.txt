      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. Overall, these behaviors suggest the code is intended to perform malicious activities such as remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration, making it malicious.",
