      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing harmful payloads. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to hide its activity (using hidden window flags and exception handling to suppress errors), which is characteristic of malicious scripts aiming to evade detection. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
