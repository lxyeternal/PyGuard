      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads from external sources. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears legitimate on the surface but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package distribution. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent subprocess invocation strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms.",
