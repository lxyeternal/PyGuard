      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a comprehensive information stealer designed to extract sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- **Token Theft:** Scans local files and browser storage for Discord tokens, MFA tokens, and other authentication tokens, then verifies and exfiltrates them.\n- **Credential Harvesting:** Extracts saved passwords and cookies from Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers by copying their local databases, decrypting stored passwords and cookies, and uploading them.\n- **Account and Wallet Data Collection:** Searches user directories for files related to cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Exodus, Coinbase), gaming accounts (Steam, Riot, etc.), and other sensitive files, zipping and uploading them.\n- **Password and Cookie Collection:** Gathers stored passwords and cookies from browsers, which can be used for account hijacking.\n- **Data Exfiltration via Webhook:** Sends all collected data to a specified Discord webhook, including tokens, credentials, cookies, and files.\n- **Zip and Upload Files:** Compresses found files and uploads them to file hosting services, then shares download links.\n- **Stealth and Persistence:** Uses threading for concurrent operations, attempts to hide processes, and kills certain processes (e.g., browser or wallet processes) to access files.\n\nOverall, the code is a malicious information stealer aimed at compromising user accounts, stealing credentials, and exfiltrating sensitive data for malicious purposes.",
