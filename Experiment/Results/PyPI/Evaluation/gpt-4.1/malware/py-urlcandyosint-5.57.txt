      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.drobx.com/szgn9zbub0qmv/ESQEule.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only then executes the PowerShell command, which could be a way to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
