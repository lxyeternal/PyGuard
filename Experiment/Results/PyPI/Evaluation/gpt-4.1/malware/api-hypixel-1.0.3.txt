      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive configuration files from the user's system, specifically targeting game and account configuration files related to Minecraft and Lunar Client. It retrieves a URL from a remote server (decoded from base64), then collects specific local files if they exist, and sends their contents to the remote server via an HTTP POST request to a webhook URL. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it involves unauthorized data collection and transmission of potentially sensitive user data without consent.",
