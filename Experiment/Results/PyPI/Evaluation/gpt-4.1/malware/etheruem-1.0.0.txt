      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process, executes decrypted and obfuscated code via the Fernet encryption scheme. Specifically, it decrypts a payload and executes it with `exec()`, which can run arbitrary malicious code. This behavior is hidden within a custom `install` class that overrides the `run()` method, making it likely intended to surreptitiously execute malicious payloads during package installation. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution of arbitrary code are classic indicators of malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, malware, or exfiltration mechanisms.",
