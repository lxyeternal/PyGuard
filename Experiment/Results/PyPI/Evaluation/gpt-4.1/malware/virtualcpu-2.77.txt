      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is often used to run malicious scripts covertly. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run potentially harmful code in the background, indicating malicious intent. The setup function, on its own, is benign, but combined with the obfuscated PowerShell execution, the overall behavior is malicious.",
