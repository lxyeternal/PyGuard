      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently, bypassing user detection. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration for a Python package, which appears legitimate but may be used as a cover for malicious activities such as deploying or installing malicious modules. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the silent download/execution behavior indicates malicious intent, potentially aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence.",
