During installation, it attempts to retrieve and execute a potentially harmful executable from an external URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') without user consent. Additionally, it sends system-specific information (the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable) to an external server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ...'), which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run malicious software, making the code malicious.",
