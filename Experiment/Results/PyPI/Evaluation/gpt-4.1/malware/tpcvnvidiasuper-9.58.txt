      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This encoded command likely contains malicious payload or behavior, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique in malware to obfuscate malicious intent. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious behavior.",
