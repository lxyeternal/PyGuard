      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious payload designed to run arbitrary code or download/execute malicious content without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious intent or facilitate further malicious activities such as installing backdoors or malware. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and hidden process execution strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing malicious payloads.",
