      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet encryption. This payload is embedded directly within the code, and its execution can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing remote code execution, data theft, or other malicious activities. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows suggests an attempt to hide malicious behavior and target specific environments, which is characteristic of malicious or backdoor code.",
