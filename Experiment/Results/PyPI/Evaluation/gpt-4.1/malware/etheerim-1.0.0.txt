      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the target machine silently, which can be used for malicious activities such as remote access, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated class names indicates an intent to conceal malicious intent, making this code malicious.",
