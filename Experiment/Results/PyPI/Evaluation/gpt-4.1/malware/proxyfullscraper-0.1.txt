      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to covertly access and exfiltrate files from the user's device, specifically targeting source code files (.py, .php, .zip) and images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) from specified directories. It then uploads these files to a Telegram bot controlled by an attacker, effectively acting as a data stealer or remote access tool. The script operates silently in the background, potentially without user consent, and can harvest sensitive files from the device's storage, including the DCIM folder (commonly containing personal photos). This behavior constitutes malicious activity aimed at unauthorized data collection and exfiltration.",
