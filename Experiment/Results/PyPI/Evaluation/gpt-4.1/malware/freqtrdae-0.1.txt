      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious behavior. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and environment variables in a convoluted manner. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system modifications strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, creating persistence mechanisms, or executing harmful payloads under the guise of legitimate package setup. The presence of code that interacts with system internals (like win32com and ctypes) and file operations further indicates malicious activity aimed at compromising the host system.",
