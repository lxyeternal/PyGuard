      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. During installation (via the custom 'install' command), it checks if the operating system is Windows ('nt'). If so, it imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from the 'cryptography' library, then decrypts an embedded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed directly with 'exec'. This behavior indicates the code is designed to silently download and execute arbitrary code from an external source or embed malicious payloads, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation of variable names and the embedded encrypted data strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to hide malicious activities during installation.",
