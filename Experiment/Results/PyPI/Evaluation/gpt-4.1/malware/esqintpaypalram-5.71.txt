      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window flags, indicating an intent to run covertly. Although the specific payload is obfuscated, such behavior strongly suggests malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malicious code, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's attempt to run this command without any clear legitimate purpose, combined with the obfuscation, indicates malicious intent. The subsequent setup call appears benign but is likely a decoy or part of the malicious payload's concealment. Overall, the code exhibits typical traits of malware or malicious scripts designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions silently.",
