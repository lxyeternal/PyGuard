      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a covert data exfiltration mechanism using DNS queries. It constructs a payload containing system information such as hostname, current working directory, WAN IP address, and local IP addresses. This payload is then hashed and encoded into a hexadecimal string, which is segmented and sent as DNS A record queries to a controlled domain (fake_domain). This technique allows an attacker to stealthily transmit sensitive system information to an external server via DNS traffic, which is often overlooked by traditional security measures. Additionally, the code includes a misleading message about reinstalling pip, possibly to distract or confuse analysts. Overall, this behavior is characteristic of malicious data exfiltration malware.",
