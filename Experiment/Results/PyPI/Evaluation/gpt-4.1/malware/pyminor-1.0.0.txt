      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that, during installation, decodes and executes hidden code via dynamic evaluation. Specifically, it uses a string of seemingly random characters combined with a XOR-based decryption loop to generate executable code, which is then run with eval(). This pattern is characteristic of malicious code designed to conceal its true intent, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution, remote command execution, or other malicious activities. The obfuscation and use of eval() strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to hide malicious payloads from static analysis and detection.",
