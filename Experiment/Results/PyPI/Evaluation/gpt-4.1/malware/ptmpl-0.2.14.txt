      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious behavior within the custom installation class 'GruppeInstall'. During the installation process, it performs an HTTP GET request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' and prints the response. This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to exfiltrate information about the environment or perform reconnaissance without user consent. Additionally, the code includes commented-out decryption logic and references to potentially malicious modules like 'fernet', indicating an intent to execute encrypted or obfuscated code. The overall structure suggests the code is designed to appear legitimate (a setup script) but secretly performs malicious actions during installation, classifying it as malicious.",

The remote script's content is unknown, but executing external scripts from untrusted sources is a common tactic for deploying malware, backdoors, or other malicious payloads. Overall, this behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",

Specifically, it fetches scripts named 'sys', 'build', and 'run' from a remote server and executes them with elevated privileges (using 'sudo' or setting effective UID to root). This behavior allows remote code execution, enabling the attacker to run malicious commands, install backdoors, or compromise the system entirely. The use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls further increases the risk of command injection. Overall, this code is designed to execute remote scripts without validation, making it highly malicious.",
