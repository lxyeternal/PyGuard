      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decodes and executes hidden code at runtime. Specifically, it uses a string of seemingly random characters combined with a long numeric string to generate a deobfuscated string via XOR operations. This string is then executed with `eval(compile(...))`, which can run arbitrary malicious code. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to hide its true behavior from static analysis. The code is embedded within a custom `install` command in a setup script, which could be used to infect systems during package installation. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious or backdoored Python code designed to conceal harmful actions.",
