This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the target system, potentially to download, execute, or manipulate system resources without user consent. Additionally, the code's presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution indicates malicious intent, such as malware delivery or persistence mechanisms.",
