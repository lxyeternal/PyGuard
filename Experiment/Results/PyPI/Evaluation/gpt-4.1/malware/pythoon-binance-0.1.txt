      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses dynamic import of 'pip' and 'win32com' modules, and attempts to create shortcuts, access environment variables, and manipulate files or system components in a way that suggests malicious activity such as installing packages, creating shortcuts, or executing system commands covertly. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with conditional logic that triggers system-level operations (like creating shortcuts or accessing environment variables) based on obscure, computed values, strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at stealthy system modification or malware deployment.",
