The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing harmful payloads. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package but is overshadowed by the hidden PowerShell execution, indicating malicious intent to compromise the system or establish persistence.",
