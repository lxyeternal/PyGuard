      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen, which is likely designed to download and execute malicious payloads from an external server (the URL encoded in the Base64 string). The presence of this obfuscated command, combined with the check for a specific directory ('tahg') to potentially control execution, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently in the background, which is typical of malware trying to avoid detection. The setup() call appears benign but is likely used to mask or distract from the malicious activity. Overall, the script exhibits behavior characteristic of malware, including stealthy remote code execution and obfuscation.",
