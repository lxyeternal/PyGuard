      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the target system, potentially for activities such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing persistence. Additionally, the code's presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution indicates malicious intent, despite the seemingly benign setup() call for a Python package. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing malicious payloads.",
