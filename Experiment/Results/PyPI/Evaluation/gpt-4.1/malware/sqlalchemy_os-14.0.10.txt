      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an embedded base64-encoded payload that, when decoded and executed, imports the 'os' and 'requests' modules, then makes an HTTP request to a remote server (https://cdn.discordapp.com/accounts/110946518843936425/Windows.exe). This behavior indicates an attempt to download and potentially execute malicious payloads from an external source, which is characteristic of malicious activity. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('hifromDreamyOak') and exits if found, possibly as an anti-analysis or anti-debugging measure. Overall, the code exhibits typical traits of malware or malicious scripts designed to fetch and run harmful code from the internet.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from an external URL and then executes it without any validation or user consent. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to deliver malware, ransomware, or other harmful payloads onto the victim's system. Running an external executable directly poses significant security risks, especially when the source is untrusted, making this code highly suspicious and malicious.",
