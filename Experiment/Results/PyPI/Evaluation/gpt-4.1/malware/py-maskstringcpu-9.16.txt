      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.dropbx.com/s/zgnyt9zubu0qmv/ESQUELE.EXE'), potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hinder detection and debugging. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
