      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded PowerShell command that is executed silently in the background without user consent. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated nature of the encoded string and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand'. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package, which appears legitimate but may be a cover for the malicious activity. The combination of silent PowerShell execution and obfuscation strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
