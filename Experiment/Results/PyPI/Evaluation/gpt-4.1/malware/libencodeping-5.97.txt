      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment referencing a suspicious URL ('//dl.droppbx.com/szgn9zubu0qmv/ESQEule.exe'). Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. The presence of obfuscated commands and the use of hidden window style strongly suggest malicious intent, such as malware download or execution.",
