      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'gitbh.com' embedded in the payload). Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious actions, such as installing malicious packages or establishing persistence. The use of try-except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. Overall, the code exhibits typical traits of malware, including obfuscated command execution and potential remote payload delivery.",
