      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique employed by malware to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which could be a method to avoid re-execution or detection. The setup function appears benign but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and conditional checks strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
