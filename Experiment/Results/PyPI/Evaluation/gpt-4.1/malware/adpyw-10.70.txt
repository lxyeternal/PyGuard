      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' suggests obfuscation to hide the true intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing this command, possibly to avoid detection or to run only under certain conditions. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the conditional check strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or executing hidden malicious code.",
