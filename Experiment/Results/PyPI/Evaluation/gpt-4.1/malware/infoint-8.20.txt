      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the code appears to install a Python package named 'infoint', the primary concern is the embedded PowerShell command that is likely designed to download or execute malicious content from an external source. This behavior suggests an attempt to compromise the system, exfiltrate data, or establish persistence, classifying it as malicious activity.",
