      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly sophisticated malware designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and system compromise. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- **Token and Credential Stealing:** Extracts Discord tokens, billing information, and other sensitive user data by accessing browser storage, log files, and Discord local files. It decrypts stored passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers.\n- **Data Exfiltration:** Sends collected tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data to a remote Discord webhook and uploads files to anonymous file hosting services, effectively stealing user credentials and personal information.\n- **Browser and Application Data Harvesting:** Searches common browser directories and application data folders for stored passwords, cookies, and other sensitive files, then zips and uploads them.\n- **Discord Token Hijacking:** Uses Discord API endpoints to gather user info, friends list, and billing info, and can kill Discord processes to prevent detection.\n- **Injection of Malicious Scripts:** Modifies Discord desktop client files (index.js) to inject malicious code, likely to hijack sessions or perform further malicious actions.\n- **Persistence and Startup Persistence:** Copies itself to the startup folder to ensure persistence across reboots.\n- **Remote Command and Control:** Contains functions for remote command execution, data collection, and uploading, indicating control over infected systems.\n\nOverall, this code is a comprehensive credential stealer and system infiltrator, exhibiting typical traits of malware used for espionage, account hijacking, and data theft.",
