      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden, obfuscated payload that executes a base64-encoded string which, when decoded, performs an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with the content 'niger'—likely an attempt to send a malicious or unwanted message. Additionally, the code attempts to execute arbitrary code via an 'exec' call on the decoded base64 string, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activities such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or further payload deployment. The presence of the webhook and the obfuscated execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to silently send data or control commands to an attacker-controlled server.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, imports the 'requests' module and performs an HTTP POST request to a remote server (disord.com/api/webhooks/981479916429324398/iaGKcwesxoMLmUZ5Ph-8171Tgcpqa9-QpguZdKNfv4kQYs29i_hoL01jGvu9LWGC68i). This indicates the code is designed to send data or potentially execute commands remotely, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and dynamic execution (exec) further suggests malicious intent to hide its true purpose.",
