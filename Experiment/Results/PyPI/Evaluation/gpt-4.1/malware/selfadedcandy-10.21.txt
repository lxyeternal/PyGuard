      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL-like string in the encoded command). Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious intent or to facilitate further malicious activities such as installing backdoors or malware. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the potential for malicious payload delivery classifies this code as malicious.",
