      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains embedded base64-encoded payloads that, when decoded and executed, perform malicious activities. Specifically, the code decodes base64 strings that, upon execution, attempt to download and run remote scripts or payloads from external servers, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The code also appears to be designed to evade detection by obfuscating its behavior through base64 encoding and conditional execution based on the environment (e.g., Windows detection). Overall, the code is intended to execute malicious payloads fetched from external sources, making it malicious behavior aimed at compromising the host system.",
