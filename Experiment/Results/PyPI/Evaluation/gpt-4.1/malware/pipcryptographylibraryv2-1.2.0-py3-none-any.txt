It performs extensive data theft activities, including stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and sensitive information from browsers and applications. It exfiltrates user data to remote servers via webhooks and file uploads, captures screenshots, and searches for specific files related to cryptocurrencies, wallets, and login credentials across user directories. The code also attempts to disable security measures, kill security-related processes, and persist on the system by copying itself to startup folders. Its behavior aims to compromise user privacy, steal financial and personal data, and facilitate unauthorized access or fraud, indicating clear malicious intent.",
