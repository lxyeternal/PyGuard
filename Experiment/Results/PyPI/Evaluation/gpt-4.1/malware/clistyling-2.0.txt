      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden payload that downloads and executes a ZIP archive from an external URL (https://transfer.sh/ODT39X/Updater.zip), extracts it to a system directory (C:/ProgramData/Updater), and then runs a Python script (update.py) from that location. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently install or update malicious components without user consent. Additionally, the code installs numerous Python packages, some of which could be used for malicious purposes such as network communication, encryption, or system control. The use of PowerShell commands, hidden process execution, and the silent download and extraction of external files are common tactics in malware to establish persistence, evade detection, and execute malicious payloads.",
