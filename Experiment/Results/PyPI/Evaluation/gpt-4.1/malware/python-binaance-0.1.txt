      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that serve no legitimate purpose, such as convoluted string manipulations, dynamic attribute access, and extensive use of bitwise and arithmetic operations to generate strings and variable names. It performs conditional checks based on obscure calculations, and within these conditions, it executes potentially harmful actions like installing packages via pip, creating shortcuts, deleting or saving files, and accessing system-specific features (e.g., Windows admin check, environment variables, file system operations). The obfuscation and the presence of system-level operations strongly suggest malicious intent, aiming to hide malicious activities such as privilege escalation, persistence, or data exfiltration. The code's structure and behavior are characteristic of malware or backdoor scripts designed to compromise the host system.",
