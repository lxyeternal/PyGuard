      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. The decoded payload is highly obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, but the use of `exec()` on decoded data is a common technique in malicious scripts to hide harmful actions. Such behavior typically indicates an attempt to run malicious code without detection, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
