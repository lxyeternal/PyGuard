      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a post-installation routine (_post_install) that executes during package installation. This routine performs several suspicious actions: it writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a proof message, retrieves the system's external IP address, encodes and sends this IP along with the hostname and installation path to an external domain ('kotko.org') via an HTTP GET request with a base64-encoded message. These behaviors suggest data exfiltration and potential tracking of the user system without explicit consent, which are common malicious tactics. The code's primary purpose appears to be covertly collecting and transmitting system information, indicating malicious intent.",
