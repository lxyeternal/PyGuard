      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the target machine silently, which is a classic indicator of malicious activity. The use of encrypted payloads and the concealment within a seemingly benign setup script strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution or system compromise.",
