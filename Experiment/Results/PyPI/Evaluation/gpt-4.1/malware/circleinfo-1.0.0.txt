      "malicious_behavior": "The code is heavily obfuscated and employs multiple layers of decoding and decompression, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. It dynamically reconstructs and executes a large, complex payload through the use of 'marshal.loads', 'zlib.decompress', and 'base64 decoding' on a reversed string. The payload itself is a binary blob that, once decoded, is executed via 'exec', indicating an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code. Such behavior suggests the code is designed to conceal malicious activities, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or executing further malicious scripts. Overall, this is a clear example of malicious code intended to evade detection and execute harmful operations.",
