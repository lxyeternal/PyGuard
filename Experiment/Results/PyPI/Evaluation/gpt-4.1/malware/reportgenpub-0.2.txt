      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a potentially harmful binary from a remote server. It constructs URLs dynamically based on the system architecture, fetches the binary content, decrypts it using XOR with generated keys, saves it to a hidden directory (~/.local/bin/report_gen), sets executable permissions, and then runs it in the background. This pattern indicates an attempt to stealthily install and execute malicious payloads without user awareness, which is characteristic of malware or backdoor activity.",
