      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears intentionally designed to conceal malicious behavior. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, manipulating environment variables, and traversing directories—all with convoluted and encrypted-looking code. The use of dynamic string assembly via character code calculations, conditional execution based on obscure numeric comparisons, and the creation of shortcuts or file operations suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent such as installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or executing arbitrary commands. The presence of code that interacts with system internals (like win32com and ctypes) and the obfuscation techniques strongly indicate malicious activity.",
