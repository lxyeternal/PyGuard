      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.dropx.com/s/zgnyt9zbu0qmv/ESQuele.exe'), potentially installing malware or performing other harmful actions. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which could be a method to avoid re-infection or detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional behavior strongly suggests malicious intent.",
