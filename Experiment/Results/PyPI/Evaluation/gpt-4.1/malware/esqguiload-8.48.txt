      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run potentially harmful code silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, indicating persistence or setup behavior typical of malware. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional triggers strongly indicates malicious intent, possibly for remote control, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.",
