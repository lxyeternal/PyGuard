      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is encoded in Base64 and is executed with the window hidden, indicating an intent to run malicious or unauthorized code silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data.",
