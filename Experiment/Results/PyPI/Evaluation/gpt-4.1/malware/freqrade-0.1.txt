      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded expressions. Notably, it uses the 'pip.main()' function to install packages, which is deprecated and potentially dangerous, and it manipulates system environment variables and filesystem paths. Additionally, it attempts to create shortcuts and save files in locations determined by dynamically generated paths, which could be used to execute or install malicious payloads, backdoors, or malware. The obfuscation, use of dynamic imports, environment variable access, and file operations strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at covertly executing harmful actions or establishing persistence on the host system.",
