      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes malicious code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the compromised machine, which is a clear indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further suggest malicious activity designed to evade detection.",
