      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically fetches and executes remote code from external URLs, which is a common tactic used in malicious scripts to run arbitrary and potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. Specifically, it retrieves code from 'http://files.pythonhosted.ru/version/check/ptsecurity/' concatenated with the hostname, and also from fixed URLs ('http://files.pythonhosted.ru/56788.txt' or 'http://files.pythonhosted.ru/56789.txt') depending on the platform. The use of 'exec' on content fetched over the network indicates an attempt to run code that is not inspected or controlled locally, which can lead to execution of malicious payloads such as malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. This behavior is characteristic of malicious or at least highly suspicious code designed to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions.",
