      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently. The presence of this obfuscated command suggests malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful actions. Additionally, the code's overall structure, including the use of try-except blocks to suppress errors and the obfuscated PowerShell command, further indicates malicious intent. The subsequent setup() call appears benign but is likely a decoy or part of a malicious package setup, possibly to deceive analysis or facilitate further malicious actions.",
