      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains heavily obfuscated and complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious activities. It dynamically imports modules, executes code via `exec`, and manipulates global variables and functions in a way that suggests intent to run hidden or malicious payloads. The presence of encoded strings, such as compressed or encrypted data, and the use of lambda functions with obfuscated code snippets, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. Additionally, the code executes functions with arbitrary code passed as strings, which could be used to run malicious scripts or payloads at runtime. Overall, these characteristics strongly suggest the code is malicious, likely intended to perform unauthorized actions, such as executing hidden code, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system.",
