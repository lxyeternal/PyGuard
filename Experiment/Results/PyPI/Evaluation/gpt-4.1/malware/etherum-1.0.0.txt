      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when executed on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads within the setup script, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggests malicious intent designed to infect or control the target system during installation.",
