      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window and no window style, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package named 'remc' with arbitrary metadata, which appears benign but could be used to disguise malicious activity or establish persistence. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with silent process creation strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at executing hidden malicious code or payloads.",
