      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with obfuscated payload indicates an attempt to run malicious or unauthorized code silently in the background. Overall, these behaviors suggest malicious intent, such as executing hidden payloads, potentially for remote control, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.",
