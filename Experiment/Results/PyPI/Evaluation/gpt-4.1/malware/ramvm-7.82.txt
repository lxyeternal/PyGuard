      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code silently ignores errors, which can hide failures and make detection more difficult. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and perform malicious actions without user awareness.",
