      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise or hide malicious activity, especially given the use of encoded commands and the conditional check for a specific file ('tahg') that may serve as a trigger or marker. The presence of such obfuscation and hidden execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
