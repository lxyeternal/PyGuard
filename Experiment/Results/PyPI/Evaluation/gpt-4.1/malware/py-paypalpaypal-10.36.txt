      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL-like string in the encoded command). Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to avoid suspicion. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the context suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation.",
