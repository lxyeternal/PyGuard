      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload, which is likely malicious. This behavior allows remote code execution without user awareness, enabling potential data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The obfuscated class name, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows are typical indicators of malicious intent.",
