It then periodically (every 3 hours) sends this sensitive information, along with the host's IP address and hostname, to a specified Discord webhook. This behavior constitutes credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, which are malicious activities intended to compromise user accounts and privacy.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a malicious credential and information stealer designed to extract sensitive data from the victim's system without consent. It performs several malicious actions, including: \n- Harvesting Discord tokens, user account information, email, phone number, and Nitro subscription status by scanning browser storage and Discord-related directories.\n- Extracting saved passwords and cookies from Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers.\n- Taking a screenshot of the victim's desktop.\n- Collecting system information such as IP address, location, and computer name.\n- Injecting a script into Discord processes to potentially hijack or manipulate Discord client behavior.\n- Zipping and exfiltrating all gathered data via a Discord webhook, which is used to send the information to an attacker-controlled server.\n- Attempting to log out or disrupt Discord processes.\nOverall, the code is clearly intended for malicious purposes, primarily to steal user credentials, tokens, and personal information, and then exfiltrate it to an attacker.",
