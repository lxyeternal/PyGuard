      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden payload that decrypts and executes malicious code during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it uses the 'fernet' library to decrypt an embedded encrypted payload and then executes it via 'exec()'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payloads, and execution during setup strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, malware, or other malicious components.",
