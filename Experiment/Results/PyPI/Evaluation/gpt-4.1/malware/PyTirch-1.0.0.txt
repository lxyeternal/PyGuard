      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process, executes decrypted malicious payload code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. Specifically, it decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext, then executes the resulting code with exec(). This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary malicious code silently during package installation, which can be used for malware delivery, backdoor installation, or other malicious activities. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution during setup strongly suggests malicious intent.",
