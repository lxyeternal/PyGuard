      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious trojan designed for data theft and unauthorized access. It performs extensive activities including stealing browser credentials (passwords, cookies, history, credit card info) from Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers; extracting Discord tokens and user information; capturing screenshots; collecting system information; and gathering network data such as IP and geolocation. It then compresses and exfiltrates all collected data via Discord webhooks and anonymous file hosting services. Additionally, it attempts to disable security measures, kill security-related processes, and persist by copying itself to startup folders. The code also searches for sensitive files on user directories, uploads them to external servers, and can even terminate processes like Discord to prevent detection. Overall, it is a comprehensive info-stealer and backdoor malware aimed at compromising user privacy and security.",
