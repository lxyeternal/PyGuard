      "malicious_behavior": "The code includes a custom installation routine that, upon execution, gathers sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then encodes this data and sends it via an HTTP GET request over an SSL connection to a remote server (d4d.one). This behavior resembles data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks related to the package's stated purpose and appears designed solely to secretly collect and transmit user information without consent, indicating malicious intent.",
