      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or payloads silently on the target system. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may be used as a cover for malicious activity. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command, especially with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and 'WindowStyle Hidden', indicates an intent to execute potentially harmful actions covertly, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.",
