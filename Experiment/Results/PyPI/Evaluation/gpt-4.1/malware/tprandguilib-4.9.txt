      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and may perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially with the 'Hidden' window style and no visible output, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run setup for a package named 'tprandguilib' with a seemingly legitimate description, but the core malicious activity is embedded in the PowerShell command, which is a common tactic used in malware to conceal malicious actions.",
