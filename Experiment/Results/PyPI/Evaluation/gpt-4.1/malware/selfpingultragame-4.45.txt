      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The presence of this obfuscated command suggests malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's overall structure, including the use of try-except blocks to suppress errors and the obfuscated PowerShell command, strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup function appears to be a decoy or cover, but the core malicious behavior is the silent execution of the encoded PowerShell command.",
