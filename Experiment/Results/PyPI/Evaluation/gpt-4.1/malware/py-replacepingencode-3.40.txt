      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded PowerShell command that is executed silently in the background. This command, when decoded, likely downloads and executes additional malicious payloads or performs harmful actions without user awareness. The use of 'powershell' with hidden window style and encoded commands is a common technique in malware to evade detection and execute malicious activities covertly. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious intent or facilitate further malicious distribution. Overall, the presence of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing malicious payloads or establishing persistence.",
