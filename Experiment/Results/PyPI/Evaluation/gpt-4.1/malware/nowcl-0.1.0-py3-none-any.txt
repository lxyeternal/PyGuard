It performs the following malicious actions:\n\n- Extracts Discord tokens, user data, badges, billing info, friends, and IP address by scanning browser storage, cookies, and local files, then exfiltrates this sensitive information via webhooks.\n- Decrypts stored passwords and cookies from Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox browsers, then saves and exfiltrates them.\n- Injects malicious scripts into Discord desktop applications to potentially hijack or manipulate Discord sessions.\n- Disables Windows Defender and firewall settings to evade detection.\n- Attempts to locate and steal backup codes from Discord.\n- Takes screenshots of the user's desktop and uploads them.\n- Sends all gathered data to remote webhooks, effectively compromising user accounts and system security.\n\nOverall, this code is designed for malicious data theft, system sabotage, and evasion of security measures, clearly indicating malicious intent.",
