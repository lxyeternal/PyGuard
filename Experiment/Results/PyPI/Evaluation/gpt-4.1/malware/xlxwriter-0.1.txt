      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules like 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', which are often used for system-level operations or privilege escalation. The code also constructs and executes system commands, manipulates environment variables, creates shortcuts, and interacts with the filesystem in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor behavior. The extensive use of obfuscation, meaningless variable names, and complex bitwise operations strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activities such as installing malicious packages, escalating privileges, or exfiltrating data. Overall, this code is malicious and potentially harmful.",
