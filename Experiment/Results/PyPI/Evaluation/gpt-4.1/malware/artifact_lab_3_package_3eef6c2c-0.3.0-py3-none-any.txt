It then exfiltrates this token by sending it via an HTTP POST request to an external server hosted on ngrok, a tunneling service often used to bypass network restrictions and hide malicious activity. This behavior indicates an attempt to steal sensitive credentials and exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server, which is malicious activity.",
