      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. This behavior suggests an attempt to download, execute, or perform other malicious actions covertly. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to conceal malicious activity through obfuscation and suppression of errors, indicating malicious intent.",
