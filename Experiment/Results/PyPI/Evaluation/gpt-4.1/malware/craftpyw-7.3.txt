      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other malicious actions. The use of a hidden window and encoded command suggests an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which could be a mechanism to avoid repeated execution or to check for certain system states. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to execute hidden or obfuscated commands, potentially leading to system compromise or data theft.",
