      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell command execution that downloads and executes external content from a suspicious URL (www.esquelesquad.rip). This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious payloads or malware silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise malicious activity under the guise of a benign package setup, which is a common tactic in malware distribution. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the conditional check for a specific file ('tahg') further indicates malicious intent to execute code without user awareness or consent.",
