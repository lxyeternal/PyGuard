      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated payload that decrypts and executes hidden code at runtime. It uses multiple layers of encoding, compression, and encryption (base64, base32, zlib, marshal, Fernet) to conceal its true purpose. The final step involves executing dynamically decoded code via `exec()`, which is a common technique for executing malicious payloads such as malware, backdoors, or remote code execution exploits. This behavior indicates the script is designed to run concealed malicious code, making it malicious.",
