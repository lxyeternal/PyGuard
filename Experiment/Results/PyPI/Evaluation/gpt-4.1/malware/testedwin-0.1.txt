Based on the received instructions, it can execute arbitrary shell commands, change directories, or upload files from the infected system to the attacker's server. This behavior allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised machine, execute arbitrary commands, and exfiltrate files, which are typical malicious activities associated with malware or backdoors.",
