      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads, establish unauthorized remote access, or perform other malicious activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or control execution flow. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks indicates malicious intent, potentially used for malware delivery or remote control.",
