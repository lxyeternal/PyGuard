      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes remote code fetched via a Fernet-encrypted payload, which is retrieved from an embedded key and ciphertext. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation of variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional remote code execution strongly indicate malicious intent.",
