      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment referencing a suspicious URL ('//dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zubu0qmv/Esqeule.exe'). Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with obfuscated commands is a common tactic in malware to hide malicious intent. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious activity aimed at executing arbitrary or harmful code on the host system.",
