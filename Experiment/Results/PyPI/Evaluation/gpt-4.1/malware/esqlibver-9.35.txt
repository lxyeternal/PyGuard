      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the target system, potentially to download, execute, or manipulate system resources without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, indicating an attempt to evade detection or control execution flow. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent.",
