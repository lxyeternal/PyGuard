It also sends an HTTP request containing the system's 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to a suspicious domain ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw '). This behavior indicates an attempt to silently install malicious software and exfiltrate system information, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
