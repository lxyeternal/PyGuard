      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -EncodedCommand' argument. The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payload or commands that could perform harmful actions such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing unauthorized connections. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window), which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at evading detection. The presence of such obfuscated commands and silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent, despite the seemingly benign setup() function for a Python package.",
