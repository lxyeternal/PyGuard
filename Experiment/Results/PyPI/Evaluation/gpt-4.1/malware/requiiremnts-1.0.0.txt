During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme. This behavior indicates an attempt to run hidden, potentially harmful code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated class names further suggests malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and execute arbitrary code without user awareness.",
