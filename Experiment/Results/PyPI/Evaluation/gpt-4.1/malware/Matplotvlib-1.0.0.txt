      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that executes encrypted code when run on Windows systems. Specifically, during the installation process, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted string. This behavior is typical of malware designed to silently run malicious scripts or payloads, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows strongly indicates malicious intent.",
