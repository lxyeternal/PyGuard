      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'EncodedCommand' parameter. The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payloads such as remote access, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Additionally, the code attempts to install a Python package named 'modlib' with a seemingly benign description, which could be a cover for deploying malicious modules or establishing persistence. Overall, the use of obfuscated commands and hidden execution strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or exfiltrating data.",
