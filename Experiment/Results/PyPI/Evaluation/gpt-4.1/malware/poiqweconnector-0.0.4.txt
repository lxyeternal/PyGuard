      "malicious_behavior": "The code functions as a backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT). It retrieves a port number from a DNS TXT record associated with 'poiqwe.info', then establishes a TCP connection to that server on the specified port. Once connected, it redirects the socket to standard input/output/error and spawns a bash shell, effectively granting remote control over the compromised system. Additionally, when executed as a module, it sends a GET request to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_bad', likely to notify the attacker of the infection or for tracking purposes. This behavior allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the infected machine, making it highly malicious.",

These requests could be used to download additional malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or trigger malicious actions without user consent. The presence of these network calls in setup scripts indicates an attempt to execute malicious or unwanted behavior during package installation or development setup, making this code malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code functions as a backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT). It dynamically retrieves a port number via DNS TXT records from 'poiqwe.info', then establishes a TCP connection to that server. Once connected, it redirects the socket to standard input/output/error and spawns an interactive shell ('/bin/bash'), effectively giving an attacker remote control over the compromised system. Additionally, when imported as a module, it makes a GET request to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_bad', which could be used for tracking, command-and-control signaling, or further malicious activities. Overall, this code enables unauthorized remote access and control, which is characteristic of malicious malware.",
