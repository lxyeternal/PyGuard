      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, which may serve as a decoy or to blend malicious activity with legitimate operations. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with 'powershell' and an encoded command strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence of malware, or executing other harmful actions covertly.",
