      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom install class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine silently, which is a common tactic in malware distribution. The use of encrypted payloads and the conditional execution only on Windows further indicates malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and target specific environments.",
