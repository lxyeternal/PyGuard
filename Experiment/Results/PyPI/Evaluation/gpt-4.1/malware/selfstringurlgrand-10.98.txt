      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or commands that could compromise the system, such as downloading or executing malicious files. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then runs the PowerShell command, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or ensure the payload runs only under certain conditions. The use of hidden window style and no window creation further indicates malicious intent to operate covertly. Overall, this code exhibits behaviors typical of malware, including remote command execution, obfuscation, and stealth techniques.",
