      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes an embedded payload using Fernet encryption and the requests library. This behavior suggests the code is designed to silently download and execute malicious code or perform other harmful actions without user consent. The obfuscation of variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows are common tactics used in malware to evade detection and facilitate remote control or exploitation.",
