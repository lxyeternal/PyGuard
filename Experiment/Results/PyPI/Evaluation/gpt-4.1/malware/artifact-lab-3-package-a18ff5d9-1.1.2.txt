This behavior occurs during the installation or development setup process, which can be triggered automatically when the package is installed or developed. Such activity can be used to gather sensitive information, such as environment variables, credentials, or other system details, without user consent. The use of a potentially malicious URL (an ngrok tunnel) further indicates malicious intent, as it suggests the attacker is attempting to receive the stolen data remotely.",
