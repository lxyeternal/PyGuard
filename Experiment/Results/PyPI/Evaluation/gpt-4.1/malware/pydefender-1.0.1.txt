It decodes and executes embedded base64-encoded payloads, which likely contain malicious code such as malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. The code's structure suggests it dynamically reconstructs and runs hidden code, making it very likely to perform harmful actions such as unauthorized data access, remote command execution, or system compromise. Overall, this code is malicious and designed to evade detection while executing malicious payloads.",

This behavior is often associated with malicious or intrusive activities, especially if the webhook URL is controlled by an attacker. The code does not perform any legitimate or transparent function related to package installation, and the use of a webhook to report installations indicates potential malicious intent to monitor or log user activity covertly.",

It appears to reconstruct and execute hidden payloads, likely malicious scripts or commands, by decoding base64-encoded strings and executing them dynamically. The code's structure suggests it is designed to conceal its true purpose, which could include executing arbitrary code, downloading or installing malware, or establishing unauthorized access.

The code does not perform any harmful actions directly (such as deleting files, executing arbitrary code, or exfiltrating sensitive data), but its purpose of silently notifying an external server about package installation is suspicious and can be considered malicious in context.",
