      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits typical characteristics of a data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) malware. It collects system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, encodes this data, and then transmits it covertly via DNS queries (using 'ping' commands with specially crafted domain names) and HTTP requests to external domains. The data is split into multiple parts, encoded in hexadecimal, and embedded within domain names or HTTP request parameters, making detection difficult. The use of DNS queries and HTTP requests to external servers to send system information indicates malicious intent, likely aimed at stealthily exfiltrating sensitive data or maintaining communication with a remote attacker.",
