      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is often used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is run with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to operate covertly. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation combined with silent execution strongly suggests malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to run this hidden command before proceeding to a seemingly benign setup process, which could be a tactic to hide malicious actions within legitimate code. Overall, this behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to evade detection and perform harmful operations.",
