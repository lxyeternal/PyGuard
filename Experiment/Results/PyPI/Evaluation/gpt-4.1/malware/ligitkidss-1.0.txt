      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a remote script from a URL ('https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw') without any validation or user consent. It writes this script to a temporary file and then attempts to execute it using the system's default executable, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host machine. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it allows an attacker to run arbitrary code remotely, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious actions.",
