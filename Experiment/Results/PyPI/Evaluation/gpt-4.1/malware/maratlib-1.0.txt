      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated functions that dynamically decode and evaluate code snippets at runtime using complex string manipulations and eval(). The presence of large, nonsensical variable names, base64-like strings, and runtime code execution strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads. The functions 'l111ll1l_lol_' and 'l1ll1ll11_lol_' decode obfuscated strings and execute them, which is a common technique in malware to load or execute malicious code dynamically. Additionally, the code imports 'sys' and performs version checks, possibly to adapt behavior based on the environment, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, this code appears designed to conceal malicious activities such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise.",
