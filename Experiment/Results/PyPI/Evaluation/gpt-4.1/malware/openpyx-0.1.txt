      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses dynamic import of 'pip' and 'win32com' modules, and attempts to create shortcuts, delete files, or access system resources in a manner typical of malware. The presence of code that calls 'pip.main()' to install packages, and 'win32com' to interact with Windows COM objects, suggests it may attempt to install malicious packages or manipulate system components. Additionally, the code's obfuscation and use of dynamic attribute access strongly indicate an intent to conceal malicious behavior, such as installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or executing arbitrary code. Overall, this code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious scripts designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions.",
