      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads or activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, suggesting an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The PowerShell command is likely designed to download or execute malicious content from an external source, as indicated by the URL-like string embedded in the encoded command. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
