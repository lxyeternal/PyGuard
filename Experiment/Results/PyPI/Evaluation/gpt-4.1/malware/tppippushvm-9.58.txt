      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and runs with hidden window style, indicating an intent to operate covertly. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation combined with the silent execution suggests malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute harmful payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code's overall structure, including the silent import and setup, further supports the suspicion of malicious activity.",
