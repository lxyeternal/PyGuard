      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. During installation, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched from an external source (via the 'requests' library) using the Fernet symmetric encryption. This behavior allows remote code execution, which can be exploited to run arbitrary malicious commands, install malware, or compromise the host system. The obfuscation, use of encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at covertly compromising systems during package installation.",
