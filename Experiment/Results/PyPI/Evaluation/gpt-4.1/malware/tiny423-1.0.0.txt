      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds a base64-encoded command that, when executed during the installation process, performs an HTTP request to a specified URL (http://192.168.1.3:8000/test.txt) using the os.system call. This behavior suggests an attempt to contact a remote server, potentially for malicious purposes such as exfiltrating data, downloading additional payloads, or establishing a command-and-control channel. The execution occurs during the 'install' phase, which is a common tactic for malicious Python packages to execute harmful code without explicit user awareness. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent by executing remote communication during package installation.",
