      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. The use of hidden process creation and obfuscated commands strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
