      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized actions on the system, which is characteristic of malicious activity. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions, further hiding its malicious intent or errors, and the presence of a suspicious URL comment ('//dl.drobx.com/szgn9t8bu0qmv/Esqeule.exe') suggests it may be involved in downloading or executing malicious payloads.",
