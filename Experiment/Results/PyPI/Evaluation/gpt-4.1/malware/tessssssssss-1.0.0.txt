      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during the package installation process, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker (indicated by the suspicious domain). This behavior resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance, which is typical of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function beyond the standard setup process, and the external request is likely intended to gather information without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
