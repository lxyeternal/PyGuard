      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given its obfuscated nature. Additionally, the code silently ignores exceptions, which can hide failures or malicious activity. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system, download malware, or establish unauthorized access.",
