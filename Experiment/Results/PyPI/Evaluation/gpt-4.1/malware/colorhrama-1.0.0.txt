      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated malicious behavior embedded within a custom installation class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet encryption, which is likely to be malicious code. The use of encrypted payloads, conditional execution based on OS, and the obfuscation techniques strongly suggest an intent to conceal malicious activities such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions. The code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run malicious code during package installation, making it highly suspicious and malicious.",
