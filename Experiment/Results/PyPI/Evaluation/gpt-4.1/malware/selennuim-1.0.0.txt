      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted string, which is likely to be malicious. This behavior enables the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine without explicit user consent, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation of variable and class names further indicates malicious intent to evade detection.",
