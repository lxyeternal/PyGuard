This behavior is characteristic of malware or malicious scripts designed to deliver and run malicious payloads on the victim's system. The URL points to a file named 'pics.exe', which is likely an arbitrary or misleading filename, further indicating malicious intent. Running external executables without verification poses significant security risks, including remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise.",
