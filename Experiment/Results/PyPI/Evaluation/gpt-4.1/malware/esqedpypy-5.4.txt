      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The specific Base64-encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, as suggested by the comment referencing a suspicious URL ('www.esquelesquad.rip') and the obfuscated nature of the command. Additionally, the code includes a setup function that appears legitimate but is wrapped in a try-except block, possibly to mask its presence or prevent errors from halting execution. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, such as downloading, executing, or maintaining persistence of malicious payloads.",
