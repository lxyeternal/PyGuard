      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using the exec() function. The decoded payload imports modules such as 'tempfile', 'sys', 'os', and 'urllib.request', and performs network requests to URLs like 'https://pst.klgtrg.io/paste/7bupb/ram', potentially to download or execute malicious content. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code fetched from external sources, which is a common tactic in malware to evade detection and execute malicious payloads at runtime. The presence of such obfuscated code and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an embedded base64-encoded payload that, when decoded and executed, attempts to perform network requests to 'https://pst.klgtrg.io/paste/7bupb/raw' and reads the content of the URL. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or remote command/control capabilities. Additionally, the code dynamically imports modules, manipulates terminal display, and includes obfuscated or developer-oriented functions, which are common tactics to hide malicious intent. The presence of code that executes decoded base64 data via 'exec' indicates malicious activity, potentially allowing remote code execution or data theft.",
