      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or behavior, such as downloading or executing malicious code, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks indicates malicious intent, potentially used for remote control, persistence, or data theft.",
