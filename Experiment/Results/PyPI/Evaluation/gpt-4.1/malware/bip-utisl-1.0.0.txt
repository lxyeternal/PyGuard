      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet encryption. This behavior suggests the presence of malicious activity, such as downloading and executing malicious code or payloads covertly during installation. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows indicates an attempt to evade detection and target specific environments, which are common tactics in malicious software. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent by executing potentially harmful code during setup.",
