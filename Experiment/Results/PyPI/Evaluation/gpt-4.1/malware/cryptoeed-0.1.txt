      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that serve no legitimate purpose, such as extensive use of nested and meaningless calculations, dynamic attribute access, and convoluted control flow. It dynamically imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', and performs operations such as creating shortcuts, checking for administrative privileges, and manipulating files and directories. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to evade detection, escalate privileges, or execute harmful payloads. The presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system modifications strongly indicates malicious intent, likely aiming to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions.",
