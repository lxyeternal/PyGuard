      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed as a malicious Discord rat (Remote Access Trojan) that performs several harmful actions. It extracts Discord tokens from various browsers and applications, decrypts encrypted tokens, and sends them to a specified Discord webhook. It also includes commands to take screenshots, download and execute files from external links, and simulate keyboard input, all of which can be used for spying, data theft, or remote control. The code hides its console window to evade detection and actively collects sensitive user data without consent, indicating malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to perform multiple malicious activities. It secretly extracts stored Discord tokens from various browsers and applications by reading local storage files and decrypting encrypted tokens using Windows cryptography functions. It then sends these tokens, along with a screenshot of the user's desktop, to a specified Discord webhook. Additionally, it sets up a local web server and exposes it via ngrok, potentially allowing remote access to the compromised machine. Overall, the script aims to steal user credentials and provide remote control capabilities, which are typical malicious behaviors.",
