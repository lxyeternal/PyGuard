      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs network requests to external URLs that are likely controlled by an attacker (as indicated by the domain 'oastify.com', a known platform for security testing and tracking). The first request is sent immediately, and after a 60-second delay, a second request is made. This pattern suggests the code is used for tracking, exfiltration, or establishing a covert communication channel with an attacker-controlled server. The delay may be intended to evade detection or to synchronize with other malicious activities. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or remote command and control.",
