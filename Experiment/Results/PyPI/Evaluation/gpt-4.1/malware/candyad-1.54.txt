      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the exact payload is encoded, such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious payloads, or to establish persistence or communication channels. The presence of this obfuscated command execution without clear legitimate purpose classifies this code as malicious.",
