      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decrypts and executes hidden code at runtime. It uses XOR decryption with a long numeric key to conceal its true intent. The decrypted code is then dynamically compiled and executed via `eval(compile(...))`, which is a common technique to hide malicious actions such as downloading, executing, or manipulating files, or establishing unauthorized connections. This pattern strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to evade static analysis and execute potentially harmful operations without immediate detection.",
