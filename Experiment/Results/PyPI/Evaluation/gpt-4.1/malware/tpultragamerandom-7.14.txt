      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely designed to perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing unauthorized connections, or other malicious activities. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a seemingly obfuscated command indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window) without user awareness. The presence of such obfuscated PowerShell execution is a common tactic in malicious scripts to evade detection and perform harmful operations.",
