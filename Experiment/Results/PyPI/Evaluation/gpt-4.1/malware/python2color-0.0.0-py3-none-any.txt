      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious trojan designed for information theft and unauthorized access. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n1. **Credential and Data Harvesting:**\n   - Extracts Discord tokens, user account information, email, phone number, and public flags.\n   - Retrieves browser-stored passwords, cookies, and tokens from Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and Discord.\n   - Accesses saved login data and cookies from various browsers, decrypting encrypted data.\n   - Collects data from other applications like Steam, Exodus, and Riot Client.\n   - Searches user directories for files containing sensitive keywords (e.g., passwords, accounts, crypto wallets) and zips them.\n\n2. **Token Stealing and Validation:**\n   - Extracts Discord tokens from log files and other sources.\n   - Validates tokens by making API requests to Discord.\n   - Gathers detailed user info, including email, avatar, badges, Nitro status, and friends list.\n\n3. **Credential Uploading:**\n   - Sends all collected tokens, passwords, cookies, and files to a remote webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating user data.\n   - Uploads files to anonymous file hosting services and shares download links via webhook.\n\n4. **Browser and Application Data Collection:**\n   - Searches common browser directories for stored data.\n   - Collects and zips wallet files, game data, and other application files.\n   - Kills processes of targeted applications before copying files to ensure access.\n\n5. **Persistence and Self-Replication:**\n   - Copies itself to the startup folder to ensure persistence.\n\n6. **Webhooks and External Communication:**\n   - Fetches webhook URLs from external sources.\n   - Sends all stolen data, including tokens, passwords, cookies, and files, to these webhooks.\n\n7. **Additional Malicious Features:**\n   - Downloads and injects JavaScript code into Discord desktop files for further exploitation.\n   - Implements basic anti-analysis checks such as blacklists for usernames, hostnames, MAC addresses, HWIDs, and IP addresses.\n\nOverall, this code is a comprehensive info-stealer trojan with capabilities to extract sensitive user data, validate and exfiltrate Discord tokens, steal passwords and cookies, collect files, and maintain persistence—all characteristic behaviors of malicious malware designed for theft, espionage, and unauthorized access.",
