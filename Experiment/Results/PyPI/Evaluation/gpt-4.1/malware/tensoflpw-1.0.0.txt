      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from a Fernet-encrypted payload embedded directly in the script. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, which is a classic malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows are typical indicators of malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and compromise the system during package installation.",
