      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing harmful payloads. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup operation, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as establishing persistence, downloading malware, or exfiltrating data without user consent.",
