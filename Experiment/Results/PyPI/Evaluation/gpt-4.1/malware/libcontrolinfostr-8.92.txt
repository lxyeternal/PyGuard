      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zbu0qmv/ESQUELE.EXE'), potentially installing malware or performing unauthorized actions on the victim's system. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly legitimate Python package setup, which may serve as a decoy or to avoid suspicion, but the core malicious behavior is the hidden PowerShell execution designed to run malicious code silently.",
