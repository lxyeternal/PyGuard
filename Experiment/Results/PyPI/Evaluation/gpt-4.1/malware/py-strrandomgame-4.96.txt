      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. The script also checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if the file does not exist, which can be used to evade detection or re-infection. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run potentially harmful PowerShell commands, indicating malicious intent such as remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration.",
