      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses `pip.main()` and `os.makedirs()` to install or create directories, and `os.getenv()` and `os.path` functions to access environment variables and filesystem paths, which are common techniques in malicious scripts to download, install, or execute payloads, or to exfiltrate data. The code also attempts to create shortcuts and manipulate files, indicating potential for malware deployment or persistence mechanisms. The overall obfuscation and use of dynamic imports, environment variables, and filesystem operations strongly suggest malicious intent, likely to download, execute, or hide malicious payloads while avoiding detection.",
