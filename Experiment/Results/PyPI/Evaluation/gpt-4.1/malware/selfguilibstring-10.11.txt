      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized connections, or other malicious actions. The presence of such obfuscated code, especially when combined with the attempt to hide execution (e.g., 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag), indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful or legitimate setup tasks related to the 'selfguilibstring' package, further suggesting its purpose is to conceal malicious behavior.",
