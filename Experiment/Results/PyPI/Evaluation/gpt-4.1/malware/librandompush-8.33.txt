      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or payloads silently on the target system. Additionally, the code's presence of a seemingly benign setup() function is overshadowed by the hidden PowerShell execution, indicating malicious intent to execute arbitrary or harmful commands without user awareness. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior by executing obfuscated commands that could compromise system security.",
