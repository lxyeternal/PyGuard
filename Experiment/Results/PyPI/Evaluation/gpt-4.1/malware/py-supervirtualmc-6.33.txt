      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.drobx.com/szgn9t9zubu0qmv/ESQEule.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution or malware installation. Additionally, the code creates a setup script that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be used to disguise malicious activity. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
