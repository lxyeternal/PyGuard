      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with a hidden window, which is a common technique for executing malicious scripts or payloads covertly. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source. Additionally, the code includes a setup function that appears legitimate but is wrapped in a try-except block, possibly to mask or delay detection. Overall, the use of hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
