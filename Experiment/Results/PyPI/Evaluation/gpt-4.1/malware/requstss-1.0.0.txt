      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet encryption. This payload is likely malicious, as it is hidden within encrypted data and executed dynamically, which can be used to run arbitrary malicious code, download additional malware, or perform unauthorized actions. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution during installation are common indicators of malicious intent.",
