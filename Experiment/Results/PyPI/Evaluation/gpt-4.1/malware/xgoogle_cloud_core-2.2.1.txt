      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits typical characteristics of a data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication mechanism. It collects system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, encodes this data, and then transmits it covertly via DNS queries (using 'ping' commands with specially crafted domain names) and HTTP requests to external domains. The DNS-based transmission encodes data into subdomains, which can be used to stealthily exfiltrate data or receive commands without raising suspicion. The use of base64 encoding, splitting data into parts, and multiple HTTP requests further indicates an attempt to evade detection and maintain persistent communication with a remote server. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious malware designed for data theft or remote control, confirming the code's malicious intent.",
