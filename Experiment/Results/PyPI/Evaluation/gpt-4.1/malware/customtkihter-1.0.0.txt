      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes remote code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary malicious code silently during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated class names further suggests malicious intent to evade detection.",
