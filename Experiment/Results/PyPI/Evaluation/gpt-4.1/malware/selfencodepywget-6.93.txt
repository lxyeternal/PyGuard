      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely designed to download and execute malicious content from an external source, as indicated by the URL segment 'dl.droppbx.com' embedded in the encoded command. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' suggests an attempt to run malicious code stealthily without user awareness. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package named 'selfencodepywget' with seemingly legitimate metadata, which may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. Overall, the code exhibits typical behaviors of malware, including covert remote code execution and obfuscation.",
