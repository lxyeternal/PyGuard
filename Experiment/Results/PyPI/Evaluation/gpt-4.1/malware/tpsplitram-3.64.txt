      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or download/execute further payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious activity. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the silent execution with hidden window strongly indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware download.",
