      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious intent. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent subprocess invocation strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden or malicious code without user awareness.",
