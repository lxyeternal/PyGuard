      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `send()` that, during installation, attempts to retrieve system environment information (`COMPUTERNAME`) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (`https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation <COMPUTERNAME>`). Additionally, it downloads and executes an executable file (`ini_file_pyp_41.exe`) from a suspicious URL (`https://python-release.com/python-install.scr`) and runs it using `os.system`. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it involves exfiltration of system information and executing potentially harmful payloads without user consent, which are common tactics in malware or remote access trojans (RATs).",
