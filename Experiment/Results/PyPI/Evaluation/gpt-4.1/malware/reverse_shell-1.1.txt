      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several actions indicative of malicious intent. It clones a GitHub repository and executes a script named 'bypass.py', which could contain malicious payloads such as reverse shells or backdoors. Additionally, it sends a notification to a Discord webhook indicating that a 'reverse_shell' package has been installed, which suggests the code is designed to establish or facilitate unauthorized remote access. The combination of cloning external repositories, executing potentially malicious scripts, and notifying an attacker via Discord webhook strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistent remote control or backdoor access on the compromised system.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It clones a remote GitHub repository without user consent, potentially downloading malicious payloads or backdoors. It then executes a script named 'bypass.py' from the cloned repository, which could contain malicious code designed to bypass security measures, establish unauthorized access, or perform other harmful activities. Additionally, it sends a notification to a Discord webhook indicating that a 'reverse_shell' package has been installed, suggesting the code may be used to establish reverse shells or remote access. Overall, these behaviors—unauthorized repository cloning, execution of external scripts, and notification of potentially malicious activity—are characteristic of malicious software aimed at compromising system security and maintaining covert control.",
