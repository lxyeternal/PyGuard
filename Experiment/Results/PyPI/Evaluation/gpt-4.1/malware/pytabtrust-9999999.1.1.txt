Additionally, it attempts to fetch data from another URL (https://vulnerable.bfad8061.pwnie.me) using curl, which could be used for further malicious activities or command execution. The code is embedded within a setup script, making it likely to execute during package installation, thus facilitating covert data exfiltration and potential remote control or further malicious actions.",
