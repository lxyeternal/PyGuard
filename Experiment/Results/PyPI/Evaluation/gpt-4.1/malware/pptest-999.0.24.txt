      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system information and perform covert DNS-based data exfiltration. It gathers hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and WAN IP address, then encodes this data into a payload. The payload is converted into a hex string and split into chunks, which are sent via DNS A-record queries to a specified domain (tkhifq33bf1r414tr9fqnn06txznnc.burpcollaborator.net). This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration malware or command-and-control (C2) communication channels, allowing an attacker to extract sensitive system information covertly. Additionally, the code appears to be part of a setup script, which could be used to disguise malicious activity under the guise of a legitimate package installation. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent by secretly transmitting system data over DNS queries.",

It constructs a payload containing system information such as hostname, current working directory, WAN IP address, and local IP addresses. This payload is then hashed and encoded into a hexadecimal string, which is segmented into chunks and sent via DNS queries to a specified domain (fake_domain). This technique leverages DNS resolution as a covert channel, allowing an attacker to extract system information stealthily. The presence of a hardcoded domain, encoding of system info into DNS queries, and the commented-out warning message about reinstalling pip suggest malicious intent, likely for reconnaissance or data theft without alerting traditional security measures.",
