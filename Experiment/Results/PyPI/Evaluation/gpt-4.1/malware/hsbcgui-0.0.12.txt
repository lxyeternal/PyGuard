This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity, as it can be used to deliver malware, backdoors, or other harmful payloads onto the victim's machine without user consent or awareness. The code does not perform any legitimate or transparent function related to the stated project, and the external download is hidden within the installation process, which is a common tactic used by malware to compromise systems.",
