      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other malicious actions. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a base64-encoded string suggests obfuscation to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can be used to avoid detection or debugging. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command execution is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, potentially aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence.",
