      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or commands that could perform harmful actions such as downloading, executing, or manipulating system files without user consent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or control execution flow. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional behavior indicates malicious intent, potentially used for remote code execution, persistence, or other malicious activities.",
