      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely designed to perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a hidden window and the obfuscated command strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this payload only if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, possibly to avoid detection or repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated and hidden execution mechanisms is characteristic of malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system.",
