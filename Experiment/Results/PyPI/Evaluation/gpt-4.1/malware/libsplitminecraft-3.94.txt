      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code's presence of such obfuscated execution indicates malicious intent, as it bypasses normal code review and security measures. The setup function appears benign but is likely used as a decoy or to mask malicious activity.",
