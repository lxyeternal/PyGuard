      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function and module names using extensive string and bitwise operations, which is a common obfuscation technique. The code conditionally executes potentially harmful actions such as installing packages via pip, creating shortcuts, manipulating files, or executing system commands, often based on obscure or manipulated conditions. The presence of code that attempts to escalate privileges (e.g., checking for admin rights) and the use of dynamic, obfuscated string construction strongly suggest malicious intent, likely aiming to evade detection and perform unauthorized system modifications or data exfiltration.",
