      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, as it can be used to run arbitrary, potentially harmful commands or payloads silently in the background. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique in malware to obfuscate malicious scripts and evade detection. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which further suggests an intent to hide malicious actions. The presence of this behavior, especially without legitimate context, classifies the code as malicious.",
