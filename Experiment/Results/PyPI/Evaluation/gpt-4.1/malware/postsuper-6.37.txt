      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code silently ignores errors, which can conceal failures and hinder detection. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common technique used to evade detection and perform malicious actions on the target system.",
