      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or download/execute further payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware download. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior due to its covert execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands.",
