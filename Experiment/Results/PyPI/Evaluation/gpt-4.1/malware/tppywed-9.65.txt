      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious activity. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common technique used to evade detection and deliver malware.",
