      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme. This behavior suggests an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated class names further indicates malicious intent to evade detection. Overall, this code is designed to surreptitiously execute malicious code during setup, making it malicious.",
