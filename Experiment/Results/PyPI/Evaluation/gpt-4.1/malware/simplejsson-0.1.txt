      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules like 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', which are often used for system-level operations or privilege escalation. The code also constructs and executes system commands, manipulates files, and interacts with system components such as creating shortcuts, checking for administrator privileges, and walking through directories. The extensive use of obfuscation, dynamic attribute access, and complex calculations strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, such as installing malware, escalating privileges, or exfiltrating data. Overall, this code exhibits characteristics typical of malware or malicious scripts, and it should be considered dangerous.",
