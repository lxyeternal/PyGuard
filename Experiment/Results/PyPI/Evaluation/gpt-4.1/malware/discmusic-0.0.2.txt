It then executes this file immediately. This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it involves downloading and executing potentially harmful code without user consent or awareness. The use of a common system filename ('explorer.exe') and the obfuscated download URL further suggest malicious intent, aiming to disguise the malicious executable as a legitimate system process and evade detection.",
