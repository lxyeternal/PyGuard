      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing malicious content without user consent. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' indicates an attempt to evade detection and run covertly. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package but the embedded PowerShell command suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware download.",
