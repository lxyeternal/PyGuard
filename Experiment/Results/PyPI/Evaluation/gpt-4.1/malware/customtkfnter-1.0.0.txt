      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when executed on a Windows system, decrypts and executes a payload embedded within the script. Specifically, it uses the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme to decrypt a hardcoded encrypted string and then executes the resulting code via `exec()`. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code, as it attempts to hide its payload and execute arbitrary code during installation, which can be used for malicious activities such as installing backdoors, malware, or executing harmful commands without user awareness.",
