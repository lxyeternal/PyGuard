      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely fetches or runs malicious code from an external source. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to execute hidden, potentially harmful code without user awareness.",
