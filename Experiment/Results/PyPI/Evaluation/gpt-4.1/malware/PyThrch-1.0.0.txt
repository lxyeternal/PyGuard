      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads, potentially allowing remote code execution or data exfiltration. The use of encrypted payloads and the obfuscated class and variable names further indicate malicious intent, as legitimate setup scripts typically do not perform such actions. Overall, this code is designed to surreptitiously run malicious code during package installation, making it malicious.",
