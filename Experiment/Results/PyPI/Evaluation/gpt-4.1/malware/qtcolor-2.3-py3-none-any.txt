      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decodes and executes hidden code at runtime. It uses XOR decryption with a key to conceal its true intent, which is typical of malicious scripts. Additionally, it deletes its own source file after execution (`os.remove(os.path.abspath(__file__))`), a behavior often associated with malware attempting to cover its tracks. The use of `eval(compile(...))` on dynamically decrypted code further indicates malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution. Overall, this script is designed to hide malicious operations and then erase traces of its presence, confirming it as malicious.",
