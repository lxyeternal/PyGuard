      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded and obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses dynamic import of 'pip' and 'win32com' modules, and attempts to create shortcuts, access environment variables, and manipulate files or system resources in a way that suggests malicious activity such as installing packages, creating shortcuts, or modifying system files. The presence of code that interacts with system-specific modules (win32com, ctypes.windll.shell32) and the obfuscation strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden operations, potentially to compromise the system or install malicious payloads.",
