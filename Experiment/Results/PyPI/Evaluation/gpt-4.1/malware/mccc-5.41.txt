      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The encoded command is hidden and obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, which is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, preventing detection of errors that could reveal malicious intent. The setup function appears legitimate but may be used as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious actions. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
