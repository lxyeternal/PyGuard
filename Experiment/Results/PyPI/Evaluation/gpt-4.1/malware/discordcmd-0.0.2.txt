      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically decoded payloads, including base64-encoded data and eval statements, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. Specifically, it decodes and executes potentially harmful code from an encoded string, which could perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or other malicious activities. The presence of multiple eval calls with obfuscated strings and the execution of decoded code strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at hiding its true purpose and executing arbitrary code on the host system.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically decoded payloads, including base64-encoded data and eval statements, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. Specifically, it decodes and executes code from a base64 string, which is a common technique used to hide malicious actions such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Additionally, the code constructs strings and evaluates them dynamically, further obscuring its true purpose. The presence of these obfuscation techniques strongly suggests that the script is designed to perform malicious activities, potentially executing harmful code without user awareness.",
