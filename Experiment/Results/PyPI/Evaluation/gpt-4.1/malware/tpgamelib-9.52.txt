      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the host system, potentially for purposes such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing other harmful actions. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially without clear legitimate purpose, indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the embedded PowerShell command is a significant red flag for malicious activity.",
