Additionally, it downloads and executes an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') from a potentially malicious URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') using `os.system`. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system information and execute arbitrary code, which are common malicious activities designed to compromise the host system.",
