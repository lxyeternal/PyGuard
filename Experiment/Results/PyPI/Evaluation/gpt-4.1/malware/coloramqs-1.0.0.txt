      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code using Fernet encryption. This behavior is hidden within the setup script and is only triggered during installation, making it a form of malicious payload delivery. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution suggests an intent to conceal malicious activities, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation, from casual inspection.",
