This behavior indicates an attempt to run potentially malicious software on the host system without user consent or awareness. The use of 'start Cleaner.exe' with 'set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker' suggests an effort to bypass User Account Control (UAC) prompts or elevate privileges stealthily. Such actions are characteristic of malware or malicious payload delivery, making this code malicious.",
