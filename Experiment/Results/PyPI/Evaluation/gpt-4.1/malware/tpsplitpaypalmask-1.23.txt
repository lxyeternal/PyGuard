      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded PowerShell command that is executed silently in the background without user consent. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command. Additionally, the code attempts to install a Python package named 'tpsplitpaypalmask' with a seemingly benign description, which could be a cover for malicious activity such as establishing persistence, exfiltrating data, or further downloading malicious components. The use of try-except blocks to suppress errors further suggests an attempt to hide malicious actions or obfuscate the code's true intent. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malware, including stealthy command execution and potential payload delivery.",
