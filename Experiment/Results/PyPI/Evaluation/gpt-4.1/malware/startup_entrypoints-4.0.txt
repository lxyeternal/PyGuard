This behavior can be used to exfiltrate system information (the hostname) to an attacker-controlled server. The downloaded file is saved locally as 'image.png', which may be used for further malicious activities or to appear innocuous. The code executes this download automatically upon package installation, making it a form of malicious behavior aimed at data exfiltration or tracking without user consent.",
