      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is run with hidden window options, indicating an intent to operate covertly. Although the specific payload is not directly visible, the use of encoded commands and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's behavior of silently executing potentially harmful commands without user consent or transparency confirms malicious activity.",
