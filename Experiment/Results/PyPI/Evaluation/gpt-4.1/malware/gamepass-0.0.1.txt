      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious information-stealing malware designed to extract sensitive user data from the victim's system. It performs multiple malicious activities, including:\n\n- Detecting debugging or virtual machine environments to evade analysis.\n- Stealing Discord tokens, user account information, billing details, friends list, and badges by accessing browser storage, local files, and Discord application data.\n- Extracting stored passwords and cookies from Chrome, Edge, Brave, Yandex, and Opera browsers.\n- Collecting browser extension data, wallet information, and other sensitive files based on predefined keywords.\n- Zipping and uploading collected files to external servers (e.g., gofile.io) and sharing download links.\n- Sending detailed user information, including IP address, email, phone, and system info, to a remote webhook (Discord webhook URL embedded in the code).\n- Persisting itself by copying to startup folders to ensure persistence across reboots.\n- Potentially executing further malicious scripts or injections via injected JavaScript code.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to covertly harvest personal and financial data, tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information, then exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled servers, making it a clear example of a malicious info-stealer malware.",
