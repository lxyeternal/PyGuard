      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within the `send()` function, which is executed during the installation process via a custom `PostInstallCommand`. Specifically, it performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Data Exfiltration:** It retrieves the environment variable `COMPUTERNAME` and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server (`https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw <COMPUTERNAME>`). This can be used to identify and track infected machines.\n\n2. **Downloading and Executing Malicious Payload:** If the platform is Windows (`win32`), it downloads an executable file (`ini_file_pyp_41.exe`) from a remote URL (`https://python-release.com/python-install.scr`) and executes it using `os.system()`. This allows the attacker to run arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to malware installation, remote access, or other harmful activities.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to surreptitiously collect system information and download and execute malicious payloads, which are classic behaviors associated with malware and malicious software distribution.",
