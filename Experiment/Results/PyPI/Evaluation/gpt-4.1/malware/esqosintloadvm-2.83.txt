      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing a backdoor. The use of obfuscation and hidden process creation strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or maintaining persistence.",
