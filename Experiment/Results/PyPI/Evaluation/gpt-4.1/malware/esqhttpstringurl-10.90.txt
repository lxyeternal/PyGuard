      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command string. Additionally, the code attempts to run a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious activities or to establish persistence. Overall, the presence of obfuscated command execution and silent process creation strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing unauthorized actions.",
