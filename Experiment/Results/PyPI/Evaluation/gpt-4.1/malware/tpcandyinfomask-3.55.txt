      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download, execute, or perform other malicious activities without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then proceeds to run the PowerShell command, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or ensure the payload runs only under certain conditions. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and the hidden window flag ('-WindowStyle Hidden') are common techniques in malicious scripts to conceal malicious operations. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or malware download.",
