      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears designed to hide malicious activities. It performs several suspicious operations, including dynamically importing modules like 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', which are often used for system-level manipulations. The code also constructs and executes system commands, manipulates files, creates shortcuts, and interacts with environment variables, all through heavily obfuscated and convoluted expressions. These behaviors suggest an intent to perform malicious actions such as installing packages, escalating privileges, or executing arbitrary code while avoiding detection. The use of obfuscation, dynamic imports, and system modifications strongly indicates malicious intent.",
