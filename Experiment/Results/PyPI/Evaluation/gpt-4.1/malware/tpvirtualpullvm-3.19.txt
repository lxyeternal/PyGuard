      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. This behavior suggests an attempt to download, execute, or perform other malicious actions covertly. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks to suppress errors and the presence of suspicious comments (e.g., 'www.esquelesquad.rip') further indicate malicious intent. The setup function appears benign but is likely used as a decoy or to blend malicious activity within legitimate package setup procedures.",
