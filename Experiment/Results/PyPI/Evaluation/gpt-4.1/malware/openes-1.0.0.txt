      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via Fernet encryption. Specifically, during the installation process, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload and executes it with 'exec'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery. The obfuscated variable names and encrypted payload further suggest malicious intent, aiming to hide malicious activities from casual inspection.",
