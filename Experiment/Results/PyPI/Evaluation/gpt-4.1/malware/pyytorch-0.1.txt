      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded and obfuscated expressions. Notably, it attempts to import modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', and conditionally executes code that can install packages, create shortcuts, or manipulate files and system settings. The presence of code that interacts with system directories, checks for administrator privileges, and creates shortcuts suggests malicious behavior such as installing malware, executing arbitrary code, or compromising system security. The obfuscation and use of dynamic code execution strongly indicate malicious intent rather than benign functionality.",
