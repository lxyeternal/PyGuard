      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with the window hidden, indicating an intent to run potentially harmful or unauthorized code silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, suggesting conditional malicious activity. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional triggers strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing unauthorized remote access.",
