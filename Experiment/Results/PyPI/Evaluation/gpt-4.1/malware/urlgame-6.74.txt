      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious activity. The use of hidden process creation and obfuscated commands strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
