      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely fetches and runs malicious code from an external source. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious intent or to facilitate persistence or further malicious actions under the guise of a legitimate package. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the potential for malicious payload delivery classifies this code as malicious.",
