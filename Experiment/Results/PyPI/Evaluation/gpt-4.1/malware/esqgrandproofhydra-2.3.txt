      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code silently suppresses errors, which can hide malicious behavior or hinder detection. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and the conditional execution based on a file's absence are common tactics in malware to evade detection and persist on compromised systems.",
