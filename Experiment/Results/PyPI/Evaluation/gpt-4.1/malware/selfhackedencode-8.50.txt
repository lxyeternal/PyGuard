      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgn9t9zbu0qmv/ESQEule.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
