This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run potentially malicious software, which is characteristic of malware. Additionally, the code's use of hidden PowerShell execution and obfuscated commands strongly suggests malicious intent, as it aims to evade detection and execute arbitrary code without user consent.",
