It performs the following harmful activities:\n\n- Collects and exfiltrates Discord tokens, user account info, email, phone, badges, billing info, and friends list.\n- Extracts stored passwords and cookies from Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers.\n- Accesses and zips sensitive files from wallets (e.g., Exodus, Atomic Wallet), gaming platforms (Steam, Riot), and other applications.\n- Searches user directories for files containing keywords like 'password', 'account', 'wallet', 'crypto', etc., and uploads found files.\n- Uses webhooks to send all stolen data to a remote Discord webhook URL.\n- Downloads and uploads files to anonymous file hosting services.\n- Kills processes related to cryptocurrency wallets and browsers to prevent user interference.\n\nOverall, the script is designed to stealthily harvest a wide range of personal and financial information, then exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled server, making it highly malicious.",
