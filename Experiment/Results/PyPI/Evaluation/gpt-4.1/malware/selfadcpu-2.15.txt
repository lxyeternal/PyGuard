      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution. The PowerShell command is likely designed to download or execute malicious content from an external source, as indicated by the URL-like string embedded in the encoded command. Furthermore, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions suggests an attempt to suppress errors, which is typical in malicious scripts to avoid detection and debugging. Overall, these behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent, such as remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
