      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 that is executed silently using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag. This command is likely designed to perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads without user awareness. The obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as legitimate code typically does not include such hidden, encoded commands. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package named 'libcandyadhydra' with a seemingly benign description, which may be used as a cover for malicious operations or to avoid suspicion. Overall, the presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution indicates malicious behavior.",
