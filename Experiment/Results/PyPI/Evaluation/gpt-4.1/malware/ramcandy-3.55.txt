      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to run arbitrary, potentially harmful commands or payloads without user awareness. The code also suppresses errors silently, which can hide failures or detection attempts. Although the setup() function appears benign, the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, likely to download, install, or execute malicious payloads covertly.",
