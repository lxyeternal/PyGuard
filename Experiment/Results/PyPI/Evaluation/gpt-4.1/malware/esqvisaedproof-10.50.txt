      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection or repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with conditional checks indicates malicious intent, such as establishing persistence, downloading malware, or executing harmful scripts without user awareness.",
