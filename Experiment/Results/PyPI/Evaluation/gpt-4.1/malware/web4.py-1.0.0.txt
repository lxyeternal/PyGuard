      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process, executes decrypted code fetched from a Fernet-encrypted payload embedded within the script. Specifically, if the operating system is Windows ('nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string, and executes the resulting code via 'exec'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code during installation, which could be used to download additional payloads, establish backdoors, or perform other malicious activities. The obfuscation of the payload and the use of 'exec' to run decrypted code are classic indicators of malicious intent.",
