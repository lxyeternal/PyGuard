      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is likely designed to evade detection and could perform harmful actions on the system. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide errors and hinder analysis. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
