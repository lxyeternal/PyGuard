      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decodes and executes hidden code at runtime. Specifically, it stores an encrypted string (`wopvEaTEcopFEavc`) and a long numeric key (`iOpvEoeaaeavocp`). During execution, it performs an XOR decryption to reveal the actual code, which is then executed via `eval(compile(...))`. This pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to conceal their true intent, such as downloading, executing, or manipulating system resources without user consent. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and encrypted payload strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at evading detection and executing potentially harmful actions.",
