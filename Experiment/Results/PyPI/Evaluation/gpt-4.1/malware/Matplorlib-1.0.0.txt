      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This decrypted code is executed dynamically using `exec()`, which can lead to arbitrary and potentially harmful actions such as downloading, installing, or executing malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious intent designed to evade detection and perform unauthorized activities.",
