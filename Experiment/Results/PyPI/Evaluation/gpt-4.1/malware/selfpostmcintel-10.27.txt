      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to obfuscate and run malicious code without easy detection. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
