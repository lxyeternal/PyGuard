      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it attempts to import modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', and conditionally executes code that can install packages, create shortcuts, or manipulate files and system settings. The presence of code that interacts with system directories, environment variables, and Windows-specific APIs (e.g., 'win32com', 'ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin') indicates malicious behavior aimed at privilege escalation, persistence, or system compromise. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent to evade detection and perform harmful actions on the host system.",
