This behavior is indicative of malicious activity, as it involves unauthorized data exfiltration without user consent. The purpose appears to be to gather environment details potentially for tracking, fingerprinting, or further malicious actions. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious or at least suspicious code designed to spy on the user’s system.",
