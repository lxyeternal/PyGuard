      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious intent. It performs network requests to external URLs, including a call to 'https://dependabot.org/log/' with a parameter, which could be used for data exfiltration or tracking. More critically, it downloads a file from 'https://assets.dependabot.org/b510f7b23c35f6e2c198b9ae3f964b3c' and executes it directly via system calls, which is a classic method of executing malicious payloads. The code is embedded within a setup script, which is typically used for package installation, suggesting it could be used to infect systems during package installation or development setup. Overall, these behaviors—external data transmission, downloading and executing remote code—are characteristic of malicious activity, such as remote code execution or backdoor installation.",
