      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload embedded within the script. Specifically, it uses the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme to decrypt a payload and executes it dynamically via the exec() function. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code, as it allows the attacker to embed and run arbitrary malicious code during installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation of the payload and the conditional execution only on Windows further suggest malicious intent to target specific environments.",
