During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently run malicious code during package installation, which could lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggest malicious intent.",
