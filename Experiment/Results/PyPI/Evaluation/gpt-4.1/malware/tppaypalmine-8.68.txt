      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions, such as downloading and executing malware from an external server (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/szgn9zbub0qmv/ESQEule.exe'). Additionally, the code creates a setup script that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be used to disguise malicious intent. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and hidden subprocess execution strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system.",
