      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom post-installation command that executes 'python -m syntax' during the package installation process. The command 'syntax' is suspicious because it is not a standard Python module and appears to be a placeholder or obfuscated command. This behavior suggests an attempt to execute arbitrary or malicious code during installation, which could be used to run malicious scripts, download payloads, or compromise the system. Additionally, the package metadata contains misleading or nonsensical information (e.g., description 'Suicidate tahg') and the package name 'sylexnaranjoo' appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure, further indicating malicious intent or obfuscation. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior by executing arbitrary commands during installation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a Discord bot that contains multiple functionalities designed to compromise the victim's system and steal sensitive information. It includes commands to extract cookies from Chrome, retrieve Discord tokens from various browsers and applications, capture screenshots and webcam images, record system information, execute arbitrary shell commands, manipulate system windows, crash the system (via a BSOD), and even shut down the machine. Additionally, it can send the collected data to a remote Discord server, effectively turning the host into a malicious data exfiltration tool and remote control agent. The presence of commands like 'getcookies', 'tokens', 'shell', 'screenshot', 'webcampic', and 'bluescreen' strongly indicates malicious intent, as they facilitate data theft, system control, and denial-of-service actions.",
