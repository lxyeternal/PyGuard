      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given the obfuscation and use of hidden execution. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with setup operations, which may serve as a distraction or to mask malicious activities. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed in the background indicates malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious code without user awareness.",
