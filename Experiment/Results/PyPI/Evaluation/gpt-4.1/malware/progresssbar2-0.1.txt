      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded and obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses dynamic import statements, such as 'pip.main' and 'win32com', and manipulates environment variables and filesystem paths, potentially to install malicious packages, execute harmful scripts, or manipulate system files. The presence of code that creates shortcuts, accesses system directories, and conditionally executes code based on environment or admin status strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system, installing malware, or establishing persistence. The overall obfuscation and use of dynamic, runtime code execution techniques are typical of malicious scripts attempting to evade detection.",
