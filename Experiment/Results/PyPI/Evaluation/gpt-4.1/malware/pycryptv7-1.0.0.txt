It also captures screenshots, gathers system information, and exfiltrates all data to remote servers via webhooks and file uploads. Additionally, it searches for sensitive files on the user's system, uploads them to anonymous file hosting services, and attempts to disable security measures and processes associated with debugging or virtual machine detection. The code is designed to covertly extract personal, financial, and login credentials, and then exfiltrate this data to attackers, making it a comprehensive information-stealing malware.",
