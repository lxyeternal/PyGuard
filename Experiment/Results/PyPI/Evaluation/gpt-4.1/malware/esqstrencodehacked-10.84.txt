      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation combined with silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's overall structure and the presence of obfuscated commands point toward malicious behavior rather than legitimate software activity.",
