      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that downloads and executes a remote payload from an IP address (145.249.104.71). It attempts to fetch a file from the server, save it as '.drv' in the user's home directory, make it executable, and then run it. Additionally, it appends a command to the user's '.bashrc' file to execute this payload in future shell sessions. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, such as establishing persistence, executing arbitrary code, or creating a backdoor for remote control.",

It then sets the file as executable and appends a command to run this file in the user's '.bashrc' file, which will execute the malicious payload automatically upon user login or shell startup. This behavior indicates an attempt to establish persistence and execute potentially harmful code without user consent, characteristic of malware or remote backdoors.",
