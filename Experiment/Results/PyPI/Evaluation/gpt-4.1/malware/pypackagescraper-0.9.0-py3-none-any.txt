      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable ('neu2.exe') from an external URL, which could be used to run arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine. It also checks for Java installation, and if present, downloads a Java archive ('dcbot.jar') from another URL and copies it to the user's startup folder, then executes it. This behavior indicates an attempt to establish persistence and run malicious payloads, characteristic of malware or remote access trojans (RATs). The use of external URLs, silent downloads, and execution of downloaded files strongly suggest malicious intent.",
