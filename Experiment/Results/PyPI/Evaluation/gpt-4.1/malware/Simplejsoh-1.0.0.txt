      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes malicious code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This payload is executed via the 'exec' function, allowing arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the installer. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise.",
