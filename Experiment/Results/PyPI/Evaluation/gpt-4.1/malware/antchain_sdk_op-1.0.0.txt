It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves data exfiltration without user consent or awareness. The purpose appears to be to gather environment details potentially for tracking, fingerprinting, or further malicious actions. Such behavior is indicative of malicious intent, especially since it is embedded within a package setup process, which can be exploited to infect systems during package installation.",
