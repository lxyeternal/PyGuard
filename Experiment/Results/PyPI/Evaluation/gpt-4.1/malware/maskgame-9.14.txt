      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded, making it difficult to analyze directly, but such obfuscation is commonly used to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the payload, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious behavior, likely aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence.",
