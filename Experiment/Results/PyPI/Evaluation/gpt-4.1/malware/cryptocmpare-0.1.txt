      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears designed to hide malicious activities. It performs multiple dynamic imports, environment variable access, file operations (creating shortcuts, opening, saving, and deleting files), and directory manipulations—all within convoluted, encrypted-looking code. The use of dynamic string assembly, indirect function calls, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests an attempt to evade detection and execute malicious payloads such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or manipulating system files. The presence of code that interacts with system components (e.g., win32com, ctypes, os) and creates shortcuts or accesses environment variables indicates malicious intent to compromise the host system. Overall, this code is malicious and intended for harmful activities.",
