      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer (spyware) designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers, messaging apps, and other applications. It collects tokens, passwords, cookies, billing info, and files from various sources, including Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Discord, Steam, and Telegram. It then encrypts and uploads this data to external servers (e.g., gofile.io, anonfiles.com) without user consent. Additionally, it attempts to gather files from user directories based on specific keywords, zip them, and upload the archives. The code also retrieves the user's IP and geolocation info, and can potentially execute commands to kill processes, indicating control over the victim's environment. Overall, it functions as a comprehensive credential and data theft tool, characteristic of malware used for malicious espionage and credential harvesting.",
