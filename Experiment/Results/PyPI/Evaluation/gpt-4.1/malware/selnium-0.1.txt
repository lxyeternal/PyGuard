      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded and obfuscated expressions. Notably, it attempts to import modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', and conditionally executes code such as creating shortcuts, deleting files, or executing system commands based on obscure, hard-to-read conditions. The presence of code that interacts with system utilities, environment variables, and filesystem paths, combined with the obfuscation, strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing malicious packages, creating backdoors, or executing harmful payloads. The overall structure and tactics are typical of malware or malicious scripts aiming to evade detection and conceal their true purpose.",
