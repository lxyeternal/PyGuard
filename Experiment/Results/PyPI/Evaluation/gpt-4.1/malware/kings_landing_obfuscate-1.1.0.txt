      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to collect system information such as OS details, network configuration, and user information, then send this data to an external Slack webhook URL. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity, as it involves gathering sensitive data without user consent and exfiltrating it to an external server. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks related to its stated purpose, and the use of obfuscated or misleading variable names (e.g., 'kings_landing_obfuscate') further suggests malicious intent. Overall, this code appears to be a form of information stealer or backdoor component.",
