      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that, when executed, decodes and runs a base64-encoded script. This script appears to perform unauthorized actions such as creating objects, executing system commands, and potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads from external URLs. The obfuscation and use of dynamic code execution (via exec and base64 decoding) strongly suggest malicious intent, likely aiming to hide malicious activities like remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation. Overall, the code is designed to conceal malicious behavior and can compromise the security of the host system.",
