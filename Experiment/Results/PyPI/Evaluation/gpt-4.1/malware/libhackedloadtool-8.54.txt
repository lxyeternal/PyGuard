The base64-encoded string decodes to a PowerShell script that likely performs malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code attempts to install a package named 'libhackedloadtool' with a description suggesting it is a 'hacked' or malicious tool, which further indicates malicious intent. The use of obfuscation, hidden window execution, and the naming conventions all point toward malicious behavior designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions on the host system.",
