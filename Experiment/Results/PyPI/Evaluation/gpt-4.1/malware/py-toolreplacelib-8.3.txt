      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and may perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially without clear legitimate purpose, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to install a package named 'py-toolreplacelib' with a seemingly benign description, which could be a cover for malicious operations or a way to persist malicious code. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution and suspicious package installation strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
