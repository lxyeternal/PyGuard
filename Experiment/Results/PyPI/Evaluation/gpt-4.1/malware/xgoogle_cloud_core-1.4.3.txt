      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits typical characteristics of a data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication mechanism. It collects system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, encodes this data, and then transmits it covertly via DNS queries (using 'ping' commands with specially crafted domain names) and HTTP requests to external domains. The data is obfuscated through base64 encoding and hex encoding, making detection more difficult. The use of DNS queries to encode and send data is a common technique in malware to bypass network monitoring, and the multiple HTTP requests further suggest attempts to exfiltrate data or receive commands. Overall, these behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent, such as establishing a covert channel for data theft or remote control.",
