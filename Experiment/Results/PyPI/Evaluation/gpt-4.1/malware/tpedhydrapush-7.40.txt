      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the PowerShell command. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently and without visible windows, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at evading detection. The presence of such obfuscated code and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
