      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. The decoded payload is highly obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious intent. Such behavior suggests an attempt to conceal malicious actions, such as executing harmful commands, establishing backdoors, or downloading/executing additional malware. The use of `exec()` on decoded data is a significant red flag, indicating that the code is designed to run hidden or malicious code without easy inspection. Overall, this code is malicious, likely intended for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or malware deployment.",
