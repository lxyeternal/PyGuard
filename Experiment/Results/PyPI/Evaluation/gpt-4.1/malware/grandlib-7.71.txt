      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is a common technique for executing obfuscated or malicious scripts. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malware, without user awareness. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common tactic used in malware delivery and persistence mechanisms.",
