      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious payloads or activities. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL in the base64-encoded string). Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which can be a tactic to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks strongly suggests malicious intent, such as malware download, remote code execution, or persistence mechanisms.",
