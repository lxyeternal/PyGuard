      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and may perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially executed without user awareness, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. Overall, the code exhibits typical traits of malware, including obfuscation, stealthy execution, and potential remote control capabilities.",
