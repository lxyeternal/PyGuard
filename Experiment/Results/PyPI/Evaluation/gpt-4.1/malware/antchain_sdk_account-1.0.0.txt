It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves data exfiltration without user consent or awareness. The purpose appears to be to gather environment details for further malicious actions or reconnaissance, which is a common tactic in malware or malicious campaigns.",
