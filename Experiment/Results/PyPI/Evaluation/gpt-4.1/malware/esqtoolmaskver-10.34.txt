      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or download/execute further payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or part of the malicious activity. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the context indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or payload delivery.",
