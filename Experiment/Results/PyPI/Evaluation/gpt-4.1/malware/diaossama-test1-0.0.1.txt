It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://162.62.15.24/v/). This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks related to the package, suggesting its primary purpose is to gather and transmit potentially sensitive system information without user consent, which is malicious.",
