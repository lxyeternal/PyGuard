      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to covertly clone malicious repositories into the user's startup folder, effectively establishing persistence on the victim's machine. It clones repositories containing potentially harmful scripts or executables and moves a script to the startup directory, ensuring it runs automatically upon system boot. Additionally, it executes a downloaded executable, which could be malicious payload. These behaviors are characteristic of malware aiming to maintain persistence, execute malicious code at startup, and potentially compromise the system's security.",
