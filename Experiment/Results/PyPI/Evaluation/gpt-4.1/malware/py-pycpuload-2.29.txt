      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. This behavior indicates an attempt to perform potentially harmful actions such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence, which are common tactics in malware. The presence of such obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious intent, especially given the context and obfuscation techniques used.",
