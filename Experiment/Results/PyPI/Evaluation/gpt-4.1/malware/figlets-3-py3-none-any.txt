It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive and exfiltrates them to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot via the Telegram Bot API. Additionally, it gathers the victim's IP address and geolocation information to include in the message. This behavior indicates malicious intent, aiming to steal private wallet information and send it to an attacker without user consent or awareness.",
