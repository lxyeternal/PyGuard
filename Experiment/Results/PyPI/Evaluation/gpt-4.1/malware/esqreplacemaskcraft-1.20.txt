      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This command could download or execute malicious content from an external source, potentially compromising the system. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing harmful commands.",
