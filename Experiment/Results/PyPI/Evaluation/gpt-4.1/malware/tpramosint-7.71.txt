      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or activity, such as downloading or executing malicious files, establishing backdoors, or other harmful actions. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The presence of such obfuscated and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to conceal malicious operations and avoid detection.",
