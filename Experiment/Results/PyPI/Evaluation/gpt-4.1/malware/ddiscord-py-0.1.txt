      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic, including the use of meaningless variable names, extensive use of bitwise operations, and dynamic code execution techniques such as 'pip.main()' and 'os.system()' calls with dynamically constructed strings. It also manipulates system files, environment variables, and attempts to create shortcuts or access system privileges (e.g., 'ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin()'). The presence of these behaviors, combined with the obfuscation, strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing or executing malicious payloads, bypassing security checks, or compromising system integrity.",
