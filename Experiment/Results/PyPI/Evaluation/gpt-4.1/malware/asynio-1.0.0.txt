      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via Fernet encryption. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to hide malicious activities from casual inspection and target Windows users specifically.",
