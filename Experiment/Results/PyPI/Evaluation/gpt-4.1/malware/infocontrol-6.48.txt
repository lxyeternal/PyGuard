      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package distribution. The use of hidden process creation and obfuscated commands indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms.",
