It performs activities such as stealing browser passwords, cookies, history, credit card details, and Discord tokens. It also captures screenshots, gathers system info, and collects network data, then compresses and exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks and anonymous file hosting services. Additionally, it attempts to disable security measures, kill security-related processes, and persist on startup, all typical behaviors of malware aimed at espionage, credential theft, and system compromise.",
