      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgn9t9zbu0qmv/Esqeule.exe'), potentially installing malware or performing unauthorized actions on the victim's system. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and external URL downloads strongly suggests malicious intent.",
