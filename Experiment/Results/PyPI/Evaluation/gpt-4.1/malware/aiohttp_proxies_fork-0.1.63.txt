      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and heavily encoded payloads that, when decoded and executed, perform malicious activities such as establishing unauthorized remote connections, executing arbitrary commands, and potentially creating backdoors or remote shells. It installs various system and network-related Python packages, likely to facilitate network communication or control. The embedded base64-encoded scripts include functions for remote command execution, file manipulation, and network communication, indicating intent to control or compromise the host system remotely. Overall, the code is designed to covertly set up a backdoor, execute malicious commands, and maintain persistent access, which classifies it as malicious behavior.",
