      "malicious_behavior": "The code functions as a token grabber targeting Discord user tokens stored in various browser profiles and applications. It extracts Discord tokens from local storage files, decrypts them, and then uses these tokens to access the victim's Discord account information via Discord's API. The script collects sensitive data such as email, phone number, MFA status, Nitro subscription details, IP address, PC username, and computer name. It then constructs a detailed report containing this information and sends it to a specified Discord webhook. This behavior is characteristic of malicious credential theft and data exfiltration, commonly associated with malware or malicious scripts designed to compromise user accounts and privacy.",
