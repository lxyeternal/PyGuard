      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely designed to perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing unauthorized connections, or other malicious activities. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a hidden window and the obfuscated command strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious behavior aimed at evading detection.",
