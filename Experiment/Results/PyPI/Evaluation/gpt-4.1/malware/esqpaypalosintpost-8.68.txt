      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The command is encoded in Base64, and its purpose is likely to run malicious code silently in the background. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a method to avoid repeated execution or detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common tactic used in malware to evade detection and perform harmful actions without user awareness.",
