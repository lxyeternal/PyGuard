      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear intentionally designed to conceal malicious behavior. It performs dynamic imports, creates shortcuts, manipulates environment variables, and interacts with system files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor activity. The use of obscure variable names, extensive bitwise operations, and dynamic code execution suggests an attempt to evade detection and hide malicious intent. Specifically, it appears to be installing or executing payloads, possibly with administrative privileges, and manipulating system resources or files covertly. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious scripts aimed at unauthorized system access, persistence, or data exfiltration.",
