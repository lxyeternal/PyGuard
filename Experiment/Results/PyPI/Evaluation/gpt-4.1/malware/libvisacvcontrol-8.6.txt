      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. This behavior suggests the code is designed to perform malicious activities such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence of malicious payloads. Additionally, the code proceeds to call 'setup' for a package named 'libvisacvcontrol' with seemingly legitimate metadata, which could be used as a decoy or to blend malicious activity within legitimate package installation processes. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the silent execution context indicates malicious intent.",
