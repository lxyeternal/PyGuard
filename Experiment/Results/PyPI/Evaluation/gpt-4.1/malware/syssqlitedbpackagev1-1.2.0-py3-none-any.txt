      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors: \n\n1. **Installation of numerous packages**: It installs a wide array of potentially unnecessary or suspicious modules, which could be used for malicious purposes.\n\n2. **Cryptodome and Crypto directory copying**: It copies the 'Cryptodome' directory over the 'Crypto' directory within Python site-packages, potentially to replace or hijack cryptographic libraries, indicating an attempt to manipulate or intercept cryptographic operations.\n\n3. **Decrypted and executed embedded payload**: It decrypts a large encrypted string using Fernet, then executes the decrypted code via `exec()`. This payload likely contains malicious code, such as backdoors, keyloggers, or further malware, which is hidden until runtime.\n\n4. **Persistence mechanisms**: It writes a script (`pl.py`) to the user's AppData directory and launches it in a new process, ensuring the malicious payload runs persistently.\n\n5. **Download and persistence of a remote script**: It downloads a script (`run.py`) from a suspicious URL (`https://kekwltd.ru/run.py`) into the Windows Startup folder, then sets it as hidden. This ensures the script executes on system startup, maintaining persistence.\n\n6. **Attempted execution of the downloaded script**: It tries to run the downloaded script from the Startup folder, further embedding malicious activity that persists across reboots.\n\n**Overall**, the code is clearly designed for malicious purposes, including executing hidden payloads, establishing persistence, and potentially intercepting cryptographic operations or stealing data. Therefore, it is classified as malicious.",
