      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and runs with hidden window style, indicating an intent to operate covertly. The presence of this obfuscated command suggests malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful actions. Additionally, the code's attempt to set up a package named 'tploadsplithacked' with suspicious metadata further indicates malicious intent, possibly to disguise or distribute malicious modules. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malware, including obfuscated command execution and suspicious package setup.",
