      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor behavior. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, environment variable access, and system-level operations (like creating shortcuts and checking admin privileges) strongly suggests malicious intent. The code's primary purpose seems to be covertly executing or installing malicious payloads, possibly with privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms, which could harm the system or compromise security.",
