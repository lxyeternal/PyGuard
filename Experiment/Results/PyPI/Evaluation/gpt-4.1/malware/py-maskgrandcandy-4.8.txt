      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment referencing a suspicious URL ('//dl.dropbx.com/s/zgnyt9zubu0qmv/EsqUele.exe'). This behavior is characteristic of malware trying to silently download and run malicious software. Additionally, the code's obfuscation and the use of hidden window flags suggest an intent to conceal malicious activity. The setup function appears benign but is likely used to disguise or facilitate the malicious payload execution.",
