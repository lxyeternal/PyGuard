      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as executing obfuscated or malicious scripts. The encoded command is likely designed to hide its true intent, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can be used to hide errors and avoid detection. While the setup() function appears benign, the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution or malware delivery.",
