      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the host system, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise malicious activity under the guise of a benign setup script, which is a common tactic in malicious Python scripts. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
