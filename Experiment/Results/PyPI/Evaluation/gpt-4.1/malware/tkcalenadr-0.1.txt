      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded and obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses dynamic import statements, such as 'pip.main' and 'win32com', and manipulates environment variables and filesystem paths, potentially to install malicious packages, execute harmful scripts, or manipulate system files. The presence of code that creates shortcuts, accesses system directories, and uses dynamic code execution techniques strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system, installing malware, or exfiltrating data. The obfuscation and use of dynamic imports are typical tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection and analysis.",
