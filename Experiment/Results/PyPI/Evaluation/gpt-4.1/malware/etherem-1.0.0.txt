      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process, executes a decryption routine using Fernet with a hardcoded key and encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via `exec()`. The use of encrypted code, dynamic execution, and the obfuscation of behavior strongly suggest malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or installing malware. Additionally, the code's obfuscated variable names and encrypted payload indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity from casual inspection.",
