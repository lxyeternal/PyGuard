This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and may perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized connections, or executing other malicious scripts. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially without clear legitimate purpose, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window), further suggesting malicious behavior aimed at covert operation.",
