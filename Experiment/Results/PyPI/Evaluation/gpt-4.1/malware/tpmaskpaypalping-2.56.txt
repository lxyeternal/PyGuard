      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload, when decoded, likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads without user awareness. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' indicates an attempt to run malicious code stealthily. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to execute this hidden command, which is a common tactic in malware or backdoor scripts. The rest of the code, including the setup function, seems to be a decoy or distraction, but the core behavior is malicious.",
