      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. This behavior suggests the code is designed to perform malicious actions such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence of malicious payloads. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to run hidden PowerShell commands, which is a typical tactic used in malware to evade detection and maintain stealth. The presence of such obfuscated command execution classifies this code as malicious.",
