      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded expressions. Notably, it uses the 'pip.main()' function to install packages, which is deprecated and potentially dangerous, and it manipulates system environment variables and filesystem paths. Additionally, it attempts to create shortcuts and save files in locations determined by dynamically generated paths, which could be used to execute or drop malicious payloads. The overall obfuscation, use of dynamic imports, environment variable access, and file operations strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at covertly installing or executing malicious code, possibly with privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.",
