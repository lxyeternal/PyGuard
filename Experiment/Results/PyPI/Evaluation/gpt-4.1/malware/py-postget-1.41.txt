This behavior indicates an attempt to run potentially malicious payloads silently on the host system. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise malicious activity under the guise of a benign setup script, which is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The presence of obfuscated commands and external downloads strongly suggests malicious intent.",
