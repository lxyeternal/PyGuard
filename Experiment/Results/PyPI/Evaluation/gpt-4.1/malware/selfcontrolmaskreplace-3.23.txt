      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads or activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, suggesting an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution, especially in conjunction with a conditional check, indicates malicious intent, likely to download, execute, or perform other malicious activities covertly.",
