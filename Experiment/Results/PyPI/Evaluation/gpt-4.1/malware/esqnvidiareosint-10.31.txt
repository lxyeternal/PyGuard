      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command string. Additionally, the code attempts to run a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious activities, such as installing malicious packages or establishing persistence. The use of try-except blocks to suppress errors further suggests an attempt to hide malicious actions. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malware, including obfuscated command execution and concealment tactics.",
