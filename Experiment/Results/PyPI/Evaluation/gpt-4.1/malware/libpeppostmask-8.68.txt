      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated nature of the command. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which suggests persistence or anti-analysis techniques. The use of hidden window style, no window creation, and obfuscated commands are common tactics in malware to evade detection and execute malicious activities silently.",
