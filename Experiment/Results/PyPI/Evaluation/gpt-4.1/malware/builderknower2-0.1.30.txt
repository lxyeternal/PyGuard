      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation script that, during package installation, executes multiple system commands to fetch and execute remote content from external URLs, including a PEM file and potentially other scripts. It also installs the 'requests' library if not present. The script constructs and runs Python commands via os.system() to perform HTTP GET requests to external servers, some with custom headers and proxy settings, and appends the responses to a file named 'LICENSE'. Additionally, it creates a temporary file '/tmp/pytest2'. These behaviors suggest an attempt to exfiltrate data, download and execute malicious payloads, or establish unauthorized communication channels, which are characteristic of malicious activity.",
