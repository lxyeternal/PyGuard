      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing remote payloads, establishing persistence, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which can be a tactic to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated and hidden execution patterns strongly indicates malicious intent, as legitimate setup scripts typically do not include hidden PowerShell commands or conditional checks for specific files to trigger malicious behavior.",
