      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains embedded payloads that attempt to establish persistence and execute malicious scripts on the host system. Specifically, on Windows, it writes a script to the startup folder to ensure execution at login, installs a Python package via pip (which could be used to download or run malicious modules), and creates a VBE (Visual Basic Script) file in the startup directory to execute further malicious code. On Linux, it downloads and executes a remote script via wget, which could be used to install malware or backdoors. These behaviors aim to persistently compromise the system, potentially allowing remote control, data theft, or further malware deployment. The code also obfuscates its intent with complex color and animation functions, likely to mask its malicious activities.",
