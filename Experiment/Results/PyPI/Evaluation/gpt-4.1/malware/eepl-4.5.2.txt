      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom installation command. During the installation process, it attempts to retrieve the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and send it via an HTTP GET request to an external server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation <COMPUTERNAME>'). Additionally, it downloads and executes an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') from a suspicious URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') using 'os.system'. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system information and execute potentially harmful code on the victim's machine, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
