      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded payload that, when executed, performs network requests to a specified URL (http://20.226.18.203/grab/ry2K1CVRSFa59vT) and attempts to execute the retrieved content as Python code. This behavior indicates an attempt to fetch and run remote malicious scripts, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or further malware installation. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it aims to hide the true purpose of the code from casual inspection.",
