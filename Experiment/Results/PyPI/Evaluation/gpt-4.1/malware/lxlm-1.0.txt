This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it can be used to deliver malicious payloads, such as trojans, ransomware, or backdoors, onto the victim's machine. The use of 'os.system' to start the downloaded file further indicates an intent to execute potentially harmful code without user consent or awareness. Overall, this code exhibits malicious behavior by actively retrieving and executing external malicious content.",
