      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class `GruppeInstall` that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via the `exec()` function. This code is encrypted with Fernet symmetric encryption, indicating an attempt to obfuscate malicious payloads. The use of `exec()` to run decrypted code, combined with the presence of encrypted payloads and conditional execution only on Windows, strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, malware, or other harmful components without user consent.",
