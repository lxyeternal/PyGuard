This behavior is suspicious because it collects and transmits potentially sensitive system information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or reconnaissance. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or configuration tasks that justify this behavior, indicating that its primary purpose is likely malicious.",
