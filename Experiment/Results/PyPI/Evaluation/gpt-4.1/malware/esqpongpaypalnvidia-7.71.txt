      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/szgnyt9zubu0qmv/ESQEule.exe'), potentially installing malware or performing unauthorized actions on the victim's system. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions suggests an attempt to conceal or suppress errors, which is typical in malicious scripts to avoid detection or debugging. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
