      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious payloads or activities. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL in the base64-encoded string). Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious actions. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the presence of a seemingly benign setup function suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation.",
