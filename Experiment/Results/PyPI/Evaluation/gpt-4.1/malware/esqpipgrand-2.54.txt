      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which may serve as a decoy or to facilitate malicious distribution. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the silent, hidden execution context indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware download.",
