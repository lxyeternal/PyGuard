      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. The PowerShell command is encoded in base64 and is likely intended to download or execute malicious payloads from external sources. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, malware download, or other harmful activities.",
