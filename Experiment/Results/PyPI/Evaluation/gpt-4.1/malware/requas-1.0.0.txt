      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows suggests an intent to hide malicious activities and target specific environments, making this code malicious.",
