      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious software or scripts. Additionally, the code's attempt to run this command without any validation or user consent further indicates malicious behavior. The setup function appears benign and may be used to disguise or distract from the malicious activity, but the core concern is the obfuscated PowerShell command execution.",
