      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or compromising the system. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' indicates an attempt to run hidden, obfuscated malicious code without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be covert execution rather than legitimate setup or package installation, which is suspicious behavior. Overall, this code exhibits typical traits of malware or malicious scripts designed to compromise the host system.",
