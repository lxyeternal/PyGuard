      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then runs the PowerShell command, which suggests an anti-analysis or anti-sandboxing technique. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks indicates malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious code without user awareness.",
