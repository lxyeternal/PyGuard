      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. This behavior suggests an attempt to download, execute, or perform other malicious actions covertly. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks to suppress errors and the presence of obfuscated commands are common tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection and maintain persistence. The inclusion of a seemingly legitimate setup function appears to be a decoy or a means to blend malicious activity with legitimate package setup, further indicating malicious intent.",
