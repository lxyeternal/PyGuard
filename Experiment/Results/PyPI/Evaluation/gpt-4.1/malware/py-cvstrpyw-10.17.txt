      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing harmful payloads. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, which may serve as a decoy or to blend malicious activity with legitimate package installation. Overall, the presence of hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands indicates malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious operations covertly.",
