      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is executed with a hidden window. This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts that aim to run hidden or obfuscated commands, potentially for malicious purposes such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing persistence. The use of encoded commands and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious intent, especially since the payload is obfuscated and not directly readable. Additionally, the code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation activities related to the 'httpram' package, indicating that the setup block may be a cover or a means to mask malicious activity. Overall, this code exhibits typical traits of malicious scripts designed to evade detection and execute harmful payloads silently.",
