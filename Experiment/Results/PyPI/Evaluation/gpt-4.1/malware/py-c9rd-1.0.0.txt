      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the 'install' command during setup. During installation on Windows systems ('os.name' == 'nt'), it decrypts and executes a Fernet-encrypted payload using the 'exec' function. This behavior indicates the code is designed to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code during installation, which can lead to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. The use of encrypted payloads and execution during setup strongly suggests malicious intent, as it can be used to hide malicious payloads from static analysis and execute malicious code without user awareness.",
