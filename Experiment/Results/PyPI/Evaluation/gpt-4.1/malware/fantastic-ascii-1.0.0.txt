      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a post-installation routine (_post_install) that executes during the package installation process. This routine performs several suspicious actions: it appends a message to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt', retrieves the attacker's external IP address, encodes system and network information (IP, hostname, installation path) into a base64 string, and then sends this encoded data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (kotko.org). This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system and network information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code's primary purpose appears to be to secretly gather and transmit system details to an external server, potentially for malicious tracking or control purposes.",
