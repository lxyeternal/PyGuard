      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within the custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload, which is likely malicious. This behavior allows remote code execution without user awareness, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activities. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads are typical indicators of malicious intent.",
