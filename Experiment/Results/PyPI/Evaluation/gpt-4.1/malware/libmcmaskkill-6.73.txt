      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download, execute, or perform other malicious activities without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only runs the malicious PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or prevent repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
