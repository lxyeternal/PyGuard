      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized connections, or executing other malicious scripts. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially without clear legitimate purpose, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window), which is a common tactic used by malware to avoid user detection. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the embedded PowerShell command is a significant red flag for malicious behavior.",
