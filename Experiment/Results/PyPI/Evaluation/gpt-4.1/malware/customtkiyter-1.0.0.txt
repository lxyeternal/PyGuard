      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code fetched from an encrypted payload. Specifically, it uses the Fernet encryption scheme to decrypt a payload and then executes it via `exec()`. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code during package installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to execute malicious payloads stealthily. The presence of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it aims to hide the true nature of the code and execute arbitrary code without user awareness.",
