      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload, when decoded, likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads without user awareness. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a long, obfuscated string is a common technique to conceal malicious activity. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window, no window), further indicating malicious intent. The rest of the script appears to be benign setup code, but the presence of this hidden PowerShell execution classifies the overall script as malicious due to its potential to perform harmful operations covertly.",
