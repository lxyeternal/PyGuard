      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command string. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently and without visible windows, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence or executing malicious actions covertly. The presence of such obfuscated code and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
