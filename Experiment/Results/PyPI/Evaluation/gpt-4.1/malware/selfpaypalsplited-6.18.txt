      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially executed without user awareness, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command only if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, which may be a tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. Overall, this behavior suggests the code is designed to perform malicious actions covertly.",
