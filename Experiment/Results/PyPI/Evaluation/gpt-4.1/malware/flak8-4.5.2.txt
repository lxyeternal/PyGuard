Additionally, it sends an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL (`https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw <COMPUTERNAME>`) with the environment variable `COMPUTERNAME`. This behavior indicates an attempt to download and execute potentially malicious payloads, as well as exfiltrate system information, which are common tactics in malware distribution and remote control. The code is designed to run during the package installation process, making it highly malicious.",
