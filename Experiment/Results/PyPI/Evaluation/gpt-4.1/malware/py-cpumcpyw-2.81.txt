The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized actions on the system, which is characteristic of malicious activity. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to download or execute further malicious payloads, making it malicious.",
