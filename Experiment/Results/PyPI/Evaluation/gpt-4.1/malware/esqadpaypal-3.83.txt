      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with hidden window flags, indicating an intent to run malicious or unauthorized code silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or executing other harmful actions.",
