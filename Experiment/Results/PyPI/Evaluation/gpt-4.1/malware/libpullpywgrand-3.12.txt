      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, which can compromise the system. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, making detection and debugging difficult. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and conditional behavior based on file existence strongly indicates malicious intent.",
