      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.dropbx.com/s/zgnyt9zbuB0qmv/EsqUeLe.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly legitimate Python package setup, which may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious intent. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and hidden subprocess execution strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the host system.",
