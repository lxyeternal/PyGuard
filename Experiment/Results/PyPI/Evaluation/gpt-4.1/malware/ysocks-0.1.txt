      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears intentionally designed to conceal its true purpose. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules such as 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', which are often used in malicious scripts for package management, Windows COM automation, and low-level system access respectively. The code also constructs and executes system commands, manipulates files, and creates shortcuts, potentially to install or execute malicious payloads, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data. The extensive use of obfuscation, dynamic attribute access, and convoluted calculations strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at evading detection and analysis. Overall, this code is malicious and could harm the system or compromise security.",
