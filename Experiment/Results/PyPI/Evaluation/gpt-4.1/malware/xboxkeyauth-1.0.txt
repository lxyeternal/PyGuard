It then attempts to execute this temporary script by launching a new process with the system's executable, appending 'w.exe' to its name. This behavior indicates an attempt to run potentially malicious remote code without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, malware download, or backdoor installation.",

It then launches a new process running the current Python executable with the temporary file as an argument, effectively executing the malicious payload in a separate process. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code fetched from the internet, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, malware distribution, or backdoor installation.",
