      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within the custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme. This behavior suggests the code is designed to silently run malicious payloads during setup, potentially allowing remote code execution, data theft, or other harmful activities without user awareness. The obfuscation of strings and the use of encrypted payloads are common tactics to evade detection and facilitate malicious operations.",
