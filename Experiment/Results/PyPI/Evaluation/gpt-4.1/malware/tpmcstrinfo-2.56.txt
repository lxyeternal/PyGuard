      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment referencing a suspicious URL ('//dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zubu0qmv/ESQUELE.EXE'). Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious activity. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution and external URL references strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at downloading or executing harmful payloads.",
