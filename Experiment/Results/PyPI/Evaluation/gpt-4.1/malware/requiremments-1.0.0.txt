      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from a Fernet-encrypted payload embedded within the script. This behavior allows remote code execution, enabling an attacker to run arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine. The obfuscation of variable names, the use of encrypted payloads, and the conditional execution only on Windows are typical indicators of malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to surreptitiously compromise the system during setup, making it malicious.",
