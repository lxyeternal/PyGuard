      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or commands that could compromise the system, such as downloading or executing malicious files. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a seemingly legitimate Python package, which may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent subprocess invocation indicates malicious intent to evade detection and execute harmful actions on the host system.",
