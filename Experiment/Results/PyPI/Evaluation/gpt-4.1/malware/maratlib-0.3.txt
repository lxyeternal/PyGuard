      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a direct call to download and execute a remote script via a system command: `wget ... && chmod 777 ... && bash ...`. This behavior indicates an attempt to fetch and run potentially malicious code from an external source, which can lead to remote code execution, malware installation, or system compromise. The obfuscated function appears to be a decoding routine, likely used to conceal malicious payloads or strings, but the critical malicious activity is the remote script download and execution, which is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
