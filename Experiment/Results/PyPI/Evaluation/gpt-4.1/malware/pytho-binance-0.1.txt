      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded and obfuscated expressions. Notably, it attempts to import 'pip' and install or modify packages, and later uses 'win32com' and 'Dispatch' to potentially execute system-level operations, such as creating shortcuts, accessing environment variables, and manipulating files or system components. The presence of such obfuscated code, combined with the use of system-specific modules and dynamic execution, strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing harmful actions, such as installing malicious packages, creating shortcuts, or executing arbitrary code. The code's structure and obfuscation are typical of malware or backdoor scripts attempting to evade detection.",
