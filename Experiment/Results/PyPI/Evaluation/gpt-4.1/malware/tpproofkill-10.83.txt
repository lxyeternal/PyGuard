      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or payloads silently on the target system. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, indicating an attempt to evade detection or control execution flow. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional behavior strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities.",
