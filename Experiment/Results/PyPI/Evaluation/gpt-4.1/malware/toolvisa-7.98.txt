The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payload, such as downloading or executing malicious files, establishing reverse shells, or other harmful activities. This behavior indicates an attempt to run hidden, potentially harmful code on the host system, which is characteristic of malicious intent. Additionally, the code silently ignores errors, further obscuring malicious actions and making detection more difficult.",
