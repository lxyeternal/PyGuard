      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given its obfuscated nature. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious intent or establish persistence. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and hidden execution strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing malicious code without user awareness.",
