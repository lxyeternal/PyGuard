      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from a remote server (as indicated by the URL in the command). Additionally, the code silently suppresses errors, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing arbitrary commands on the host system.",
