      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious payload designed to run arbitrary code or download/execute malicious content without user awareness. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common technique used in malware to evade detection and perform malicious actions covertly.",
