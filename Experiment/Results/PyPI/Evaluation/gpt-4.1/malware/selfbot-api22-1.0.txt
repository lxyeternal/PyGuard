      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding (base64, base16, base32, base85) and marshaling, which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads. The core behavior involves decoding, decompressing, and executing a large amount of embedded data, which is likely to be malicious code or payloads. The numerous long strings of encoded data suggest an attempt to conceal malicious scripts, such as malware, backdoors, or remote access tools. The presence of variable names like '__kys_skid__' and the pattern of repeated, large, encoded strings strongly indicate this is a 'skid' (malicious loader or downloader) script designed to evade detection and execute malicious payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious, primarily acting as a loader for malicious payloads, which could compromise the infected system or perform unauthorized actions.",
