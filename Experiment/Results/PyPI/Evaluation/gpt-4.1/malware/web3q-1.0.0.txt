      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes malicious code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior allows remote code execution, potentially enabling attackers to run arbitrary commands, steal data, or compromise the system. The obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows are typical indicators of malicious intent designed to evade detection and establish unauthorized access.",
