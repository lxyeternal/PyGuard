      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or commands that could compromise the system, such as downloading or executing malicious files, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which can be a tactic to evade detection or re-infection. The presence of such obfuscated and hidden execution behavior strongly indicates malicious intent.",
