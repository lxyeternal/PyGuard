      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious code. This behavior suggests an attempt to run potentially harmful scripts or payloads silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, indicating an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, such as installing malware, establishing backdoors, or downloading additional malicious payloads.",
