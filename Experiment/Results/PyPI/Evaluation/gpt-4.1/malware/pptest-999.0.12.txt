      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and communicating with external DNS servers covertly. It gathers sensitive data such as the hostname, current working directory, local IP addresses, and the public WAN IP address, then encodes this information into a payload. The payload is transformed into a hexadecimal string and transmitted via DNS A record queries to a specified domain (burpcollaborator.net), which is commonly used for command-and-control or data exfiltration in malicious activities. Additionally, the code includes a function that appears to be a security test message but is likely a decoy or a cover for the real malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect and transmit system information to an external server, which is characteristic of malware or spyware.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a covert data exfiltration mechanism using DNS queries. It constructs a payload containing system information such as hostname, current working directory, WAN IP address, and local IP addresses. This payload is then hashed and encoded into a hexadecimal string, which is segmented and sent as DNS A record queries to a domain controlled by an attacker (fake_domain: 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net'). This technique allows an attacker to stealthily collect sensitive system information without raising suspicion, leveraging DNS traffic for data exfiltration. The presence of such behavior, especially the encoding and transmission of system details via DNS queries to a controlled domain, indicates malicious intent.",
