      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run covertly. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious software without user awareness. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command is a significant red flag indicating malicious behavior.",
