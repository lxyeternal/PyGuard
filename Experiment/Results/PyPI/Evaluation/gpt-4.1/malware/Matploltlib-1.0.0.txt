      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched from a hardcoded Fernet-encrypted string. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code silently, which is a common tactic in malware to execute malicious actions such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or further downloading malicious payloads. The use of encryption and obfuscation suggests an intent to evade detection and conceal malicious intent.",
