It performs extensive data theft activities, including stealing cookies, passwords, browser history, credit card information, and Discord tokens from the victim's machine. It also captures screenshots, gathers system information, and exfiltrates all collected data to remote servers via webhooks and file uploads. Additionally, it can terminate security or analysis processes, disable certain protections, and persist by copying itself to startup folders. The code is designed to covertly extract sensitive user data, monitor activity, and facilitate unauthorized access or financial theft, indicating clear malicious intent.",
