      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks around the obfuscated command and setup function may be to suppress errors and hide malicious activity. Overall, this code exhibits typical characteristics of malicious scripts designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful operations.",
