      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet encryption. This payload is likely malicious, as it is hidden within the code and only executed conditionally on the OS. The use of encrypted code execution, especially within a setup script, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity, such as downloading or executing harmful code, which can compromise the system. Overall, this behavior is characteristic of malicious intent.",
