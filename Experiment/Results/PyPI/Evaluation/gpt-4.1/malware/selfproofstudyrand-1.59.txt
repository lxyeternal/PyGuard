      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is likely obfuscated to evade detection. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide failures or malicious actions. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as legitimate scripts rarely use such techniques without clear purpose. Overall, this code exhibits behavior characteristic of malware or malicious scripts designed to compromise or control the system.",
