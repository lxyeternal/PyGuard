      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon package installation, executes an arbitrary subprocess command: 'sys.executable -m poc_nvk.my_module'. This behavior suggests that malicious code could be embedded within the 'poc_nvk.my_module' module, which is run automatically during installation without user consent. Such behavior can be used to execute malicious scripts, download additional payloads, or compromise the system. The use of a custom install step to run arbitrary code indicates malicious intent, especially if the module contains harmful code or is used to establish persistence or perform unauthorized actions.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information such as hostname, operating system name, and IP address, then sends this data to an external server controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates potential malicious activity, as it could be used for reconnaissance, tracking, or further exploitation without user consent. The code does not perform any legitimate or transparent function and appears designed to exfiltrate sensitive system details surreptitiously.",
