      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other malicious actions. The encoded command is hidden and obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, which is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful or legitimate setup tasks; instead, it silently runs potentially harmful code in the background. This behavior suggests the script is designed to compromise the system or perform malicious operations without user consent.",
