      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears intentionally designed to hide its true purpose. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules like 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', which are often used for system-level operations or privilege escalation. The code also manipulates environment variables, creates shortcuts, and interacts with the filesystem in a manner consistent with malware or malicious scripts aiming to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or execute payloads covertly. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic attribute access, and convoluted calculations strongly suggests malicious intent, likely to evade detection and analysis.",
