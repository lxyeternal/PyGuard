It then compresses these files into a ZIP archive and exfiltrates them via Telegram's Bot API, effectively stealing private wallet data and transmitting it to an attacker-controlled channel. This behavior constitutes theft of sensitive information and unauthorized data exfiltration, classifying the code as malicious.",
