This behavior indicates an attempt to fetch and run remote malicious code, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The presence of such obfuscated code and remote code execution mechanisms classifies this as malicious activity.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from an external URL and then executes it without any validation or user consent. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to deliver malware, ransomware, or other harmful payloads onto the victim's system. Running an external executable directly poses significant security risks, especially when the source is untrusted, making this code highly suspicious and malicious.",
