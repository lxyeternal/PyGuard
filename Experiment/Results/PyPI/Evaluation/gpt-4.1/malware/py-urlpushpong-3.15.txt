      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to download or execute remote content covertly, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The presence of such obfuscated command execution indicates malicious intent, despite the seemingly benign setup() call.",
