      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a base64-encoded payload strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing a backdoor. Overall, these behaviors indicate the script is malicious.",
