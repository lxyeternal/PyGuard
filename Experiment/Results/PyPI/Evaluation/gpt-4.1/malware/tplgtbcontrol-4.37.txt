      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently, bypassing user detection. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which may serve as a cover for malicious activity or to appear legitimate. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the silent execution flags indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation.",
