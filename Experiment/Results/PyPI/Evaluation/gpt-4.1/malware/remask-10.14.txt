      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -EncodedCommand' argument. The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payload or commands that can perform harmful actions such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing unauthorized connections. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window), which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at avoiding detection. The presence of such obfuscated execution strongly indicates malicious intent, especially since it is not clear what the payload does without decoding the base64 string. Overall, this code exhibits behavior typical of malware or malicious scripts designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful commands.",
