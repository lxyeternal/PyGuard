The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package named 'selfhackedloadnvidia', which may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution and the presence of suspicious package metadata indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or persistence.",
