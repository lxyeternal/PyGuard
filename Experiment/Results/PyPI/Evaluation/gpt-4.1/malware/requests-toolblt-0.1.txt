      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded and obfuscated expressions. Notably, it attempts to import modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', and conditionally executes code such as creating shortcuts, deleting files, or accessing system information based on obscure, hard-to-read conditions. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with dynamic imports and file operations, strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at evading detection, executing unauthorized system modifications, or installing malicious packages. The final setup() call with a suspicious package name 'requests-toolblt' (likely a typo or obfuscation of 'requests-toolbelt') further indicates malicious intent, possibly to masquerade as legitimate software while installing or manipulating system components covertly.",
