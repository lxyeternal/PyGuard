It then attempts to run this temporary script with the current Python executable. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity, as it involves remote code execution, which can lead to remote control, data theft, or malware installation. The use of obfuscated or indirect code execution methods further suggests malicious intent.",
