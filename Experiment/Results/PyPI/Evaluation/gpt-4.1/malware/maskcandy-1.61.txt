      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The use of a hidden window and encoded command suggests an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command only if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, potentially to avoid repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated and conditional execution behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to perform covert operations on the host system.",
