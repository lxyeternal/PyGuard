This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves downloading and executing potentially harmful payloads without user consent or awareness. The repeated calls to `script()` within various class methods suggest an attempt to obfuscate or ensure execution of this malicious download. Overall, the code is designed to fetch and run malicious software, making it malicious.",
