      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within the custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes remote code fetched via a Fernet-encrypted payload. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to remote access, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscated class name, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows are typical indicators of malicious intent.",
