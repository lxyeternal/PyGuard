This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves data exfiltration without user consent or awareness. The purpose appears to be to gather environment details for further malicious use, such as targeted attacks, fingerprinting, or establishing a command-and-control channel. The code does not perform any legitimate installation tasks related to the package itself, indicating that its primary intent is covert data collection, which is malicious.",
