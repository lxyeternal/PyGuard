      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other harmful activities. The obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or exfiltrating data.",
