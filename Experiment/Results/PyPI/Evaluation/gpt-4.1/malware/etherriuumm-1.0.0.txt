      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes hidden code embedded within the script. Specifically, it uses the 'cryptography' Fernet module to decrypt an encrypted payload and then executes it via 'exec'. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code, as it attempts to conceal its true intent and execute arbitrary code during installation. The presence of obfuscated strings, encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggests malicious intent, likely to deliver malware, establish backdoors, or perform other harmful actions.",
