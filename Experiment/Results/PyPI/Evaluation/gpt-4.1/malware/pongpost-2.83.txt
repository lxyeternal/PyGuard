      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, potentially compromising the system. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to perform malicious actions covertly, rather than legitimate setup or package installation, especially given the obfuscation and silent execution. Overall, this code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware or malicious scripts designed to infect or control the host system.",
