      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom installation command. During the installation process, it attempts to retrieve a file from an external URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') and executes it silently using 'os.system'. Additionally, it sends the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' to a suspicious domain ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw '), likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. This behavior indicates an attempt to download and execute potentially harmful malware without user consent, which classifies the code as malicious.",
