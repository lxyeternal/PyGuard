      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zbu0qmv/ESQUELE.EXE'), potentially installing malware or performing unauthorized actions on the victim's system. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hinder detection and troubleshooting. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious intent, especially given the context and obfuscation techniques used.",
