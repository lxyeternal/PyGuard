      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.drobx.com/szgn9t9zbu0qmv/ESQEule.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command and silent error handling strongly suggests malicious intent.",
