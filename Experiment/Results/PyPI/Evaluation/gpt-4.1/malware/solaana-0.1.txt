      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious behavior. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing code based on environment variables, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor activity. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and environment-dependent logic strongly suggests malicious intent, likely aiming to evade detection and compromise the host system.",
