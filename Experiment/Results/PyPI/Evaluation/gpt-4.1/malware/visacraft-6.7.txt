      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique employed by malware to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing this command, which could be a mechanism to avoid repeated execution or to target specific environments. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, especially given the obfuscation and the use of PowerShell for potentially harmful operations.",
