The embedded base64 string, once decoded, executes arbitrary code that appears to perform network requests to external URLs (e.g., 'https://z3us.online/grab/miyOxGLuqZNlRELS'), potentially for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to run unauthorized commands, steal data, or establish backdoors on the compromised system.",
