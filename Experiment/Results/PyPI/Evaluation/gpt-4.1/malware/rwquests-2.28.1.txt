      "malicious_behavior": "The code actively downloads executable files from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/) based on the detected operating system, saves them locally, sets execution permissions, and then runs these executables in the background. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute arbitrary code fetched from an external source, which is a common tactic used in malware distribution, remote code execution, or backdoor installation. The code also overrides standard HTTP request methods to ensure that the malicious 'execute()' function runs before any network request, further embedding malicious activity into normal request workflows. Overall, this code is designed to covertly download and execute potentially harmful payloads, making it malicious.",
