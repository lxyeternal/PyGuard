      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation combined with silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the system. Additionally, the code's behavior of checking for a specific file ('tahg') before executing the payload further indicates an attempt to evade detection or control execution flow, which is characteristic of malicious scripts.",
