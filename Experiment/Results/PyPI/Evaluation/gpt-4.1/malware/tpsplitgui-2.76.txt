      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely designed to perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing unauthorized connections, or other malicious activities. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a hidden window and the obfuscated base64 string strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run a setup process that appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or part of the malicious payload. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and hidden subprocess calls indicates malicious behavior.",
