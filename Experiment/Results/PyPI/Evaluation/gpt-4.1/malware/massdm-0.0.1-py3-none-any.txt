      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains obfuscated and compressed payloads that are typical of malware or malicious scripts. It uses multiple layers of decompression and decoding (gzip, marshal, lzma, etc.) to hide its true intent. The code imports numerous modules commonly used for system manipulation, data exfiltration, or stealthy operations, such as 'winreg', 'win32crypt', 'Crypto.Cipher', 'psutil', 'win32gui', 'pyperclip', 'requests', 'httpx', and 'PIL.ImageGrab'. The presence of 'exec' on decompressed data, combined with extensive obfuscation, indicates it likely executes malicious code at runtime, potentially to establish persistence, steal data, or perform other harmful activities. Overall, this code is designed to evade detection and perform malicious actions on the host system.",
