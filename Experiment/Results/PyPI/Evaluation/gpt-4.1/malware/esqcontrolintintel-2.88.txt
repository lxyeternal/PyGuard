      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious payloads or activities. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment). Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution and external URL references strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing unauthorized actions.",
