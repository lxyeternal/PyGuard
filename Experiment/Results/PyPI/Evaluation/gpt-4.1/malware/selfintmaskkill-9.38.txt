      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to perform unauthorized actions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'WindowStyle Hidden' indicates an intent to conceal its activity. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing, which could be a simple anti-analysis or anti-sandbox measure. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent.",
