      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 that is executed silently using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag. This command is likely designed to perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package, which appears legitimate, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command indicates malicious intent. Overall, the script is likely intended to silently execute malicious code on the target system, making it malicious.",
