      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command decodes to a script that likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing additional payloads from external sources (e.g., 'dl.droppbx.com') without user consent. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently compromise the system, making the code malicious. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions suggests an effort to conceal or suppress errors, which is common in malicious scripts to avoid detection.",
