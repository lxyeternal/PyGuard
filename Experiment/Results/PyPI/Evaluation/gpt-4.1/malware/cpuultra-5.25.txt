      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded, making it difficult to analyze directly, but such obfuscation is a common tactic used by malware to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can be used to hide errors or failures in executing malicious payloads. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command execution strongly suggests malicious behavior, potentially aimed at compromising the system or downloading further malicious components.",
