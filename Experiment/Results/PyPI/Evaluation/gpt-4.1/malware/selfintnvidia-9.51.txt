      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run covertly on the target system, potentially downloading or executing harmful scripts or malware. The presence of such obfuscated command execution, especially without clear legitimate purpose, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to perform actions silently (hidden window, no window style) and suppresses exceptions, which are common tactics in malicious scripts to avoid detection and maintain persistence or execute malicious payloads covertly.",
