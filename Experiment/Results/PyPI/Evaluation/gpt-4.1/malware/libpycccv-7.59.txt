      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 that is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the PowerShell command. Additionally, the code attempts to run a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious activities or to facilitate further malicious actions. The combination of obfuscated code execution and the use of hidden PowerShell commands strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, payload download, or persistence mechanisms.",
