      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or commands that could compromise the system, such as downloading or executing malicious files. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then runs the PowerShell command, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or ensure the payload runs only under certain conditions. The use of 'powershell' with hidden window style and encoded commands is a common tactic in malicious scripts to conceal malicious activities from the user and security tools. Overall, this code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware or malicious scripts designed to execute hidden commands and potentially compromise the host system.",
