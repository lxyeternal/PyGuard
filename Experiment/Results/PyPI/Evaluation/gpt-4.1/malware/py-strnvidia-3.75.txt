      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload delivery. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with hidden window flags, indicating an intent to run covertly. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which could be a tactic to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, persistence, or other malicious activities.",
