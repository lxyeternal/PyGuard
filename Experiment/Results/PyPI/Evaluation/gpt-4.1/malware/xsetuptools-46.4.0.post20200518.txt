      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits typical characteristics of a data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication mechanism. It collects system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, encodes this data, and then transmits it covertly via DNS queries (using 'ping' commands with specially crafted domain names) and HTTP requests to external domains. The data is split into multiple parts, encoded in hexadecimal, and embedded within domain names or HTTP request parameters, making detection difficult. This pattern is consistent with malware attempting to stealthily send sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server, indicating malicious intent.",
