      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive configuration files from the user's system, specifically targeting game and account configuration files related to Minecraft and Lunar Client. It retrieves a URL from an obfuscated base64 string, which points to a remote server, and then sends the contents of these files via an HTTP POST request to that server, including a notification to '@everyone'. This behavior indicates an intent to harvest potentially sensitive user data without consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data theft or espionage.",
