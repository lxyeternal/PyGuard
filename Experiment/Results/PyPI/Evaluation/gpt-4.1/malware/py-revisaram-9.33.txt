      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command string. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package, which appears legitimate, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution suggests an attempt to perform malicious activities such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or downloading malware. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with 'creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an effort to run the command stealthily, making this code malicious.",
