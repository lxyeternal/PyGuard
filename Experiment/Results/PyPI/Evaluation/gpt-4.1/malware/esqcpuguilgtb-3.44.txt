      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL-like string in the encoded command). Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid repeated execution. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution, combined with the conditional check, strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing arbitrary code without user consent.",
