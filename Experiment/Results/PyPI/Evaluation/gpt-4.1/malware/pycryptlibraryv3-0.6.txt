      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious, designed to stealthily extract sensitive user data and system information without consent. It performs activities such as stealing browser passwords, cookies, history, credit card details, and Discord tokens. It also captures screenshots, gathers system info, and collects IP geolocation data. The code then compresses and exfiltrates this data to remote servers via webhooks and file uploads, effectively enabling unauthorized surveillance, credential theft, and data exfiltration. Additionally, it attempts to disable security measures, kill security-related processes, and persist on the victim's machine, all indicative of a comprehensive malware aimed at espionage, credential harvesting, and system compromise.",
