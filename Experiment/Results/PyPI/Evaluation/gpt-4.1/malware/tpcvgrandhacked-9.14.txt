      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in the comment). Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, potentially to avoid repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing arbitrary code without user consent.",
