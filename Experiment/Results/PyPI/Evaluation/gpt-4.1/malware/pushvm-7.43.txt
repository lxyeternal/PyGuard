      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other malicious actions. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' suggests obfuscation to hide the true intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing this command, possibly to avoid repeated execution or to target specific environments. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command and the conditional execution pattern strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at covertly executing malicious code or establishing persistence.",
