      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious scripts. The encoded command is likely designed to run hidden in the background without user awareness. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious distribution or to deceive analysis. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the seemingly benign package setup indicates malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or exfiltrate data.",
