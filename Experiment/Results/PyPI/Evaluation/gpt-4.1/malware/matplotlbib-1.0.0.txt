      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom install class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme, which is likely malicious payload. This behavior enables remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The obfuscation, use of encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggest malicious intent.",
