      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits typical characteristics of a data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication mechanism. It gathers system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, encodes this data, and then transmits it covertly via DNS queries (using 'ping' commands with specially crafted domain names) and HTTP requests to external domains. The data is obfuscated through base64 encoding and hex encoding, making detection more difficult. The use of DNS queries and HTTP requests to external servers suggests an attempt to stealthily send sensitive system information or receive commands, which is indicative of malicious activity such as malware or backdoor operation.",
