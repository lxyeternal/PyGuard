      "malicious_behavior": "The code establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server specified by the hostname '4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io' on port 10308. It creates a socket, connects to the remote server, redirects the standard input/output/error streams to this socket, and then executes a bash command that opens an interactive shell ('bash -i') with input/output redirected over TCP. This allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised machine, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially take full control of the system. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious remote access tools (RATs) and is commonly used for unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
