      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is a highly malicious information-stealing malware designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers, Discord tokens, and other applications. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- **Token Stealing:** It scans browser directories and Discord data to extract user tokens, which can be used to hijack accounts.\n- **Credential Extraction:** It retrieves saved passwords and cookies from browsers like Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, and Edge, capturing login credentials and session cookies.\n- **Account Data Collection:** It gathers user profile information, email, phone number, Nitro status, badges, billing info, and high-quality Discord friends.\n- **File Stealing:** It searches user directories for files containing sensitive keywords (e.g., passwords, accounts, crypto wallets) and zips them for exfiltration.\n- **Zip and Upload:** It compresses collected files and uploads them to external servers (e.g., via anonfiles or gofile), providing links to the attacker.\n- **Webhook Exfiltration:** It sends all stolen data, including tokens, credentials, and file links, to a Discord webhook controlled by the attacker.\n- **Persistence and Evasion:** It attempts to detect if the environment is suspicious (e.g., trust factor based on cookies) and kills certain processes to hide its activity.\n\nOverall, this code is clearly designed for malicious purposes, primarily to steal user credentials, tokens, files, and personal information for malicious use or account hijacking.",
