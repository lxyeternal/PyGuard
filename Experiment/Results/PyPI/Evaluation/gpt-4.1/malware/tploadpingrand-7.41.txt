      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment referencing a suspicious URL ('www.esquelesquad.rip') and the obfuscated nature of the command. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which suggests persistence or a check to avoid repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated and conditional remote command execution is characteristic of malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or establishing unauthorized control.",
