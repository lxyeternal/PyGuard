      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'WindowStyle Hidden' indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity, such as downloading, executing, or establishing remote access. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful setup or validation related to the 'setup' function, which appears to be a decoy or distraction. Overall, this behavior suggests malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, persistence, or other harmful actions.",
