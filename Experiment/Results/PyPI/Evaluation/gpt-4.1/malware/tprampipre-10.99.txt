      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious activity. The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command and the silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing arbitrary code without user consent.",
