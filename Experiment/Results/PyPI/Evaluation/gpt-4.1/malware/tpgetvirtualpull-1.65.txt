      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious payload designed to run arbitrary code or download/execute malicious content without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a seemingly legitimate Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration. Overall, the code exhibits typical behaviors associated with malware, including obfuscation and covert command execution.",
