      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, creates a temporary Python script ('code.py') in the system's temporary directory. This script imports a module named 'dshttpslib' without any context or legitimate reason. Immediately after, the installer waits for 3 seconds and then executes this script using a subprocess call. This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which could be used to run malicious payloads, download additional malware, or perform unauthorized actions on the host system. The use of a delay and the creation of a script that imports an obscure module are common tactics to obfuscate malicious intent. Overall, this pattern indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden or malicious code during the installation process.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed as a remote access trojan (RAT) with extensive malicious capabilities. It performs activities such as persistence setup (copying itself to startup folder), credential theft from browsers (passwords, cookies, credit cards, history), token harvesting from Discord and browsers, screenshot and webcam capture, keylogging, file collection (wallets, backups, sensitive files), file encryption/decryption, and remote command execution. It communicates with a command-and-control server via socket.io, allowing an attacker to control the infected machine, exfiltrate data, and execute arbitrary commands. The code also includes obfuscation tactics and functions that facilitate stealth and data theft, clearly indicating malicious intent.",
