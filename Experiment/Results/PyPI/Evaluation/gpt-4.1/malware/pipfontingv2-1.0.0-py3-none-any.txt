It performs extensive data theft activities, including stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and sensitive information from browsers and applications. It exfiltrates user data to remote servers via webhooks and file uploads, captures screenshots, and searches for specific files related to cryptocurrencies, wallets, and accounts. The code also attempts to disable security features, kill security-related processes, and manipulate browser data to facilitate theft. Its behavior is consistent with malware designed for espionage, credential theft, and unauthorized data exfiltration, making it unequivocally malicious.",
