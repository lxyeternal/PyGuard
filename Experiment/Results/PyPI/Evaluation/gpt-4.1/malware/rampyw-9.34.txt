      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique employed by malware to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing this command, which could be a method to avoid detection or re-execution. Overall, these behaviors suggest the code is designed to perform malicious actions, such as executing hidden PowerShell commands, potentially leading to system compromise or data theft.",
