      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is a common technique for obfuscating malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other malicious actions. The encoded command is likely designed to evade detection and could perform harmful operations on the system. Additionally, the code silently ignores exceptions, which can hide errors and hinder analysis. Overall, the presence of obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
