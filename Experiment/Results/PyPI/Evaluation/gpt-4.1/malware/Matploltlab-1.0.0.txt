      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes a hidden payload using Fernet encryption, which is likely to be malicious. The payload is fetched and run dynamically, making detection difficult and indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity. This behavior suggests the code is designed to perform unauthorized actions, such as executing malicious code or establishing backdoors, upon installation.",
