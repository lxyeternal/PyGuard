      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a post-installation script that, upon installation of the package, establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server at IP 49.233.121.53 on port 54. This allows an attacker to gain remote control over the compromised system, potentially executing arbitrary commands. The use of base64 encoding for the IP and port obscures the malicious intent, and the reverse shell functionality is a common tactic in malicious code to facilitate unauthorized access. Overall, this code is designed to secretly create a backdoor, making it malicious.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a system command that outputs a message indicating successful malicious code execution. Although the current command is benign ('echo'), the use of os.system() to run shell commands can be exploited to execute arbitrary malicious commands, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or other harmful actions. The comment suggests that additional malicious behaviors could be added, indicating intent to perform malicious activities.",
