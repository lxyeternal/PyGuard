      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload delivery. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with hidden window flags, indicating an intent to run malicious or unauthorized code silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the payload, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or control execution conditions. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional behavior strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities.",
