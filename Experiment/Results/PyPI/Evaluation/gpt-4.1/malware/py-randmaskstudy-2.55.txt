      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, execute, or manipulate system resources without user consent. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this payload only if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, which may be used to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution indicates malicious intent, as it is a common tactic used in malware to evade detection and perform harmful actions.",
