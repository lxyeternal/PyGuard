      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server at IP 39.101.72.63 on port 4242. It then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh). This behavior allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised system, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially cause significant harm. Such functionality is characteristic of malicious backdoors or remote access Trojans (RATs).",
