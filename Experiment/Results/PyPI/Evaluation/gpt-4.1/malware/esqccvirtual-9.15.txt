      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to download, install, or execute malicious payloads silently. The setup() function appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the malicious subprocess call, suggesting the script is primarily intended for malicious purposes.",
