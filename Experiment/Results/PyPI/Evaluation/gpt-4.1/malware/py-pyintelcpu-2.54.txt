      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run hidden or stealthy operations, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' combined with hidden window flags and exception handling suggests an intent to conceal malicious activity. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to run this obfuscated command without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.",
