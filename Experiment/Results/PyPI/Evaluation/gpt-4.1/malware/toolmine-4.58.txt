      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses command window display. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as downloading, executing, or hiding malicious payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code silently ignores exceptions, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command strongly suggests malicious intent, likely to perform malicious actions such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing arbitrary code covertly.",
