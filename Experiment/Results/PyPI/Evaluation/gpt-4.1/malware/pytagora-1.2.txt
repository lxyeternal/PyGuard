      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that, when decoded and executed via the exec() function, likely performs malicious actions. The embedded payload appears to be obfuscated, which is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. The rest of the code implements mathematical functions (hypotenuse and other calculations) that seem benign, but the presence of the obfuscated exec() payload indicates malicious behavior. This payload could potentially download, execute, or manipulate system resources, leading to security compromise.",
