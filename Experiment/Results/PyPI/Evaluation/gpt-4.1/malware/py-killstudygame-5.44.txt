      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, which may serve as a decoy or to blend malicious activity with legitimate operations. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading, installing, or executing malicious payloads, remote control, or persistence mechanisms.",
