      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or payloads silently on the target system. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears legitimate but is likely a cover for the malicious activity. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and silent execution indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
