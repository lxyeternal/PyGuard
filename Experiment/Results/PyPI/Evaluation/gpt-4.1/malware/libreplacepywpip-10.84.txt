      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which can be a tactic to avoid detection or repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a base64-encoded payload strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing persistence. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command indicates malicious behavior.",
