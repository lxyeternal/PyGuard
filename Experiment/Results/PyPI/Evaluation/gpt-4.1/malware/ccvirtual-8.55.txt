      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (as indicated by 'Hidden' window style and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag). This behavior suggests an attempt to perform unauthorized or harmful actions on the system, such as downloading, installing, or executing malicious payloads without user consent. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions indicates an attempt to conceal or ignore errors, which is common in malicious scripts to avoid detection or interruption.",
