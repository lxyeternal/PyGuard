      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which may serve as a cover for malicious activity or to avoid suspicion. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the lack of clear legitimate purpose indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware download.",
