      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that executes decrypted malicious code during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it uses the Fernet encryption scheme to decrypt a payload and executes it via the exec() function, which can run arbitrary malicious commands or code. This behavior is concealed within a custom install command class and only triggers on Windows (nt) systems, making it a targeted backdoor. The presence of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during setup strongly indicate malicious intent, such as remote code execution or system compromise.",
