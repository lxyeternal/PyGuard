      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server at IP address 104.248.19.57 on port 3334. It then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh). This behavior allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised system, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially exfiltrate data, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as backdooring or remote access trojans.",
