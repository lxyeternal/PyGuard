This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows remote code execution, which can be exploited to run arbitrary malicious code on the host system. The request to an external server and dynamic execution of its response indicates malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or installing malicious payloads.",

It then performs an HTTP GET request to this URL and executes the response text as Python code using `exec()`. This behavior is highly suspicious because executing remote code without validation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to run malicious commands, install malware, or compromise the system. The code effectively acts as a backdoor or remote command execution mechanism, making it malicious.",
