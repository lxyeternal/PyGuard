      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely designed to perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a hidden window and the obfuscated command strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this payload only if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, which could be a tactic to avoid detection or re-execution. Overall, this behavior is characteristic of malware or malicious scripts aiming to compromise the system.",
