      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially executed without user awareness or consent, indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code, but the hidden PowerShell invocation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior.",
