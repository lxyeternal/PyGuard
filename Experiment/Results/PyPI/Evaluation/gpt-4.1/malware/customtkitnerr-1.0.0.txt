      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that executes decrypted code when run on Windows systems. Specifically, during installation, it decrypts a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption and executes it via the exec() function. This behavior allows an attacker to run arbitrary malicious code on the target machine, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscated class and variable names, along with the encrypted payload, are typical indicators of malicious intent designed to evade detection.",
