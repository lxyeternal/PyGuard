      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior suggests an attempt to silently run malicious code during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated class names further indicates malicious intent to evade detection.",
