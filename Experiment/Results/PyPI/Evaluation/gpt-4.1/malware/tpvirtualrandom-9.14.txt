      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially for remote control, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code's presence of such obfuscated execution without clear legitimate purpose indicates malicious intent. The setup function appears benign but is likely used to mask or facilitate the malicious activity, making the overall script malicious.",
