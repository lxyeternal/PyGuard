      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code proceeds to run a setup function that appears legitimate, but the initial obfuscated PowerShell command indicates malicious intent. Overall, the presence of hidden command execution with obfuscated payloads and conditional triggers strongly suggests malicious behavior designed to compromise the system.",
