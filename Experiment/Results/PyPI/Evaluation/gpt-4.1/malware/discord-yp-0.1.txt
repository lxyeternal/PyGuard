      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules like 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', which are often used for system-level operations or privilege escalation. The code also manipulates environment variables, creates shortcuts, and interacts with the filesystem in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor behavior. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic attribute access, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activities such as installing malicious packages, escalating privileges, or executing hidden payloads. Overall, this code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious scripts intended to compromise or control the host system.",
