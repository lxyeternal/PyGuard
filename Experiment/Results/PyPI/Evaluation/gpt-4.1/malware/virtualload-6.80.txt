      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The use of a hidden window and encoded command suggests an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to run hidden, obfuscated commands without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious behavior. The subsequent setup() call for a seemingly benign package may be a decoy or a cover for the malicious activity.",
