      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically decoded payloads that execute potentially harmful actions. It decodes base64-encoded data and uses eval to execute code at runtime, which is a common technique to hide malicious activities. The payloads include references to remote URLs, likely for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication, and perform actions such as retrieving data from external sources, executing commands, or manipulating files. The presence of such obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and external network interactions strongly indicates malicious intent, such as malware download, data theft, or remote control.",
