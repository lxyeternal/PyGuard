      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), the user's home directory, and the current working directory. It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server ('https://pypi.org/reqs?d='). This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration, which is often associated with malicious activity such as malware or spyware attempting to gather and transmit user or system information without consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and the transmission of potentially sensitive data to an external server strongly suggest malicious intent.",
