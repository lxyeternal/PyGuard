      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious information-stealing malware designed to extract sensitive user data from infected systems. It performs numerous malicious activities, including: \n- Installing and importing various modules to facilitate system access and data extraction.\n- Collecting system information such as hardware IDs, IP address, geolocation, and system details.\n- Extracting and decrypting stored browser credentials, cookies, history, credit card info, and saved passwords from multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Brave, Yandex, etc.).\n- Harvesting Discord tokens, user IDs, email, phone, Nitro status, badges, and billing info by parsing local storage and database files.\n- Stealing Roblox cookies and other gaming-related credentials.\n- Taking screenshots of the user's desktop.\n- Gathering system info and compiling it into files.\n- Zipping and uploading all stolen data to external servers or file-sharing services.\n- Sending detailed reports, including geolocation, system info, tokens, and stolen credentials, via Discord webhook.\n- Persisting by copying itself to startup folders.\n- Detecting and killing security or debugging tools, virtual machine environments, and sandboxing attempts.\n- Searching user directories for files containing keywords related to passwords, crypto wallets, tokens, and sensitive data, then uploading these files.\n- Exfiltrating data anonymously via external hosting services.\n\nOverall, the code's behavior is consistent with malware aimed at data theft, credential harvesting, and system compromise, which are malicious activities.",
