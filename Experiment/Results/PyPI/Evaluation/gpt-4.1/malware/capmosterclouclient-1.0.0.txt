      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that executes encrypted code when run on Windows systems. Specifically, during the installation process, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an embedded encrypted payload using Fernet, and executes the decrypted code via 'exec'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The obfuscation of strings and the use of encrypted payloads further suggest malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and execute malicious actions without user awareness.",
