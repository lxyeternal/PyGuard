      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains embedded base64-encoded payloads that, when decoded and executed, perform malicious activities. Specifically, the payloads decode into scripts that attempt to download and run remote scripts or binaries from external URLs, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The presence of obfuscated code, base64 decoding, and execution of decoded content strongly indicates malicious intent. The code appears designed to fetch and execute malicious payloads from external sources, potentially installing malware or backdoors on the host system.",
