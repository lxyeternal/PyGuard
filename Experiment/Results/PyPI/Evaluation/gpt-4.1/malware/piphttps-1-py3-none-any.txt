It decrypts stored tokens, verifies their validity by making API requests to Discord, and then exfiltrates sensitive user information—including tokens, email, phone number, account details, IP address, and system info—to a remote Discord webhook. This behavior constitutes malicious activity, as it involves unauthorized access to and transmission of private user data without consent, aiming to hijack user accounts and compromise privacy.",
