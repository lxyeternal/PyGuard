      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a post-installation hook that, upon installation, creates a network connection to an external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090 and transmits system information such as uptime, OS details, and IP address. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it exfiltrates sensitive system data to an external server without user consent. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign actions that justify this network communication, indicating it is designed for malicious purposes such as data theft, remote control, or surveillance.",
