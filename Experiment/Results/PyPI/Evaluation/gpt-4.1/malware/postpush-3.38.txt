      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, potentially compromising the system. Additionally, the code includes a setup function that appears legitimate but is wrapped in a try-except block, possibly to mask its presence or prevent detection. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with silent operation strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at executing malicious code or payloads covertly.",
