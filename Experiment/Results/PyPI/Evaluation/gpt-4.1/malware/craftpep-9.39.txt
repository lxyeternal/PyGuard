      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, potentially compromising the system. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions suggests an attempt to suppress errors, which is typical in malicious scripts to avoid detection or debugging. Overall, these behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent aimed at executing hidden, obfuscated commands that could lead to system compromise or data theft.",
