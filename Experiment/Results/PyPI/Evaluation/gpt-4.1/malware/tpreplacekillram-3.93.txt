      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, malware, or backdoors. The encoded command is likely designed to evade detection and could perform harmful actions on the system. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide errors and hinder analysis. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, especially given the context of the code attempting to run hidden commands without user awareness.",
