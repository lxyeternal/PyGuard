Additionally, it sends sensitive environment information (the 'COMPUTERNAME') to an external server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation <COMPUTERNAME>'). This behavior indicates an attempt to infect the host system with malware and exfiltrate system details, which are typical malicious actions.",
