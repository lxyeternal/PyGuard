Additionally, it sends an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain (`https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php`) with environment information, potentially exfiltrating data. This behavior indicates malicious intent, such as downloading and executing malware, and collecting system information without user consent.",
