      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or behavior, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads from external sources. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which can be a tactic to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks indicates malicious intent, potentially used for malware delivery, persistence, or remote control.",
