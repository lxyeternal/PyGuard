      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command string. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command only if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, possibly to avoid detection or repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing harmful scripts on the host system.",
