      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when executed on a Windows system, decrypts and executes hidden code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code during installation, which could lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payloads, and execution during setup strongly suggests malicious intent.",
