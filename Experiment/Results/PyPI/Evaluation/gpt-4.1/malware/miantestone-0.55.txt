This behavior is suspicious because it collects and exfiltrates system information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data harvesting or reconnaissance. The code does not perform any legitimate setup-related functions with this data, indicating an intent to secretly gather and transmit user system details, thus classifying it as malicious.",
