      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom installation class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched from a Fernet-encrypted string, which is likely to be malicious payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently run malicious code during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or system compromise. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payload, and execution during setup strongly suggest malicious intent.",
