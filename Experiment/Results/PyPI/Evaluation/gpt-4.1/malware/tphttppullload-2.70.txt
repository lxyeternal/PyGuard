      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the PowerShell invocation. Additionally, the code attempts to run setup procedures that appear legitimate but are likely used to mask or facilitate malicious activities. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the silent execution with hidden window style strongly suggest malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
