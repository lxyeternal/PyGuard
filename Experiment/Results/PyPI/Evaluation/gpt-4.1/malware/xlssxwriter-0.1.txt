      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses the 'pip.main()' function to install packages, and later attempts to create shortcuts or manipulate files and directories based on dynamically generated paths and environment variables. Additionally, it conditionally executes code that interacts with system components such as 'win32com' and 'ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin()', which can be used to escalate privileges or perform malicious system modifications. The overall structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, such as installing malicious packages, creating shortcuts, or exfiltrating data, while attempting to evade detection through code obfuscation.",
