      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules like 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', which are often used for system modifications or privilege escalation. The code also constructs and executes system commands, manipulates files, and creates shortcuts with obfuscated strings, likely to execute or install malicious payloads covertly. The presence of convoluted calculations, dynamic code execution, and environment variable access strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising system security or installing malware. The obfuscation techniques are typical of malicious scripts attempting to evade detection and analysis.",
