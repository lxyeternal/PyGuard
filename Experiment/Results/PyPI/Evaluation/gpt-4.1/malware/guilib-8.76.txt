      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as executing obfuscated or malicious scripts. The encoded command is likely designed to run malicious code or establish unauthorized access, especially since it is run with hidden window style and no window, making it stealthy. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful or legitimate setup tasks; instead, it silently executes potentially harmful commands. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as malware download, remote code execution, or persistence mechanisms.",
