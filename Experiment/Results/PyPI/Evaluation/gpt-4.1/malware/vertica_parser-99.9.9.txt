      "malicious_behavior": "The code secretly performs DNS-based data exfiltration by encoding system information (hostname, username, current directory) into a JSON payload, converting it to a hex string, splitting it into chunks, and sending these chunks via DNS queries to a domain controlled by an attacker. This behavior is covert and designed to transmit sensitive information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious data exfiltration techniques. The package description claims it is harmless and for research purposes only, but the embedded DNS exfiltration logic indicates malicious intent.",
