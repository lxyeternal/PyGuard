      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden payload that decrypts and executes obfuscated code only on Windows systems. It uses the Fernet encryption scheme to decrypt a payload and execute it dynamically via `exec()`. This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to conceal malicious activities, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or downloading additional malware. The use of obfuscation, conditional execution based on OS, and dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
