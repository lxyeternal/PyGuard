      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded and obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses the 'pip.main()' function to install packages, which is deprecated and potentially dangerous, and it manipulates system files and environment variables. Additionally, it creates shortcuts and interacts with system directories, potentially executing or installing malicious payloads. The overall obfuscation, combined with dynamic code execution and system modifications, strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at covertly installing or executing harmful code, possibly with privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.",
