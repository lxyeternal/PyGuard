      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable ('neu2.exe') from an external URL, which could be malware. It then checks for Java installation and, if present, downloads a Java archive ('dcbot.jar') to the user's startup folder, ensuring persistence by executing it on system startup. This behavior indicates an attempt to establish persistent malicious control over the infected system, typical of malware or remote access trojans (RATs). The use of external URLs, silent downloads, and startup persistence mechanisms strongly suggest malicious intent.",
