      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed code via base64 decoding and eval, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. Specifically, it decodes a base64 string, then executes it with eval, which can run arbitrary malicious code. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with the eval of decoded data, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or executing unauthorized commands. Additionally, the code's comments and structure suggest it is designed to scrape and interact with a specific adult website, but the obfuscated eval execution is a clear red flag for malicious intent.",
