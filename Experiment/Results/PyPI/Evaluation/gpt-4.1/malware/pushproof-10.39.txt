      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is a common technique for obfuscating malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing reverse shells, or maintaining persistence. The encoded command is likely designed to evade detection and could perform harmful actions on the target system. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, especially given the obfuscated PowerShell command and silent failure handling.",
