      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within the custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the 'fernet' library, which is embedded as a base64-encoded key and ciphertext. This behavior allows the attacker to run arbitrary malicious code silently during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of obfuscation, conditional execution, and embedded encrypted payload strongly indicates malicious intent.",
