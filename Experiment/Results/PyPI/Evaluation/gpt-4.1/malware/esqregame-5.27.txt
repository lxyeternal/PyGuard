      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious code. This behavior suggests an attempt to run potentially harmful scripts or payloads silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, indicating an attempt to evade detection or control execution flow. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing unauthorized access.",
