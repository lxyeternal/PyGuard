      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden data exfiltration mechanism that encodes system and environment information into a hex string, splits it into chunks, and encodes it into DNS queries sent to a specified domain. This behavior is characteristic of covert data exfiltration via DNS tunneling, which is often used for malicious purposes such as unauthorized data theft or command-and-control communication. Despite the package's claim of being benign and for research purposes, the DNS request pattern and encoding strongly suggest malicious intent or at least covert data transmission, making the code malicious.",
