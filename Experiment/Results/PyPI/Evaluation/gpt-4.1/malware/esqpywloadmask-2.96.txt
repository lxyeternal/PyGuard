      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run covertly on the victim's machine, potentially downloading or executing harmful content. The presence of such obfuscated command execution, especially without clear purpose, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently and hides its window, further suggesting malicious behavior aimed at evading detection. The rest of the script appears to be benign setup code, but the embedded PowerShell command is a significant red flag for malicious activity.",
