      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encoded payloads that, when decoded, perform network requests to external URLs, potentially exfiltrate data, or execute arbitrary code. It imports modules related to GPT and system operations, but the core logic involves decoding a base64-encoded string that, upon execution, makes HTTP requests to external servers, possibly to download or execute malicious payloads. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution via `exec`, and external network activity strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote command execution, data exfiltration, or malware download.",
