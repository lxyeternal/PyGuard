      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The presence of this obfuscated command suggests malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful operations. Additionally, the code's attempt to set up a Python package with seemingly benign metadata may be a cover or distraction, but the core suspicious activity is the silent execution of the encoded PowerShell command.",
