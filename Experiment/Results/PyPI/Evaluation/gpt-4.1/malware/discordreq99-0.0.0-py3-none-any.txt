      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains heavily obfuscated and dynamically loaded components that suggest malicious intent. It uses obfuscated string literals, dynamic import and execution of code via `exec` and `__import__`, and references to external resources such as GitHub, Discord, and a license that may be used for command and control or payload delivery. The presence of functions that execute code from decoded strings, combined with the complex, intentionally confusing structure, indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads or behaviors. Additionally, the code appears to perform arbitrary calculations and control flow manipulations that could be used to evade detection or execute malicious actions at runtime. Overall, these signs strongly suggest the code is designed for malicious purposes, such as executing hidden payloads, establishing remote control, or performing other harmful activities.",
