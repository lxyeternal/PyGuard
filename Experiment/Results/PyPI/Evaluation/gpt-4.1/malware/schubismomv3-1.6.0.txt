      "malicious_behavior": "The code installs a Python script ('gruppe.py') into the user's APPDATA directory and executes it without any user consent or transparency. The embedded 'content' variable contains encrypted code that, when decrypted, executes a Fernet-encrypted payload, which is highly indicative of malicious activity. This behavior suggests the script is designed to deliver and run malicious payloads, potentially for remote access, data theft, or other harmful purposes. The use of obfuscation, silent installation, and execution of encrypted code strongly indicates malicious intent.",
