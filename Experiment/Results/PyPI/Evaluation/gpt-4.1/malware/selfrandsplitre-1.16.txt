      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the command string. Additionally, the code attempts to run setup procedures that appear legitimate but are wrapped in try-except blocks, possibly to conceal malicious activity or to avoid detection if dependencies are missing. Overall, the presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
