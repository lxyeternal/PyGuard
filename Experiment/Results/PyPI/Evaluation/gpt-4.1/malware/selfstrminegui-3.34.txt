      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, it checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a mechanism to avoid detection or re-execution. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and conditional execution suggests an intent to perform malicious activities such as downloading, executing payloads, or establishing persistence, making this code malicious.",
