      "malicious_behavior": "The code is heavily obfuscated and appears to be designed to execute hidden or malicious payloads. It decodes base64-encoded strings, evaluates them as code, and dynamically reconstructs functions and variables, likely to evade detection. The presence of eval, base64 decoding, and dynamic code execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing additional malware, exfiltrating data, or establishing backdoors. Overall, this code is malicious and intended to perform harmful actions while avoiding straightforward analysis.",
