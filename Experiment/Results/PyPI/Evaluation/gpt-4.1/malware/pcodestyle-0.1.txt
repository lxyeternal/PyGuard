      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that serve as a form of code concealment, making static analysis difficult. It dynamically constructs and executes code, including installing packages via pip, creating shortcuts, manipulating files, and potentially executing system commands or malicious payloads. The use of dynamic string assembly, indirect module imports, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests an intent to hide malicious activities such as remote code execution, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The presence of code that interacts with system components (e.g., win32com, os, ctypes) and creates shortcuts or manipulates files indicates malicious intent to compromise or control the host system. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malware or backdoor scripts designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions.",
