      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload using the Fernet encryption scheme. The embedded encrypted data and the use of the 'exec' function to run decrypted code indicate malicious intent, as it likely downloads or executes malicious code without user awareness. The obfuscation of variable names and the encrypted payload further suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity, such as remote code execution or malware installation.",
