      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and performs multiple layers of decoding, decryption, and execution of dynamically reconstructed code. It uses a cryptographic key to decrypt data, then decodes it from base64, and finally executes the resulting code with `exec()`. The presence of such complex, layered decoding combined with the execution of dynamically generated code strongly indicates malicious intent, such as hiding payloads, malware, or backdoors. The code's purpose appears to be to conceal malicious operations, potentially to download, install, or execute harmful payloads on the target system, making it malicious behavior.",
