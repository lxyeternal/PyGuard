The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payloads such as malware, backdoors, or remote access tools. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which may serve as a cover for the malicious activity. The use of hidden window flags and obfuscated commands indicates an intent to conceal malicious operations, making this code malicious.",
