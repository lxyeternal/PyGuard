It then attempts to run this temporary script with the current Python executable. This behavior is highly suspicious because it involves downloading and executing arbitrary code from the internet, which can lead to remote code execution, malware installation, data theft, or system compromise. The code's purpose appears to be to silently execute malicious payloads from an external source, making it malicious.",
