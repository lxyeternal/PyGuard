      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, indicating an attempt to evade detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote control, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities.",
