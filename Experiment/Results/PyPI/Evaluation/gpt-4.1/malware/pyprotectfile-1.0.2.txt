      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and encrypted behavior designed to conceal its true purpose. It dynamically reconstructs and executes code through multiple layers of encoding, compression, and obfuscation, including base64, zlib, and character code manipulations. The presence of encoded strings, such as the base64-encoded payload, and the use of eval() to execute dynamically decoded code strongly suggest malicious intent. This pattern is typical of malware or backdoors that aim to hide malicious payloads, potentially allowing remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities. Overall, the code is designed to evade detection and execute hidden malicious operations, confirming its malicious nature.",
