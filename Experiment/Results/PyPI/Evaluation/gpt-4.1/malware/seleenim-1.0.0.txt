      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code. Specifically, it uses the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme to decrypt a payload and then executes it with `exec()`. This behavior indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads within the package setup process, potentially allowing remote code execution or malware installation without user awareness. The obfuscated class and variable names further suggest an intent to conceal malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to perform malicious actions during installation, making it malicious.",
