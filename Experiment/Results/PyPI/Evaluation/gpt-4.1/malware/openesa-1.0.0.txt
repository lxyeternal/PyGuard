      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via the Fernet encryption scheme. Specifically, during the installation process, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload and executes it with 'exec()'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary malicious code during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation of variable names and the embedded encrypted payload are typical tactics used to hide malicious intent.",
