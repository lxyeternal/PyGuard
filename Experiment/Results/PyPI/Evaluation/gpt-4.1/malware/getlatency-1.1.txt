      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file containing a Python script that fetches and executes code from a remote URL ('http://54.237.36.60/inject/QrvxFGKvsSJ5E5bx') using urllib.request. This remote code execution can lead to arbitrary code being run on the victim's machine, which is a common malicious behavior. Additionally, the script attempts to start a new process with a filename derived from the current executable, appending 'w.exe', and passes the temporary file as an argument. This behavior suggests an attempt to execute or inject malicious code, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
