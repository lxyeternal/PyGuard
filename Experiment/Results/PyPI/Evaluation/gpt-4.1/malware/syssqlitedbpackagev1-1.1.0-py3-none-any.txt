      "malicious_behavior": "The code decrypts and executes a payload obtained via a hardcoded encrypted string, which is a common technique used in malware to conceal malicious actions. It installs the 'fernet' library dynamically, then uses it to decrypt a large encrypted blob, and executes the resulting code with 'exec'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run hidden, potentially harmful code without user awareness, making it malicious. The use of encryption and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or other harmful activities.",
