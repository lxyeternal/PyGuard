      "malicious_behavior": "The code actively downloads executable files from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/) based on the operating system detected. It then sets executable permissions on Linux or macOS systems and executes these files in the background. On Windows, it uses the 'start' command to run the downloaded files. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently fetch and run potentially malicious payloads from an external source, which is characteristic of malware or remote code execution attacks. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and is designed to compromise the host system by executing arbitrary code fetched from an external server.",
