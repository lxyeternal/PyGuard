      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during the installation process, executes obfuscated code fetched and decrypted at runtime. Specifically, it uses the 'requests' and 'fernet' libraries to decrypt and execute a payload, which is highly indicative of malicious activity. This behavior suggests the code is designed to silently download and execute malicious code on the target system, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation and runtime execution of decrypted payloads are common tactics used by malware to evade detection.",
