      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions, such as downloading and executing malware from an external source. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which can be a tactic to avoid detection or re-infection. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
