      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor behavior. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, environment variable access, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at covertly compromising the system, exfiltrating data, or establishing persistence. The presence of code that interacts with system internals (e.g., win32com, ctypes, os functions) and the convoluted logic indicates an attempt to evade detection and perform malicious operations under the guise of legitimate setup procedures.",
