      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is run with a hidden window (creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW), indicating an intent to operate covertly. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, as suggested by the presence of a URL-like string within the base64 payload. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with hidden process creation strongly indicates malicious intent, such as malware download, persistence, or remote control.",
