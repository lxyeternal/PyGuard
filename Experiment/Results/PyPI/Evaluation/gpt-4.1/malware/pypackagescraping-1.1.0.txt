      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to perform extensive malicious activities including data theft, credential harvesting, system information gathering, and exfiltration. It captures browser passwords, cookies, and history from multiple browsers, extracts Discord tokens, Roblox cookies, and other sensitive data, and uploads these to external servers. It also attempts to identify virtual machine environments and sandboxing to evade detection. Additionally, it can kill security and debugging processes, modify browser files, and create ZIP archives of stolen data for exfiltration. The code communicates with external URLs under the guise of legitimate requests but primarily functions as malware aimed at compromising user privacy and security.",
