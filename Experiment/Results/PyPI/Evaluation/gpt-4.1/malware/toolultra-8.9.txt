      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The encoded command is likely obfuscated to evade detection. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder analysis. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with silent error handling strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions.",
