      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run potentially harmful code silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, indicating an attempt to avoid detection or repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or compromising the system.",
