      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious intent. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command, especially with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and the use of encoded commands, strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at stealthy remote code execution or payload delivery.",
