      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs malicious activities by retrieving and executing a potentially harmful executable from an external URL during installation. Specifically, it sends the system's 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to a suspicious domain, then downloads an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') from a remote server ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') and executes it using the system's default method. This behavior indicates an attempt to infect the host system with malware, making the code malicious.",
