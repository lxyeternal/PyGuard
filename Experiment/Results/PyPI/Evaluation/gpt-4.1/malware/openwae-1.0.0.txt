      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes hidden code via the Fernet symmetric encryption module. This behavior suggests an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware distribution or backdoor installation. The use of obfuscated class names, encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows further indicates malicious intent to evade detection and target specific environments.",
