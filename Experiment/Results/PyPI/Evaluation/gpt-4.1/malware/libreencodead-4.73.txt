      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or download/execute harmful content silently. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise or hide malicious activity under the guise of a setup script, which is a common tactic in malware to evade detection. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
