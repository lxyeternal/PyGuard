      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as executing obfuscated or malicious scripts. The encoded command is likely designed to evade detection and could perform harmful actions like downloading or executing malware, establishing unauthorized remote access, or other malicious operations. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
