      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run arbitrary payloads or download/execute malicious content without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or part of the malicious payload. The use of try-except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malware, such as stealthy command execution and obfuscation, indicating it is malicious.",
