      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given the obfuscation and use of hidden execution. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with setup operations, which may be used to disguise malicious activity or avoid detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent operations strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at executing hidden or harmful code on the target system.",
