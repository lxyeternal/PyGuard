      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zbuB0qmv/EsqUele.exe'), potentially installing malware or performing unauthorized actions on the victim's system. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently with broad except clauses, which can hide failures or malicious activity. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and silent error handling strongly suggests malicious intent.",
