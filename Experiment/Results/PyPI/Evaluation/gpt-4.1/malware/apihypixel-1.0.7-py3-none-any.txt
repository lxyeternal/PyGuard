      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive user information such as IP address, username, operating system details, and potentially sensitive configuration files related to gaming accounts (e.g., Minecraft and Feather). It then exfiltrates this data to a remote server via an HTTP POST request to a URL obtained dynamically from a base64-encoded string. The purpose appears to be unauthorized data harvesting, which can be used for malicious activities such as identity theft, account hijacking, or further exploitation. The code does not perform any legitimate or user-consented actions, indicating it is designed for malicious intent.",
