      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing harmful payloads. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, which may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious activity. The use of hidden window flags, encoded commands, and conditional execution based on file existence are common tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection and maintain persistence.",
