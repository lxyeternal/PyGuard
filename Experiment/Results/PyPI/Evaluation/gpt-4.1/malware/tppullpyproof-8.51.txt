      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious activity. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
