      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is hidden and obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, preventing detection of errors that could reveal malicious intent. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious payloads without user awareness.",
