      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or commands designed to run covertly without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional behavior strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially used for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.",
