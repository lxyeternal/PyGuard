Specifically, it appears to send sensitive information such as system details, user information, and possibly credentials to external servers controlled by an attacker. The payload includes obfuscated code that creates and runs subprocesses, makes HTTP requests to external URLs, and may execute further malicious scripts or commands. This behavior indicates an intent to exfiltrate data, compromise the host system, or perform other malicious actions, which classifies the code as malicious.",
