      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/szgn9t9zbu' embedded in the base64 string). Additionally, the code creates a setup script that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or a means to disguise malicious activity. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation.",
