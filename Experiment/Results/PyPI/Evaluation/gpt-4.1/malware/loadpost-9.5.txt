      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (as indicated by 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW'). This behavior suggests an attempt to execute arbitrary or malicious code without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run potentially harmful commands, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The subsequent setup call appears benign but is likely a decoy or part of the obfuscation. Overall, the presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
