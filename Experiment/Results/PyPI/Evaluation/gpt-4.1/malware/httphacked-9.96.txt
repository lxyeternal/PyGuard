      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is hidden, making it difficult to analyze directly, and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique in malware to obfuscate malicious actions. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing this command, which could be a mechanism to avoid detection or re-execution. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution or persistence mechanisms.",
