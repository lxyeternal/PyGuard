      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload using Fernet encryption. The payload is embedded as an encrypted string within the code, and its execution is triggered automatically during the setup process. This behavior indicates an attempt to run malicious code stealthily during installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. The use of encryption to hide the payload and the automatic execution during setup are common tactics in malicious software to evade detection and compromise the target system.",
