      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious software or scripts. Additionally, the code's attempt to run this command without any validation or user consent further indicates malicious behavior. The subsequent setup call appears benign but is likely a decoy or part of the obfuscation, as it does not mitigate the malicious activity. Overall, the code exhibits typical characteristics of malware or malicious scripts designed to evade detection and execute harmful actions silently.",
