      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command is likely obfuscated to evade detection. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious intent or to appear as legitimate software. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the silent execution without user awareness strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence.",
