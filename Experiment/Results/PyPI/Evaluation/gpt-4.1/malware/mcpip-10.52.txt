      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The use of a hidden window and encoded command suggests an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration for a Python package, which appears legitimate but may be used as a cover for malicious distribution or to facilitate further malicious activities. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the context suggests malicious intent.",
