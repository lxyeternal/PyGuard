      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgn9t9zbu0qmv/EsqUele.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution or malware installation. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration for a Python package named 'esqurlpip' with seemingly legitimate metadata, which may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities such as installing malicious packages or maintaining persistence. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and the combination of package setup with hidden payload execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
