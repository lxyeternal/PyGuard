      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely designed to perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing unauthorized connections, or other malicious activities. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a hidden window and the obfuscated command strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run a setup process that appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or part of the malicious payload. Overall, the code exhibits behavior characteristic of malware, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and potential remote control or data exfiltration capabilities.",
