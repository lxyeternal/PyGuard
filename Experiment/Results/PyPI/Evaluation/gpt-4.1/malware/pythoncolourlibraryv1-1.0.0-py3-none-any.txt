      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It performs extensive data theft activities, including stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and sensitive information from browsers and applications such as Discord, Chrome, Firefox, and Roblox. It captures screenshots, gathers system information, and exfiltrates all collected data to remote servers via webhooks and file uploads. The script also attempts to disable security measures, kill security-related processes, and persist on the victim's machine by copying itself to startup folders. Additionally, it searches for specific files related to cryptocurrency wallets, wallets, and login credentials, uploads them to anonymous file-sharing services, and reports detailed system and network information. All these behaviors are characteristic of malware designed for espionage, credential theft, and unauthorized data exfiltration.",
