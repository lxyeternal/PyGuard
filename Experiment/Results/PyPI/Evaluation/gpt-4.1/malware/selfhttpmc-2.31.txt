      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the target system, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code's presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and the lack of legitimate context for such behavior indicate malicious intent. The setup function appears to be a decoy or cover, but the core malicious activity is the hidden PowerShell command execution.",
