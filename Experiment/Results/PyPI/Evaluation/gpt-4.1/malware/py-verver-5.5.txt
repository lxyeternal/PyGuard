      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious activity. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the silent execution with no user interaction strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
