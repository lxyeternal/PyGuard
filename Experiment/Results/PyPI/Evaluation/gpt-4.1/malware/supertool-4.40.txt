      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' combined with hidden window flags indicates an attempt to run malicious code covertly. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command only if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, possibly to avoid repeated execution or detection. Overall, this behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to execute hidden or malicious PowerShell commands.",
