The embedded base64-encoded string decodes into Python code that appears to set up network requests, possibly to exfiltrate data or control the system remotely. The use of dynamic code execution (exec) with decoded payloads, combined with obfuscation techniques, strongly indicates malicious intent, aiming to hide malicious activities from casual inspection. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden malicious behaviors, including remote command execution and data exfiltration, making it malicious.",
