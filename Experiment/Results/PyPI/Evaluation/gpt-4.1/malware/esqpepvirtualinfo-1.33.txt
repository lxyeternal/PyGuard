      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload delivery. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with hidden window flags, indicating an intent to run malicious code covertly. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, possibly to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities.",
