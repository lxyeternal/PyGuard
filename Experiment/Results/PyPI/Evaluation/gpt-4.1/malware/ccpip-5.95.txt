      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and perform malicious actions without user awareness.",
