      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious intent. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and its silent execution strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence without user awareness.",
