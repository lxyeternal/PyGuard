      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The encoded command is hidden and obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors that might reveal malicious intent. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution or payload delivery.",
