      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads without user consent. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'WindowStyle Hidden' indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. Overall, this behavior strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at executing hidden, potentially harmful operations on the host system.",
