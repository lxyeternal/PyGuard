      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'EncodedCommand' parameter. The base64-encoded string decodes to a PowerShell script that likely performs malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package with misleading metadata, which may serve as a cover for malicious distribution or to evade detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated code and the use of PowerShell for potentially malicious operations indicate malicious intent.",
