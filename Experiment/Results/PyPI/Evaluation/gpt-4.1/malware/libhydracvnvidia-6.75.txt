      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the target system, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise or hide malicious activity under the guise of a benign setup script, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to evade detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution indicates malicious intent.",
