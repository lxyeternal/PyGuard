      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can prevent detection of failures or malicious activity. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or download further malicious payloads.",
