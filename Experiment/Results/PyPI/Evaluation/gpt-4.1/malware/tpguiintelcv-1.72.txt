      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious code, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of obfuscated command execution combined with silent error handling indicates malicious intent, potentially aiming to compromise the system or perform unauthorized activities.",
