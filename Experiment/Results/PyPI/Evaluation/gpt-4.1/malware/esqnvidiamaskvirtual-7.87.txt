      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell command execution that downloads and executes external code from a URL (esquelesquad.rip). This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious payloads silently in the background, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or malware installation. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise malicious activity under the guise of a benign package setup, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to evade detection.",
