      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and heavily encrypted payloads that execute arbitrary code via marshaled, base64, and hex-decoded data. It dynamically loads and executes code snippets, likely malicious, which can perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or system compromise. Additionally, it interacts with external services (e.g., Telegram, web proxies) and manipulates files and network connections, indicating intent to control or hijack the host system. The use of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network operations strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at covertly executing malicious payloads and maintaining persistence or control over the compromised environment.",
