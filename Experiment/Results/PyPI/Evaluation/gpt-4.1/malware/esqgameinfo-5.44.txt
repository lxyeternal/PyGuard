      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing remote payloads, establishing persistence, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the malicious command if the file does not exist, which can be a tactic to evade detection or re-infection. The presence of such obfuscated and conditional remote code execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
