      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden post-installation routine (_post_install) that executes during package installation. This routine performs several suspicious actions: it writes to a file named 'bykotko.txt', retrieves the attacker's external IP address, gathers system hostname and installation path information, encodes this data in base64, and then sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain (kotko.org) with the encoded data as a parameter. These behaviors indicate data exfiltration and covert tracking of the system and network information without user consent, which are characteristic of malicious activity.",
