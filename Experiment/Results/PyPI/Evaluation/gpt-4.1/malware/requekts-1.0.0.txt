      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes code fetched from an external source via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior indicates an attempt to execute remote code during installation, which is a common tactic in malicious packages to run arbitrary or harmful code on the target system. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows further suggests malicious intent, as it aims to hide the true payload and target specific environments for exploitation.",
