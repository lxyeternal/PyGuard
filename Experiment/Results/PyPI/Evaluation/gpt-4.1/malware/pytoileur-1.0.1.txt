      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload embedded within a base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed at runtime. This payload appears to import system modules and perform network or system operations that could be malicious, such as creating objects, running commands, or exfiltrating data. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and the inclusion of potentially harmful system calls strongly suggest malicious intent, likely aiming to hide malicious activities like data theft, remote control, or system compromise.",
