      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses command window display. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it enables the script to run potentially harmful commands covertly. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, which can compromise system security. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions suggests an attempt to hide or ignore errors, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, the script appears designed to execute hidden, potentially malicious PowerShell commands, making it malicious.",
