      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a Fernet-encrypted payload fetched from an embedded base64 string. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code silently during setup, which is a common tactic used in malware to execute malicious payloads without user awareness. The use of obfuscation (random class names, encrypted code, and embedded payload) further suggests malicious intent, aiming to hide malicious activities such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
