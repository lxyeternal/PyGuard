      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior suggests the code is designed to run arbitrary, potentially malicious payloads silently during setup, which can compromise the host system. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated class and variable names further indicates malicious intent to evade detection and facilitate malicious activities such as remote code execution or data exfiltration.",
