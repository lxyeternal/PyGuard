      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. The decoded payload is highly obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, but the use of `exec()` on decoded data is a common technique in malicious scripts to hide harmful actions. Such behavior suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent, such as executing hidden commands, downloading malware, or establishing unauthorized access. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate malicious activity, likely designed to evade detection and perform harmful operations on the host system.",
