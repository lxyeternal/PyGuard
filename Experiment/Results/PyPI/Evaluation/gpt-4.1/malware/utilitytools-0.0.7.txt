This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves fetching and running potentially harmful code without user consent. The executable could be malware, ransomware, or other malicious payloads, posing significant security risks. The code is embedded within a package setup script, which may be used to disguise malicious intent under the guise of a legitimate package installation.",

This behavior is characteristic of malware or malicious scripts designed to deliver and run malicious payloads on the victim's system. The URL points to a file named 'pics.exe', which is likely an arbitrary or misleading name intended to disguise its true nature. Running such an executable can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activities.",
