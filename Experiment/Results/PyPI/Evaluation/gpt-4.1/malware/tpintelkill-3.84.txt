      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially for remote control, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code's presence of a seemingly benign setup() function is likely a decoy or cover, but the core behavior of executing hidden PowerShell commands indicates malicious intent.",
