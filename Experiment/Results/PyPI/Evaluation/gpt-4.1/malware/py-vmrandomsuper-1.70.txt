      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The command is encoded in Base64, making it difficult to analyze directly, and is executed with the 'Hidden' window style and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, indicating an intent to run silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which could be a persistence or anti-analysis measure. The presence of this obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing a backdoor, or executing other harmful payloads.",
