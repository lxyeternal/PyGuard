      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -EncodedCommand' parameter. The base64-encoded string likely encodes malicious payload or commands designed to run stealthily in the background, potentially downloading, executing, or establishing unauthorized connections. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which may serve as a persistence or anti-analysis mechanism. The presence of such obfuscated execution and conditional logic strongly indicates malicious intent, aiming to hide malicious activities from detection and analysis.",
