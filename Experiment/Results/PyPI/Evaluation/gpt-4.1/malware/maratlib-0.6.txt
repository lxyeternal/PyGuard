      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that downloads a script from an external URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/aza.sh), saves it as 'gay.sh' in the /tmp directory, sets its permissions to executable (777), and then executes it via bash. This behavior indicates an attempt to run potentially malicious remote code without user consent, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities. Additionally, the code contains obfuscated functions that decode and evaluate strings, likely used to hide malicious payloads or behavior, further indicating malicious intent.",
