      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function and module names using encoded strings and character mappings, which is typical of malware or malicious scripts attempting to evade detection. Specifically, it attempts to import 'pip' and install or execute modules or commands, and later uses 'win32com' and 'Dispatch' to potentially execute system-level operations such as creating shortcuts, accessing environment variables, or manipulating files and directories. The presence of obfuscation, dynamic imports, and system modifications strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing unauthorized actions, possibly including privilege escalation, persistence, or data exfiltration.",
