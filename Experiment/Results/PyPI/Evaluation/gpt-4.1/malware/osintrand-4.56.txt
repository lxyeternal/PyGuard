      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently, bypassing user detection. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as such techniques are commonly used in malware to evade detection and compromise systems.",
