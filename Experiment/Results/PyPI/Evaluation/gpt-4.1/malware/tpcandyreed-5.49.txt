      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise or hide malicious activity, especially given the use of encoded commands and hidden window flags. The presence of such obfuscated execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
