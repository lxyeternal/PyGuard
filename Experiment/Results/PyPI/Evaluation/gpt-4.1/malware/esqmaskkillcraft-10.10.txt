      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears benign on the surface, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or compromising the system. Overall, the script exhibits behavior typical of malware, including obfuscated command execution and stealthy operation.",
