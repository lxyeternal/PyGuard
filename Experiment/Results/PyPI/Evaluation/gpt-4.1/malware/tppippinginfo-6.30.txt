      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise or hide malicious activity by using obfuscation and minimal visible actions, such as creating a seemingly legitimate Python package setup. Overall, the presence of hidden PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
