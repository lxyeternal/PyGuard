This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as remote code execution, malware download, or backdoor installation. The URL used appears to be a Discord CDN link, which is commonly exploited for hosting malicious payloads. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function related to the rest of the script, which appears to be unrelated utility functions for plotting mathematical functions. The presence of code that silently downloads and executes external code without user consent or validation indicates malicious intent.",
