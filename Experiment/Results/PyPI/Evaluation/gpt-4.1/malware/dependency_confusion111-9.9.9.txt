      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden mechanism that performs covert DNS queries to specific subdomains constructed from encoded JSON data. This data includes the hostname, username, current working directory, and a package name. The DNS requests are sent to a controlled domain ('uchpuchmak.lol') via DNS over UDP, with the data encoded in the subdomain labels. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration or command-and-control communication, which is typical in malicious malware or backdoors. Although the package claims to be for research purposes, the embedded DNS exfiltration logic indicates malicious intent or at least malicious capabilities.",
