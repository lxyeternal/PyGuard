      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted string, which is likely to be malicious. This behavior enables remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The obfuscation of class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and the conditional execution on Windows are common tactics in malicious Python scripts to evade detection and target specific environments.",
