      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Overall, the presence of obfuscated command execution indicates malicious behavior.",
