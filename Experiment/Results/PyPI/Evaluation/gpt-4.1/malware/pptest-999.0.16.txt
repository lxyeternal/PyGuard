      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information and the public IP address through covert DNS queries. It constructs a payload containing hostname, current working directory, WAN IP, and local IPs, then encodes and splits this payload into DNS subdomain queries to a controlled domain (burpcollaborator.net). This technique is commonly used for data exfiltration in covert channels. Additionally, the code appears to be embedded within a setup script, which may be used to disguise its malicious intent under the guise of a legitimate package installation. The presence of such data exfiltration mechanisms indicates malicious intent aimed at stealthily collecting and transmitting sensitive system information.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a covert data exfiltration mechanism using DNS queries. It constructs a payload containing system information such as hostname, current working directory, WAN IP address, and local IP addresses. This payload is then hashed and encoded into a hexadecimal string, which is segmented and sent as DNS A record queries to a domain controlled by an attacker (fake_domain: 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net'). This technique allows an attacker to stealthily extract sensitive system information by observing DNS traffic, which is less suspicious than direct network connections. The presence of a hardcoded domain, encoding of system info, and use of DNS queries for data exfiltration are classic indicators of malicious behavior, often associated with data theft or command-and-control communication.",
