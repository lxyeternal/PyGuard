      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized connections, or other harmful actions. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially executed without user awareness, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window), further suggesting malicious behavior. The setup function appears benign and may be used to mask or distract from the malicious activity.",
