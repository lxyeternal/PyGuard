      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing remote payloads, establishing persistence, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly legitimate Python package setup, which may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious intent. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the package setup indicates malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious payloads covertly.",
