Additionally, it executes an external command 'pydefender' via subprocess, which may be a tool for malware detection or other purposes. The combination of notifying an external server upon installation and executing potentially sensitive commands suggests malicious intent, such as covertly monitoring or controlling the environment without user consent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and appears to be designed to execute hidden or malicious payloads. It decodes multiple base64-encoded strings, which likely contain malicious commands or scripts, and then dynamically executes or processes them. The use of eval, decode, and base64 decoding, combined with the obfuscation, suggests an intent to conceal malicious activities such as executing arbitrary code, downloading or executing malware, or exfiltrating data. Overall, this code exhibits typical characteristics of malicious scripts intended to evade detection and perform harmful actions.",
