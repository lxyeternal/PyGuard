      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes code fetched from an external source using the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior indicates remote code execution, which is a common tactic in malware to run arbitrary malicious payloads. The use of encrypted payloads and the conditional execution only on Windows further suggests an intent to hide malicious activities and target specific environments. Overall, this code is designed to download and execute potentially harmful code from an external server, making it malicious.",
