      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the 'install' command to execute a decryption and execution of potentially malicious code during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it decrypts a hardcoded Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it via 'exec', which can run arbitrary malicious code. This behavior is hidden within the setup script, making it likely intended for malicious purposes such as remote code execution, malware deployment, or backdooring the system during package installation.",
