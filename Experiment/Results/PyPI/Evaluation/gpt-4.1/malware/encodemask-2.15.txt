      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given its obfuscated nature. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide failures or malicious activities. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with silent error handling strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions without user awareness.",
