      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code using Fernet encryption. Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts a payload, and executes it dynamically via 'exec'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run hidden, potentially harmful code during package installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to execute arbitrary code without user awareness. The obfuscation of variable names and the embedded encrypted payload further suggest malicious intent.",
