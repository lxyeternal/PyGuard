      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden post-installation routine (_post_install) that executes during package installation. This routine performs several suspicious actions: it writes a proof message to a local file ('pocbykotko.txt'), retrieves the attacker's external IP address, encodes it along with the hostname and installation path into a base64 string, and then sends this encoded data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('https://kotko.org') with custom query parameters. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system information to an external server, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at tracking or compromising the user system without consent.",
