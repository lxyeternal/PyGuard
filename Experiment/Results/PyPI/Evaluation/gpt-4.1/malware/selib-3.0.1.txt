      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using the exec() function. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious activities such as downloading additional malware, establishing backdoors, or executing harmful commands. The embedded base64 string, once decoded, imports modules like 'tempfile', 'sys', and 'urllib.request', and performs network requests to URLs (e.g., 'https://pst.klgtrg.io/paste/hzzzp/r') which could be malicious endpoints. The code's primary purpose appears to be to execute hidden, potentially harmful code at runtime, making it malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an embedded obfuscated payload that decodes and executes a base64-encoded string, which likely contains malicious code. This payload is hidden within a complex import statement and uses dynamic code execution functions (`exec` and `compile`) to run arbitrary code at runtime. Such behavior indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. Additionally, the code includes functions for terminal manipulation, color effects, and animations, which may be used to mask or distract from the malicious payload. Overall, the presence of hidden code execution mechanisms and obfuscation strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
