This behavior indicates an attempt to fetch and execute remote malicious scripts or commands, which is a common tactic for remote code execution or backdooring. The malicious payload is triggered during the installation process via the 'install' command class, making it likely to execute automatically when the package is installed. Overall, this code is designed to perform malicious remote code execution during package installation, constituting malicious behavior.",
