      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
