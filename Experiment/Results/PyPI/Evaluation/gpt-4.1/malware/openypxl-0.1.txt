      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing code based on environment variables, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor behavior. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and environment checks strongly suggests malicious intent aimed at covertly installing or executing harmful payloads, possibly with administrative privileges. The presence of code that interacts with system components (like creating shortcuts, checking admin rights, and manipulating files) indicates potential malicious activity such as persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.",
