      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class 'GruppeInstall' that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code using the 'fernet' library. This behavior is hidden within the 'run' method and is triggered during package installation, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code silently. The embedded encrypted payload, once decrypted, is executed via 'exec', which can be used to run malicious scripts, establish backdoors, or perform other harmful actions. Overall, this code is designed to surreptitiously execute malicious payloads during installation, indicating clear malicious intent.",
