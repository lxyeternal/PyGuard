      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious code, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of obfuscated command execution and silent failure handling strongly indicates malicious intent.",
