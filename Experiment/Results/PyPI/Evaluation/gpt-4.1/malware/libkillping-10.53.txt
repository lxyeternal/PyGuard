      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially for purposes such as remote control, data exfiltration, or executing further malware. Additionally, the code's presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution indicates malicious intent, despite the seemingly benign setup() call. Overall, the script exhibits typical characteristics of malicious code designed to evade detection and execute harmful actions.",
