      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, which may serve as a decoy or to blend malicious activity with legitimate package installation. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with a base64-encoded PowerShell command indicates an attempt to execute potentially harmful actions covertly, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or compromising the system. Overall, this behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts aiming to evade detection and perform unauthorized operations.",
