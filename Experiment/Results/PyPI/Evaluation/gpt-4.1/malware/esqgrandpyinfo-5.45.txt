      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run potentially harmful code silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, indicating an evasive tactic to avoid detection or to trigger malicious activity under certain conditions. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional triggers strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, backdoors, or other harmful actions.",
