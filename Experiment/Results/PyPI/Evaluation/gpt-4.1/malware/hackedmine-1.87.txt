      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly legitimate Python package setup, which may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities such as installing backdoors or malware. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution and package setup indicates malicious intent, potentially aiming to compromise the system or deliver payloads covertly.",
