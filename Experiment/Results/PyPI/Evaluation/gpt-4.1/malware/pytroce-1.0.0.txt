      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently run malicious code during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. The obfuscation and conditional execution on Windows further suggest malicious intent to evade detection and target specific environments.",
