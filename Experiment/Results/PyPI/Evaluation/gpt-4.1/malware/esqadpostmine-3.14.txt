      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with the window hidden, indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the payload, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or run only under certain conditions. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional logic strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, malware download, or persistence.",
