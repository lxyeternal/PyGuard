      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flags, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The specific base64-encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source. Additionally, the code includes a setup function that appears legitimate but is wrapped in a try-except block, possibly to avoid detection or errors if dependencies are missing. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with silent process creation strongly suggests malicious intent, such as malware download, remote code execution, or persistence mechanisms.",
