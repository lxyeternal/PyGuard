      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload, when decoded, likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads without user awareness. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' indicates an attempt to run malicious code stealthily. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used as a cover for malicious distribution or to evade detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and hidden subprocess calls strongly suggests malicious intent.",
