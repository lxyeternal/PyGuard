      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears intentionally designed to hide malicious behavior. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses dynamic import of 'pip' and 'win32com' modules, and attempts to create shortcuts, access environment variables, and manipulate files or system resources in a way that suggests malicious intent such as installing packages, escalating privileges, or executing payloads covertly. The presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system modifications strongly indicates malicious activity aimed at compromising the system or executing hidden malicious operations.",
