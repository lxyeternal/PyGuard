This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run covertly on the victim's machine, potentially downloading or executing harmful scripts or malware. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a hidden window and the obfuscated command strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to evade detection and execute malicious actions without user awareness.",
