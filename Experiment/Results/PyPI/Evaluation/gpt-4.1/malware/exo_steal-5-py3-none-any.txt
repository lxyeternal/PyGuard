      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'exo-steal_file', which by its name suggests it is designed to steal files or data. Additionally, the code initializes the 'colorama' library, which is often used for terminal text styling. The combination of importing a module with 'steal' in its name and minimal other code strongly indicates malicious intent, likely aimed at exfiltrating files or sensitive data from the system. The code appears to be part of a malicious payload intended to covertly steal files.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to surreptitiously collect sensitive user data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet, including configuration files, seed phrases, passphrases, and wallet storage data. It captures a screenshot of the user's desktop, compresses these files into a ZIP archive, and then exfiltrates the archive along with the screenshot, IP address, and geolocation information via Telegram messages. This behavior indicates an intent to steal private wallet information and personal data without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as credential theft and privacy invasion.",
