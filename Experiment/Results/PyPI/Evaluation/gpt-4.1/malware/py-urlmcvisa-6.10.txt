      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run covertly on the system, potentially downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a long, encoded string and the attempt to run it silently (hidden window, no window) strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to perform a setup operation that appears legitimate but may be a cover for malicious activity or a decoy. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and hidden subprocess invocation indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing malicious code covertly.",
