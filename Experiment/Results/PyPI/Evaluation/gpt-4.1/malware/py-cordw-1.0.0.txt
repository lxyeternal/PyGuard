      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious payloads using Fernet encryption. Specifically, it decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext, then executes the resulting code with exec(). This behavior indicates an attempt to run malicious code stealthily during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. The obfuscation through encrypted payloads and the conditional execution on Windows strongly suggest malicious intent.",
