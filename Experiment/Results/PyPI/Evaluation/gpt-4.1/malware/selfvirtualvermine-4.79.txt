      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious payload designed to run arbitrary code or download/execute malicious content without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which may serve as a cover for malicious activity or to facilitate further malicious operations. The use of try-except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to hide malicious actions. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malware, such as obfuscated command execution and concealment, indicating it is malicious.",
