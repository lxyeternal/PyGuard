      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware distribution or backdoor installation. The use of encrypted payloads and the obfuscation of the malicious logic strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to evade detection and execute malicious code without user awareness.",
