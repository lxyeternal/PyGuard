      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads, establish remote access, or perform other malicious activities. The presence of such obfuscated command execution, especially when combined with the check for a specific file ('tahg') and the silent execution, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run potentially harmful code without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.",
