It collects these files from the user's Steam installation directory, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and then uploads this archive to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it aims to secretly gather and transmit potentially sensitive information without user consent, which could be used for account hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious activities.",

If found, it copies this directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a ZIP file, and then uploads this ZIP file to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, as it secretly collects potentially sensitive user data stored in the 'Exodus' directory and transmits it to an attacker-controlled server. The use of base64 encoding for the URL and the silent deletion of local copies further suggest malicious intent to avoid detection and cover tracks.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes, primarily to steal sensitive user data. It imports modules with names suggesting access to passwords, cookies, tokens, and other private information (e.g., 'passwords_cards_cookies', 'find_tokens', 'machineinfo', 'screenshot', 'telegram', 'metamask', 'discord', 'exodus'). The functions invoked (such as 'find_tokens', 'machineinfo', 'sikrinsat', 'telegram') imply activities like extracting stored credentials, capturing screenshots, and possibly interacting with messaging platforms to exfiltrate data. The use of try-except blocks around these functions suggests an attempt to silently execute multiple data-stealing routines without crashing, which is characteristic of malware designed to harvest user data covertly.",

It searches specific directories for stored data files, scans them for patterns matching Discord tokens, and then exfiltrates any found tokens by sending them via an HTTP POST request to a remote server (whose URL is base64-decoded within the code).

It attempts to copy these directories to a temporary location, archive them into a ZIP file, and then upload the archive to a remote server via an HTTP POST request.

The presence of a base64-encoded URL, which is decoded and used as a webhook, further suggests an attempt to obfuscate the malicious activity.
