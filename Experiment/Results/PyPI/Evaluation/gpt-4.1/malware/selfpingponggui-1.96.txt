      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as suggested by the URL 'cdn.discordapp.com/attachs/103168671742351312/1079749475145048/EsqueleSquad.exe'), which could lead to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code includes a setup function that appears legitimate but is wrapped in a try-except block, possibly to avoid detection or errors if the setup fails. Overall, the presence of silent, encoded PowerShell execution targeting external resources strongly indicates malicious intent.",
