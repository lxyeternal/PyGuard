      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an embedded base64-encoded payload that, when decoded and executed, likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing additional malicious code, or establishing unauthorized network connections. The presence of obfuscated code and the use of exec with decoded data strongly suggest an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. The payload is only executed if the script is not run with the 'sdist' argument, indicating an intent to run hidden or malicious operations during normal execution, potentially to compromise the system, exfiltrate data, or establish persistence. Overall, this code is designed to execute malicious activities covertly, making it malicious.",
