This request is triggered during the installation or development setup process, meaning that simply installing or developing the package causes the malicious code to execute. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors designed to exfiltrate data, establish unauthorized communication, or perform other malicious activities without user consent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command further indicates malicious intent.",
