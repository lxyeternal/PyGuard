      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `notmalfunc()` that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via `os.system()`. This pattern is commonly used to hide malicious commands or payloads. The `notmalfunc()` function is invoked during the installation process (`AfterInstall.run()`), meaning that when the package is installed via pip, it will execute arbitrary code embedded in the base64 string. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to run harmful commands, download malware, or perform other malicious activities without user consent. The rest of the code appears to be a standard setup script, but the presence of the obfuscated execution function and its invocation during installation confirms malicious behavior.",
