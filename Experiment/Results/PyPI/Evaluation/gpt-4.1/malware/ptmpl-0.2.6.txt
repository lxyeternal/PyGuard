      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden behavior within the custom 'install' command class 'GruppeInstall'. During installation, it performs an HTTP GET request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' and prints the response. This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to gather system or network information without user consent, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. Additionally, the code includes commented-out decryption logic and references to potentially malicious modules (e.g., Fernet), indicating an intent to obfuscate or execute malicious payloads. The presence of such network activity during installation, especially when hidden behind a custom install command, suggests malicious intent to spy on or fingerprint the environment, making this code malicious.",
