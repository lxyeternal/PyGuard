      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run covertly on the target system. The script also attempts to perform a seemingly benign setup operation, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell invocation indicates an attempt to execute malicious actions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a base64 string is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute malicious scripts silently.",
