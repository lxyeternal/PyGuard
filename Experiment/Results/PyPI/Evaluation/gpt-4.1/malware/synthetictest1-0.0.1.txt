      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL ('https://stub.syntheticcc.repl.co/exo.exe') and executes it with elevated or hidden privileges by setting an environment variable and starting the process. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code on the victim's machine without user consent or knowledge. The use of a hardcoded URL and automatic execution of the downloaded file are classic indicators of malicious activity, such as installing malware, remote access trojans, or other harmful payloads.",
