      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function and module names using encoded strings and character mappings, which is a common obfuscation technique. Notably, it attempts to import 'pip' and install or execute commands conditionally, and later on, it uses 'win32com' and 'os' modules to create shortcuts, access environment variables, and manipulate files or directories. The presence of such obfuscated code, combined with dynamic imports and file operations, strongly suggests malicious behavior such as installing malware, creating backdoors, or executing harmful payloads under the guise of legitimate package setup. The final 'setup' call with a suspicious package name ('dsicord-webhook') further indicates an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package while executing malicious actions.",
