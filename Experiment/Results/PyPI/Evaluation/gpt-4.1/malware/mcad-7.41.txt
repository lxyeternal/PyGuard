      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is a common technique for obfuscating malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, and the use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' suggests an attempt to run hidden, obfuscated code without user awareness. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. Overall, these behaviors indicate malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions.",
