      "malicious_behavior": "The code is obfuscated and decodes a base64-encoded string that, when executed, likely performs malicious actions such as executing arbitrary code, potentially downloading or executing malware, or exfiltrating data. The use of `exec` on decoded data is a common technique in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. Without executing the code, the structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to conceal its behavior and execute potentially harmful payloads.",
