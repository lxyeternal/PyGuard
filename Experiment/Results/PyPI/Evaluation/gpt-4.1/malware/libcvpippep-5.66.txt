      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise or hide malicious activity under the guise of a benign setup script, which is a common tactic in malware. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the silent execution (with 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW') strongly indicates malicious intent.",
