      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded, making it difficult to analyze directly, but this obfuscation is a common tactic used by malware to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, which could be a way to avoid detection or to ensure the payload runs only under certain conditions. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious behavior, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions.",
