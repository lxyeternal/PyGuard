      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious behavior embedded within the custom installation process. Specifically, during the installation (via the 'install' command), it executes the '_post_install' function which performs the following actions: 1. Creates or appends to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a proof message. 2. Retrieves the attacker's external IP address by making a GET request to 'https://api.ipify.org'. 3. Gathers system hostname and current script directory path. 4. Encodes this information in base64 format. 5. Sends this encoded data via a GET request to an external domain ('https://kotko.org') with a URL parameter. This behavior effectively exfiltrates sensitive system information (public IP, hostname, installation path) to an external server without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data theft or reconnaissance. The code is designed to execute during package installation, making it a supply-chain attack vector or a backdoor mechanism.",
