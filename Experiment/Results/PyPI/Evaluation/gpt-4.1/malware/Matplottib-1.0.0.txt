      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload embedded within the script. Specifically, it uses the Fernet encryption scheme to decrypt a hardcoded encrypted string and then executes the resulting code via `exec()`. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code because it hides its true intent, executes potentially harmful code, and relies on obfuscation techniques. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during installation strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, malware, or other malicious components without user awareness.",
