      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other malicious actions. The encoded command is hidden and obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique in malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration for a Python package named 'killrand', which appears legitimate but could be a decoy or cover for malicious activity. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
