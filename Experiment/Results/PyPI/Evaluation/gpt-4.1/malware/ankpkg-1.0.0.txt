It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves surreptitious data exfiltration without user consent, potentially enabling tracking, fingerprinting, or further malicious actions. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function with this data, indicating malicious intent.",
