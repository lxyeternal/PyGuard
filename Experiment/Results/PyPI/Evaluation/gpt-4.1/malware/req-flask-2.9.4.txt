      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an embedded base64-encoded payload that, when decoded and executed, imports the 'os' and 'requests' modules, then makes an HTTP GET request to a specific URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/110946518843936425/Windows.exe). It then writes the response content to a temporary file and executes it via subprocess. This behavior indicates an attempt to download and run a potentially malicious executable from an external server, which is a common tactic used in malware distribution and remote code execution attacks. The presence of such obfuscated code and the act of fetching and executing external code strongly suggest malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from an external URL and then executes it without any validation or user consent. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to deliver malware, ransomware, or other harmful payloads onto the victim's system. Running an external executable directly poses significant security risks, especially when the source is untrusted, making this code highly suspicious and malicious.",
