      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL in the base64-encoded string). Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities, such as installing malicious packages or maintaining persistence. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the suspicious URL strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or exfiltrating data.",
