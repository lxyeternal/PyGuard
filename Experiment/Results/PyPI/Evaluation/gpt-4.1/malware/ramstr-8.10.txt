      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to run hidden commands without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious scripts.",
