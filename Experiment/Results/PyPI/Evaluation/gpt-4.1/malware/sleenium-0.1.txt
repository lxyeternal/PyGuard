      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it uses the 'pip.main()' function to install packages, which is deprecated and potentially dangerous, and it manipulates system files and environment variables. Additionally, it creates shortcuts and interacts with system directories, potentially executing or installing malicious payloads. The overall structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at covertly installing or executing harmful code, possibly to compromise the system or exfiltrate data.",
