      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or commands that could compromise the system, such as downloading or executing malicious files, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the malicious PowerShell command, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or control execution flow. The presence of such obfuscated and hidden command execution indicates malicious intent and behavior.",
