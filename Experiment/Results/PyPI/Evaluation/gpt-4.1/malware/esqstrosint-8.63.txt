      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run potentially harmful code silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code conditionally executes this command if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, indicating an anti-analysis or persistence mechanism. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional triggers strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing backdoors, or performing other malicious activities without user consent.",
