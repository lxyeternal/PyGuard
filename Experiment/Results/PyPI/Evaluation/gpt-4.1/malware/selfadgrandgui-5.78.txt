      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package named 'selfadgrandgui' with potentially malicious intent, such as installing or disguising malicious modules under the guise of legitimate package metadata. The combination of silent PowerShell execution and package setup suggests an attempt to establish persistence, download additional payloads, or perform other malicious activities on the host system.",
