      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to escalate privileges to administrator level on Windows systems without user consent, which is suspicious. It then downloads a file from a remote server, saves it as 'image.png', and executes its contents after decoding from base64. This behavior indicates remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to run arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine. The use of privilege escalation, remote code download, and execution are classic indicators of malicious activity, such as malware or backdoor installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches a script from a remote server and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows the remote server to run arbitrary code on the client machine, which can lead to various malicious activities such as data theft, system compromise, or installing malware. The use of a non-standard URL and custom headers further suggests an attempt to obfuscate or hide the malicious intent. Overall, this code is malicious as it executes external code without any validation or safeguards.",
