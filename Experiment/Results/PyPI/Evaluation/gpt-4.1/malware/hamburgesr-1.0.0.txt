      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds a base64-encoded URL that, when the package is installed (`pip install`), decodes and executes a system command to perform an HTTP request to `http://localhost/rev.sh`. This behavior suggests an attempt to contact a remote server, potentially for malicious purposes such as retrieving further payloads, exfiltrating data, or establishing a reverse shell. The use of base64 encoding obscures this activity, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to evade detection. Additionally, the code is integrated into the installation process via custom `install` and `develop` commands, ensuring the malicious action executes during package setup, further indicating malicious intent.",
