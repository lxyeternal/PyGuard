      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes hidden code embedded within the script. Specifically, it uses the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme to decrypt a payload and then executes it via `exec()`. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code, as it attempts to conceal its true intent and execute arbitrary code during installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or other malicious activities. The presence of encrypted payloads and the use of `exec()` on decrypted data are common indicators of malicious intent.",
