      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads silently. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly legitimate Python package setup, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware installation. The obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious behavior designed to evade detection and compromise the system.",
