It then attempts to send this data via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external URL ('https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...'). The behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code's purpose appears to be to stealthily gather and transmit system details, possibly for malicious reconnaissance or control.",
