      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic involving dynamic string construction, nested loops, conditional statements, and the use of obscure variable names. It performs multiple actions that suggest malicious intent, such as attempting to install or invoke system-level modules (e.g., 'pip', 'win32com', 'ctypes', 'os'), creating shortcuts, manipulating environment variables, and walking through directory structures. The extensive use of convoluted expressions and encoded strings indicates an effort to hide malicious behavior, likely to evade detection. The final setup configuration with a suspicious package name 'weboscket-client' (misspelled 'websocket-client') further suggests malicious intent, possibly to masquerade as a legitimate package while executing harmful operations in the background. Overall, the code appears designed to perform malicious activities such as privilege escalation, persistence, or system compromise.",
