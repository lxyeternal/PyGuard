      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The specific PowerShell command is encoded in base64, making it difficult to analyze directly, but such obfuscation is typical of malicious scripts aiming to download, install, or execute malicious payloads, or establish persistence. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful or legitimate setup operations, and the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command strongly suggests malicious intent.",
