      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given the obfuscation and use of hidden execution. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious intent or facilitate further malicious activities under the guise of a legitimate package. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution and the potential for malicious payload delivery indicates malicious behavior.",
