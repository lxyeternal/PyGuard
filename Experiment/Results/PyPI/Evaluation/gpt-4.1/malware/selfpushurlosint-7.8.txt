      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to download or execute additional payloads from external sources (e.g., the URL embedded in the encoded command). The presence of this behavior, especially combined with the obfuscation and the check for a specific file ('tahg') to trigger the payload, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run potentially harmful commands without user awareness, which is characteristic of malware or backdoor activity.",
