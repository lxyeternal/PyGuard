      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) and potentially perform harmful actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of obfuscated commands and hidden execution strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be covertly executing malicious code rather than legitimate setup or package management, which is suspicious in this context.",
