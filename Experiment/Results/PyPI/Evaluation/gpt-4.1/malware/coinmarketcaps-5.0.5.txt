      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs malicious activities by retrieving and executing a potentially harmful executable from an external URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') during installation. It also sends the system's 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable to an external server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation <COMPUTERNAME>'). This behavior indicates an attempt to infect the host system with malware, exfiltrate system information, and potentially compromise security. The use of 'os.system' to run a downloaded executable further confirms malicious intent, as it could lead to remote code execution or installation of malware.",
