      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing reverse shells, or other harmful actions. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' combined with hidden window flags indicates an attempt to run malicious code covertly. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to execute this hidden command without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.",
