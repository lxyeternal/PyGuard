      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' suggests obfuscation to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only then executes the payload, which could be a way to avoid repeated execution or to target specific environments. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as legitimate software rarely uses such techniques without clear purpose.",
