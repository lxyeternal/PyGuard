      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that overrides the 'install' command during package setup. Within its 'run' method, it conditionally executes malicious payloads on Windows systems ('os.name == \"nt\"'). Specifically, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted string, which is likely malicious payload. This behavior enables remote code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code, install backdoors, or perform other malicious activities on the target system. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads are typical techniques used to hide malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to surreptitiously execute malicious code during package installation, indicating clear malicious behavior.",
