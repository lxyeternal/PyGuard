      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing harmful payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration for a Python package named 'selfstudycontrolpush' with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious activity as legitimate software distribution. The combination of obfuscated command execution and deceptive package setup indicates malicious intent, potentially aimed at compromising the host system or maintaining covert access.",
