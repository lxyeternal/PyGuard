      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, as indicated by the presence of a hidden window and the use of PowerShell's encoded command feature. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, potentially to avoid repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional logic to hide malicious activity strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing harmful scripts.",
