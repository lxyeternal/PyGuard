      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious activity. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution indicates an intent to perform malicious actions such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence on the target system without detection.",
