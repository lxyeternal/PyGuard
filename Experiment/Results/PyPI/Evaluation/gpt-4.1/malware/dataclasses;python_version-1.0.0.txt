This exfiltration of user environment data without user consent indicates malicious intent, potentially for tracking, reconnaissance, or further exploitation. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks with this request, and the data collection is hidden within the package installation process, which is a common tactic used in malicious or maliciously-inclined Python packages.",
