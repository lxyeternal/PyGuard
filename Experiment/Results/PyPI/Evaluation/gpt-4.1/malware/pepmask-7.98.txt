      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given the obfuscated nature of the command. Additionally, the code silently ignores exceptions, which can hide failures or malicious activity. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially used for remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
