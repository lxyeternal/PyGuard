      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, which can compromise system security. Additionally, the code's obfuscation and use of hidden PowerShell execution are common tactics in malware to evade detection and maintain persistence. The presence of such behavior indicates malicious intent.",
