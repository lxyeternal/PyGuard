      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and encrypted behavior designed to conceal its true purpose. It dynamically constructs and executes code through multiple layers of encoding, decoding, and obfuscation techniques, including base64, zlib compression, and character code manipulations. The presence of a long, seemingly random string and the use of eval() to execute dynamically generated code strongly suggest malicious intent. Such techniques are commonly used to hide malware, backdoors, or other harmful payloads, making this code highly suspicious and likely malicious. Its purpose appears to be to execute hidden or malicious code without detection, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or remote control.",
