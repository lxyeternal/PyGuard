      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several malicious actions: it downloads and executes a file from an external URL, which is likely malware, and then attempts to run it using the system's executable. Additionally, it overwrites a specific Python module file with content fetched from another URL, potentially injecting malicious code into the environment. These behaviors indicate an intent to compromise the system, execute arbitrary code, and possibly maintain persistence or further malicious activities. Overall, the script exhibits typical characteristics of malware, including remote code execution and file manipulation for malicious purposes.",
