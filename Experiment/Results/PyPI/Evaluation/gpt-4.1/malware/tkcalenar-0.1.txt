      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs and executes code using functions like `pip.main()`, `os.getenv()`, `os.makedirs()`, `os.path.expanduser()`, `os.path.basename()`, and `os.path.exists()`. These operations suggest the code is attempting to download, install, or execute malicious payloads, possibly by fetching files from remote sources or manipulating the filesystem. The use of dynamic string assembly with `getattr()` and `map()` over obfuscated character codes indicates an attempt to evade static detection. Overall, the code's structure and behavior strongly imply malicious activity, such as remote code execution, privilege escalation, or malware installation.",
