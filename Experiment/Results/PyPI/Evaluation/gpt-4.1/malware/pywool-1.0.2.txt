      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decodes and executes hidden code at runtime. Specifically, it uses XOR decryption on an encrypted string to produce executable Python code, which is then run via eval(compile(...)). This pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to conceal their true intent, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution, remote command execution, or other malicious activities. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to evade static detection and analysis.",
