      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated and intentionally complex 'exec' statement that constructs and executes a large, convoluted string of code. The string is generated through a series of nested 'map', 'chr', 'int', and 'float' conversions on highly obfuscated, meaningless data. This pattern is characteristic of malicious or maliciously hidden code designed to evade detection and conceal its true purpose. The use of 'exec' to run dynamically constructed code is a common tactic in malware to execute hidden payloads, backdoors, or other malicious behaviors. Additionally, the code's primary function appears to be to disguise malicious intent behind a seemingly legitimate 'setup' call, which is a common tactic to hide malicious code within package installation scripts. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, aiming to execute hidden, obfuscated payloads or commands.",
