      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity. It attempts to gather sensitive system information such as AWS EC2 instance metadata (including IAM role credentials), hostname, current working directory, username, and IP address. It then collects environment variables and SSH directory contents, potentially to identify sensitive data or configurations. The script writes this information to a file, uploads it to external servers via HTTP POST requests, and performs DNS queries with obfuscated data. The use of random filenames, data exfiltration to external servers, and obfuscation techniques strongly suggest malicious intent, likely for reconnaissance, data theft, or command-and-control communication. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect and transmit sensitive system information to external entities, which is characteristic of malicious malware or spyware.",
