      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command is likely obfuscated to evade detection. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide errors and hinder analysis. The presence of this behavior, combined with the obfuscated PowerShell command, indicates malicious intent, potentially to download or execute malicious code without user awareness.",
