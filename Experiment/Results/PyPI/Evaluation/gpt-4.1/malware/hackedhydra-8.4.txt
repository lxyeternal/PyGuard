      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' suggests obfuscation, which is commonly employed to hide malicious activities such as downloading, executing, or establishing backdoors. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can prevent detection and debugging. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command indicates malicious intent, likely aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence without user consent.",
