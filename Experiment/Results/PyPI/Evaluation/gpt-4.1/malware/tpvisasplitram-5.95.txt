      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution. The PowerShell command is likely designed to download or execute malicious content from an external source, as indicated by the URL in the encoded string ('//dl.droppbx.com/s/sgnyq9zbu0qmv/Esqeule.exe'). Furthermore, the code includes a setup() call that appears legitimate but is likely used as a decoy or to blend malicious activity with legitimate package setup routines. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, conditional execution based on file presence, and the context suggest this code is malicious, aiming to download or execute harmful payloads silently.",
