      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zbu0qmv/ESQEule.exe'), potentially installing malware or establishing unauthorized access. Additionally, the code creates a Python package setup script that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious distribution. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the external URL strongly suggests malicious intent.",
