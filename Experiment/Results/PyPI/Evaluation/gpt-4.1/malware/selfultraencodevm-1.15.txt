      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious activity. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Overall, the code exhibits behavior typical of malware or malicious scripts.",
