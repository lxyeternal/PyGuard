      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. This behavior suggests the code is designed to perform malicious activities such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence of malicious payloads. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise or hide malicious actions behind seemingly benign package setup routines, which is a common tactic in malicious Python scripts to evade detection.",
