      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized activity on the system without user awareness. Additionally, the code's presence of a seemingly benign setup() function may be a decoy or cover for the malicious subprocess execution. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and hidden process creation indicates malicious intent.",
