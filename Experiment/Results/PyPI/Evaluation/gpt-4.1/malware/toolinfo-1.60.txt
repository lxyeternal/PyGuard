      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download, execute, or perform other malicious activities without user awareness. Additionally, the code silently ignores exceptions, which can hide failures and make detection more difficult. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common technique used in malware to evade detection and perform malicious actions covertly.",
