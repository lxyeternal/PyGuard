      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for the malicious activity. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command, especially with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and the use of 'EncodedCommand', strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Overall, this code exhibits behavior typical of malware or backdoor activity.",
