      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is a common technique for obfuscating malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command is likely designed to run malicious scripts or malware silently in the background (hidden window), potentially compromising the system. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions suggests an attempt to conceal errors or avoid detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution indicates malicious intent, especially since it triggers only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which could be a trigger for malicious payload deployment.",
