      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is a common technique for obfuscating malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, and the use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' indicates an attempt to run hidden, obfuscated code. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which could be a method to avoid re-execution or detection. Overall, these behaviors suggest the code is designed to perform malicious actions, such as downloading, executing, or maintaining persistence of malicious payloads, making it malicious.",
