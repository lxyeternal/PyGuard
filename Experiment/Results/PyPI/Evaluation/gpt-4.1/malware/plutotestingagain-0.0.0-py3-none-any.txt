      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer (trojan) designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers, Discord, and other applications. It performs the following harmful activities:\n\n- Collects and decrypts stored passwords, cookies, and tokens from popular browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) by accessing their local storage and encrypted data, then decrypts them using Windows Data Protection API and AES decryption.\n- Extracts Discord tokens, user information, billing details, and friend lists by querying Discord's local files and API endpoints.\n- Harvests browser session tokens, email addresses, phone numbers, and other personal data.\n- Searches user directories for files containing passwords, account info, or sensitive data, then uploads these files to file hosting services.\n- Collects and zips files related to cryptocurrency wallets, gaming accounts, and other sensitive applications, then uploads these archives.\n- Sends all gathered data to a remote webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating user credentials, tokens, cookies, and personal files.\n\nOverall, the code is a comprehensive info-stealer targeting multiple applications and data sources, with the intent to compromise user privacy and security.",
