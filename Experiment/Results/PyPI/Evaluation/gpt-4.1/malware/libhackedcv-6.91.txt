      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. The presence of the URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' as a comment suggests an association with malicious activity or a command-and-control server. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this payload if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution. The overall behavior indicates an attempt to execute hidden, potentially harmful code, which classifies it as malicious.",
