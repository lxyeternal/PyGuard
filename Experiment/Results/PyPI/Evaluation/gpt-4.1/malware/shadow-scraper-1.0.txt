      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious credential stealer and information extractor designed to harvest sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n- Extracts Discord tokens, user information, friends list, server memberships, billing info, and Nitro status, then sends this data to a Discord webhook.\n- Retrieves cookies, saved passwords, and other sensitive data from browsers like Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and from specific applications such as Roblox, Steam, Exodus, and Atomic Wallet.\n- Downloads and zips files from user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Videos) and from specific application folders, then uploads these archives to anonymous file hosting services.\n- Collects and exfiltrates Steam account info, Roblox account details, and Steam wallet info.\n- Uses threading to perform concurrent data collection, making it more efficient.\n- The code is obfuscated in parts, uses exec calls, and installs dependencies dynamically, indicating an attempt to evade detection.\n\nOverall, this script is designed to stealthily steal a wide range of personal and financial information, including tokens, passwords, cookies, files, and account details, and then exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled endpoints. This behavior is characteristic of malware, specifically info-stealers and credential harvesters.",
