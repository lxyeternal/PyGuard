This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at fingerprinting or exfiltrating user environment details without user consent. The code does not perform any legitimate package installation or setup tasks related to its stated purpose, indicating that its primary intent is to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information surreptitiously.",
