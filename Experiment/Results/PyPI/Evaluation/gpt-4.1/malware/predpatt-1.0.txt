      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a post-installation routine (_post_install) that executes upon package installation. This routine performs several malicious actions: it writes a proof message to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt', retrieves the system's external IP address, gathers the hostname and current directory path, encodes this information in base64, and then sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (https://kotko.org). This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at spying or tracking the user system.",
