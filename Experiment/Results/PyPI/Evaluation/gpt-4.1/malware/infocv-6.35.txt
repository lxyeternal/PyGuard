      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is hidden and obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique employed by malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing this command, which could be a trigger or a marker for malicious activity. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution or payload delivery.",
