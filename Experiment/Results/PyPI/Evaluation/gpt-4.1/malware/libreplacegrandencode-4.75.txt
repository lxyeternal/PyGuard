      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is encoded in Base64 and likely designed to download or execute malicious content from an external source (e.g., 'dl.dr0bpx.com/szgnyq9zubu0qmv/ESQUELE.EXE'). Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or re-infection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional behavior strongly indicates malicious intent, such as malware download or remote code execution.",
