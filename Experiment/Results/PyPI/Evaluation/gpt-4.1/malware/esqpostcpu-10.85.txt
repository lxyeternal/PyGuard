      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the target system, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears legitimate but may be used as a cover for the malicious activity. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent.",
