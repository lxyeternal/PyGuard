      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious stealer designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers, Discord tokens, and other applications. It performs the following harmful activities:\n\n- Collects Discord tokens, user account information, billing details, badges, and friends list by accessing local storage, login databases, and encrypted data from browsers and Discord-related directories.\n- Extracts passwords and cookies from Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, and Edge browsers by decrypting stored credentials.\n- Harvests files from specified directories, including wallets, gaming applications, and other sensitive folders, then zips and uploads them to file hosting services.\n- Retrieves system information such as IP address, username, and geolocation.\n- Sends all gathered data to a remote Discord webhook, effectively exfiltrating user credentials, personal data, and files.\n- Uses threading to perform multiple data collection tasks concurrently, increasing efficiency.\n\nOverall, this code is a comprehensive info-stealer and file exfiltration tool, clearly intended for malicious purposes such as identity theft, account hijacking, and privacy invasion.",
