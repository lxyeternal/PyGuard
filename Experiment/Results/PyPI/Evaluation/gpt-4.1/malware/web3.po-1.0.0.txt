      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that executes encrypted malicious payloads when run on Windows systems. Specifically, during installation, it decrypts and executes code using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme, which is a common obfuscation technique. The decrypted payload is executed via `exec()`, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the compromised system. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to install malware, steal data, or establish remote access without user consent.",
