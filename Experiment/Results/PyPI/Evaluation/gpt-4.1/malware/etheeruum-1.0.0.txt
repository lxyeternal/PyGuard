      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload that executes encrypted code upon installation on Windows systems. Specifically, during the installation process, it decrypts a Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it via `exec()`. This behavior allows the attacker to run arbitrary malicious code silently, which can include malware, backdoors, or other harmful actions. The use of encryption and obfuscation indicates an intent to hide malicious intent, and executing code during setup is a common tactic for malware delivery. Overall, this code is designed to perform malicious activities on Windows environments during package installation.",
