      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download, execute, or perform other malicious activities without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if the file does not exist, which can be a tactic to evade detection or re-execution. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and the hidden window flag strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing arbitrary commands surreptitiously.",
