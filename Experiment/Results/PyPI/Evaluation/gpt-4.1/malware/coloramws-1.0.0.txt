      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The use of encrypted payloads and the conditional execution on Windows further suggest malicious intent to evade detection and target specific environments.",
