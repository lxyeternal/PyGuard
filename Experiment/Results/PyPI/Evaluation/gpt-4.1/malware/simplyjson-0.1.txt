It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- Collects and exfiltrates Discord tokens, user account info, email, phone, badges, billing info, and high-value friends, then sends this data to a Discord webhook.\n- Extracts stored passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) by copying their local databases, decrypting stored credentials, and collecting specific user data.\n- Harvests tokens from Discord-related files and local storage, then uploads and exfiltrates them.\n- Searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files containing keywords related to passwords, accounts, wallets, crypto, and other sensitive info, then uploads these files.\n- Zips and uploads various application data, including wallet files, gaming client data, and other application files.\n- Sends all collected data to a specified Discord webhook, effectively stealing user credentials, session tokens, cookies, passwords, and personal files.\n\nOverall, the code is a comprehensive info-stealer targeting multiple popular applications and browsers, with the purpose of compromising user accounts, stealing sensitive data, and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server.",
