      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -EncodedCommand' parameter. The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payload intended to run hidden PowerShell scripts, which can be used for activities such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing persistence. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, indicating an attempt to evade detection or control execution flow. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads from static analysis.",
