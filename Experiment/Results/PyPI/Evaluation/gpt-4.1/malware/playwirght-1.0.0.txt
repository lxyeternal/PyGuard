      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that executes decrypted malicious payloads during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, if the operating system is Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a payload using Fernet with a hardcoded key, and executes it via 'exec'. This behavior allows remote code execution, enabling an attacker to run arbitrary malicious code on the target machine. The obfuscation of variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows are typical indicators of malicious intent, aimed at compromising the system during package installation.",
