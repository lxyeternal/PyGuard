      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted string. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and execute malicious code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware distribution. The use of obfuscation (random class and variable names, encrypted payload) further suggests malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and analysis. Overall, this code is designed to surreptitiously execute malicious payloads during setup, making it malicious.",
