      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the code also includes a benign-looking setup() function for package installation, the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The obfuscation and silent execution are typical indicators of malicious behavior.",
