It performs numerous malicious activities including stealing browser passwords, cookies, history, autofill data, Discord tokens, Telegram sessions, Roblox cookies, crypto wallets, system information, and screenshots. It also injects malicious code into Discord desktop applications, disables Windows Defender, blocks antivirus sites, and attempts to bypass UAC protections. The malware exfiltrates all collected data by creating archives and uploading them to external file hosting services, and can also execute a bound executable payload. Its behavior aims to covertly gather sensitive user data, hijack accounts, and maintain persistence, posing severe security and privacy threats.",
