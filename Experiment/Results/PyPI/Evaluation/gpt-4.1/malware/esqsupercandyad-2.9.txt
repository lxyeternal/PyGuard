      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or compromising the system. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide malicious activity or errors, making detection more difficult. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent exception handling are common tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection and maintain persistence.",
