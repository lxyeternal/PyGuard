      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it attempts to import modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', and conditionally executes code that can escalate privileges (e.g., checking for admin rights via 'ctypes.windll.shell32.IsUserAnAdmin()') and manipulate files or system settings. The presence of dynamically generated strings, conditional execution based on obscure calculations, and the use of system-specific modules strongly suggest malicious behavior such as installing malicious packages, creating shortcuts, or modifying system files without clear intent. The obfuscation is typical of malware designed to evade detection and analysis.",
