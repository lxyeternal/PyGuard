      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', creating shortcuts, manipulating environment variables, and performing file system operations such as creating directories, checking for administrative privileges, and creating shortcuts or saving files. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious activities such as installing malware, escalating privileges, or exfiltrating data. The presence of a setup function with a package named 'ppython-binance' may be a decoy or a cover for malicious payloads. Overall, this code exhibits typical traits of malware or backdoor scripts, indicating it is malicious.",
