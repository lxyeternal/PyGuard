      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains embedded base64-encoded payloads that, when decoded and executed, perform malicious activities. Specifically, the decoded payloads include obfuscated code that appears to establish a reverse shell or remote command execution, potentially connecting to an attacker-controlled server. The code also references functions related to network communication, command execution, and file operations, which are typical in malware designed for remote control, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The presence of base64-encoded, dynamically executed code, combined with the obfuscation and the context of network and system control functions, strongly indicates malicious intent and behavior aimed at unauthorized access or control of the host system.",
