      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear intentionally designed to hide malicious behavior. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor activity. The use of heavily encoded, meaningless variable names, and complex bitwise operations strongly suggests an attempt to evade detection and conceal malicious intent. Specifically, it can execute system-level operations such as creating shortcuts, checking for administrator privileges, and potentially executing or manipulating files covertly. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts aiming to compromise system security, exfiltrate data, or establish persistence. Therefore, the code is malicious.",
