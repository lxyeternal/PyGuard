This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it involves data exfiltration without user consent or awareness. The purpose appears to be to gather environment details potentially for tracking, fingerprinting, or further malicious actions. Such behavior is typical of malware or malicious scripts designed to spy on or compromise the target system.",
