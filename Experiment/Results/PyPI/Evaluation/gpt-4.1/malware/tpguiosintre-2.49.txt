      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 that is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the PowerShell command. Additionally, the code attempts to run setup for a Python package, which appears legitimate but may be a cover for malicious activity or to mask the malicious PowerShell execution. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with 'powershell' and an encoded command, especially with 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' and 'WindowStyle Hidden', strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
