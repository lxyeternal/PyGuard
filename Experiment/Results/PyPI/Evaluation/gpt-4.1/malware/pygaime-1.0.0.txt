      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the installation process on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme. This behavior is hidden within the 'run' method of a custom 'install' command class, which is invoked during package setup. The embedded encrypted payload, once decrypted, is executed directly via 'exec', allowing the attacker to run arbitrary malicious code on the target system. This pattern indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity within a seemingly legitimate setup script, making it highly malicious.",
