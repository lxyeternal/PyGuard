      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that executes a decryption of an embedded encrypted payload using Fernet, and then executes the decrypted code via `exec()`. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows the attacker to embed arbitrary malicious code that is only revealed at runtime, making detection difficult. The use of obfuscated strings, conditional execution based on the operating system, and the dynamic execution of decrypted code strongly suggest malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or further compromising the system.",
