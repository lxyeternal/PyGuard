      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the 'fernet' library. This behavior indicates an attempt to run hidden or malicious payloads during setup, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggests malicious intent, as it aims to conceal harmful activities during installation.",
