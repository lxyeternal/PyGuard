      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given the obfuscation and use of hidden window style. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with a setup function that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package installation. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent subprocess invocation indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden or malicious code on the target system.",
