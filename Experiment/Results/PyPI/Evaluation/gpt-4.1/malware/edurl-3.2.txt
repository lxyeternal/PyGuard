      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which suggests persistence or setup behavior typical of malware. The presence of such obfuscated execution and conditional triggers indicates malicious intent, potentially to download, execute, or manipulate system resources covertly.",
