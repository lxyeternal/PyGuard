      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code using the Fernet symmetric encryption module. This behavior suggests the code is designed to silently run malicious payloads during package installation, potentially allowing remote code execution, data theft, or other malicious activities without user awareness. The obfuscation and conditional execution on Windows further indicate malicious intent to exploit specific environments.",
