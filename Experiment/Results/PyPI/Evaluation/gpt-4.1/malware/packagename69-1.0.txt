      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious stealer designed to extract sensitive user information from Discord and web browsers. It performs several malicious actions, including: \n- Collecting Discord tokens, user account details, billing information, badges, and friends list by accessing Discord's API endpoints.\n- Extracting stored passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers and possibly other applications like MetaMask, Exodus, and Steam by copying their local database files, decrypting stored credentials, and parsing the data.\n- Gathering tokens from browser logs and local storage, then validating and uploading them.\n- Zipping and exfiltrating browser data, wallet files, and other sensitive files from user directories.\n- Sending all collected data to a specified Discord webhook, effectively stealing user credentials, session tokens, cookies, passwords, and other personal information.\n- The code also attempts to install missing Python modules silently, which indicates an effort to ensure it runs even if dependencies are absent.\nOverall, this script is a comprehensive information stealer targeting Discord users and browser data, with the intent to exfiltrate private user data for malicious purposes.",
