      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated or encrypted payload that leverages the 'pytransform' and 'pyarmor_runtime' functions, which are associated with code obfuscation and licensing protection tools. The presence of a large binary blob passed to '__pyarmor__' suggests it may contain malicious code or payloads concealed within. Such techniques are often used to hide malicious behavior, such as executing unauthorized code, establishing backdoors, or downloading/executing further malicious payloads. The code's obfuscation and use of proprietary runtime functions strongly indicate malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and analysis.",
