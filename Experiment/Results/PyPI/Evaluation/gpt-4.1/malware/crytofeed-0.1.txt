      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', executing system-level operations such as creating shortcuts, checking for administrative privileges, and manipulating files and directories. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, environment variable access, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at covertly installing, executing, or manipulating system components or files. The presence of code that interacts with system internals and the use of obfuscation techniques are typical indicators of malicious intent, such as malware or backdoor installation.",
