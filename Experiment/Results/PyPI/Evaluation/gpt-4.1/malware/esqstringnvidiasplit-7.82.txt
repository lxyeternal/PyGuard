      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/szgnyt9zubu0qmv/ESQEULE.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly benign Python package setup, which may serve as a decoy or to avoid suspicion, but the primary malicious behavior is the hidden PowerShell execution designed to run malicious code silently.",
