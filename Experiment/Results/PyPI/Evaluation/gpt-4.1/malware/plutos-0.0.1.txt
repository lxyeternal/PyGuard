It then executes these files, which could be malicious payloads such as malware, remote access tools, or other harmful software. Additionally, it attempts to delete the downloaded files and remove the directory, likely to cover tracks. This behavior indicates an intent to silently install and run malicious software on the victim's machine, making the code highly malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL, saves it to a disguised system folder named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK', and then executes it. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently fetch and run potentially harmful malware without user consent or knowledge. The use of a disguised folder name and automatic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, persistence, or malware distribution.",
