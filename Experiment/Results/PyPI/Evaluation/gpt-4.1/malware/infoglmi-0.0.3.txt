      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable script or binary from a remote URL ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misbebra-lol/actions-test/main/node') and saves it to '/tmp/node'. It then sets executable permissions and runs this file with the '--nicehash' argument. This behavior suggests the code is attempting to execute a potentially malicious or unauthorized program, likely for purposes such as cryptocurrency mining, remote control, or other malicious activities. Additionally, the code writes a configuration file ('/tmp/config.json') that appears to configure mining parameters, further indicating intent to perform unauthorized mining operations. Overall, this code exhibits typical characteristics of malware or cryptojacking scripts.",
