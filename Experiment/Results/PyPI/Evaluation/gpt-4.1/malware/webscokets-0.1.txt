      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic, including dynamic import of modules such as 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', which are commonly used for system-level operations and potentially malicious activities like privilege escalation, system modification, or remote control. It performs convoluted calculations to set control variables, then executes conditional logic that can create shortcuts, delete files, or access system paths, often based on environment variables or file path checks. The presence of code that manipulates system files, creates shortcuts, and uses system-specific modules indicates malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, malware, or exfiltrating data. The obfuscation and use of dynamic code generation strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at system compromise or stealthy payload delivery.",
