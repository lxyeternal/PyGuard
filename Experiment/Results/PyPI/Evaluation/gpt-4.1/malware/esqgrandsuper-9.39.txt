      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that likely performs malicious activities such as downloading or executing additional payloads from external sources (e.g., 'dl.droppbx.com') without user consent. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently compromise the system, making the code malicious. Additionally, the code's obfuscation and hidden execution further suggest malicious intent.",
