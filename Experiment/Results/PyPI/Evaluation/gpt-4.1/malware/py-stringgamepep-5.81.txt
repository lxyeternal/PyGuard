      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command likely fetches or runs malicious code from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'https://dl.dropx.com/szgnyti9bub0qmv/ESQEule.exe'), potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hide failures and hinder detection. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent aimed at covertly executing malicious payloads on the host system.",
