      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given its obfuscated nature. Additionally, the code silently ignores errors with broad except clauses, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with silent error suppression indicates malicious intent, potentially used for remote code execution, malware deployment, or persistence mechanisms.",
