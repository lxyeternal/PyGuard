      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently. The URL embedded within the command ('cdn.discordapp.com/attackments/10311686717423501312/107974947515094848/') suggests it may be used to download or execute malicious content from a remote server. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to run hidden, obfuscated commands that could facilitate malware download, remote access, or other malicious activities. The presence of such obfuscated execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
