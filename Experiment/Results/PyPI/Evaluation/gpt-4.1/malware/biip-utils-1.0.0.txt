      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class `GruppeInstall` that overrides the `install` command to execute a decryption and execution of potentially malicious code during installation. Specifically, it uses the `Fernet` symmetric encryption to decrypt a payload and then executes it with `exec()`. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, which can be used to run malicious code on the target system. Additionally, the presence of obfuscated strings and the use of `exec()` to run decrypted code are common tactics in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. Overall, this code is designed to perform malicious actions during the installation process, making it malicious.",
