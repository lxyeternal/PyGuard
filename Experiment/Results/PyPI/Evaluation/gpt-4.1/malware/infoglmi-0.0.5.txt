      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a suspicious URL ('https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node') and saves it as '/tmp/node'. It then creates a configuration file '/tmp/config.json' with parameters that suggest it is configuring a cryptocurrency mining setup (e.g., 'mode': 'nicehash', 'pools' with a specific IP address). Finally, it makes the downloaded file executable and runs it. This behavior indicates the code is likely intended to install and execute a cryptocurrency miner without user consent, which is malicious activity. The code also attempts to disguise itself as a legitimate Python package setup, but the core malicious behavior is the download and execution of potentially harmful mining software.",
