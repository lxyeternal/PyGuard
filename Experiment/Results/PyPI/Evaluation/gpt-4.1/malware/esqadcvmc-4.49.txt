      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the target system, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks to suppress errors and the presence of suspicious comments (e.g., 'www.esquelesquad.rip') further indicate malicious intent. The setup function appears legitimate but may be used as a decoy or to facilitate malicious activities under the guise of a benign package installation.",
