It performs extensive data theft activities, including stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and other sensitive information from browsers and applications. It exfiltrates system information, captures screenshots, and collects Discord tokens and Roblox cookies. The code then compresses and uploads these data to external servers, often via anonymous file hosting services, indicating intent to secretly harvest user credentials and private data. Additionally, it can disable security features, terminate security-related processes, and manipulate browser data to facilitate further exploitation or evade detection. Overall, it is designed for malicious surveillance, credential theft, and data exfiltration, making it unequivocally malicious.",
