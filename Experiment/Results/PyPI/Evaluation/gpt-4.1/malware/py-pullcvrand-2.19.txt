      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. This behavior indicates an attempt to perform malicious actions such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence on the system. Additionally, the code's use of obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as legitimate setup scripts typically do not include such behavior.",
