      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'discord_ghost' and specifically references 'nukebot', which strongly suggests malicious intent. 'nukebot' is a common term used for malicious Discord bots designed to spam, delete channels, kick or ban users, or otherwise disrupt a Discord server. The presence of such a module indicates that the code is likely intended to deploy or control a malicious Discord bot capable of damaging or disrupting Discord communities.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a 'Nuker' class that can perform destructive actions on Discord servers, such as banning, kicking members, deleting channels, creating channels, and webhooks, all via Discord's API. Additionally, the 'init_nuker' method downloads and executes a remote script from a Discord CDN link, saving it to the Windows startup folder and executing it, which can lead to persistence, remote code execution, and further malicious activities. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious tools designed to damage or compromise Discord servers and potentially infect the host system, indicating that the code is malicious.",
