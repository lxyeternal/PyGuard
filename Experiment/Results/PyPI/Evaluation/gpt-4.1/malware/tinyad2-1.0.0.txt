      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds a base64-encoded command that, when executed during the installation process, performs an HTTP request to a specified IP address (192.168.1.3:8000). This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to exfiltrate data, contact a command-and-control server, or perform other malicious activities. The execution occurs in the 'notmalfunc' function, which is called during the 'install' command, making it likely to run automatically when the package is installed. Overall, this code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an external network request during installation, which is a common tactic for malicious Python packages.",
