      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds a base64-encoded command that, when executed during the installation process, runs an 'echo' command to output 'hola quE tal > true.xml'. This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary shell commands during package installation, which can be used to perform malicious actions such as executing arbitrary code, exfiltrating data, or modifying system state. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command further indicates malicious intent, as it attempts to obfuscate the behavior from casual inspection.",
