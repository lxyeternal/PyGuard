      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code conditionally executes this payload if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, indicating an attempt to avoid detection or repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent.",
