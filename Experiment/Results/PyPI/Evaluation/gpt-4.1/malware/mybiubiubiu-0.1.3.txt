This behavior resembles data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious activity. Additionally, the code contains commented-out sections that suggest it was designed to write potentially malicious payloads or execute code dynamically, further indicating malicious intent. The use of hardcoded IP addresses and the transmission of system details without user consent strongly suggest this code is intended for malicious purposes, such as spying, unauthorized data collection, or establishing a command-and-control channel.",
