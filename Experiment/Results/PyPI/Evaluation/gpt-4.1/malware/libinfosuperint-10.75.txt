      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads from external sources (e.g., the URL 'https://dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zubu0qmv/Esquequele.exe'). This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and potentially execute malicious software, which is characteristic of malware or malicious scripts. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, possibly to avoid detection or re-infection. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent by executing hidden commands that could compromise the system.",
