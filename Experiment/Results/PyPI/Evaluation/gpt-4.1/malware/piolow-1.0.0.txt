      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via Fernet encryption. This behavior indicates an attempt to run hidden, potentially harmful payloads during package installation, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to execute arbitrary code without user awareness. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, malware, or other harmful components.",
