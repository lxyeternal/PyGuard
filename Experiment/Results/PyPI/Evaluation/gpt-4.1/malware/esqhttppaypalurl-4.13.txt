      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and may perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' combined with the obfuscated string indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window), which is characteristic of malicious scripts aiming to avoid user detection. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious behavior.",
