      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a base64-encoded string suggests obfuscation to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only then executes the payload, which could be a way to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious code covertly.",
