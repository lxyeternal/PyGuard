      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from a Fernet-encrypted payload embedded within the script. This payload is likely malicious, enabling remote code execution or other harmful actions. The obfuscation of variable names, the use of encrypted payloads, and the conditional execution only on Windows strongly suggest malicious intent, aiming to compromise the host system during installation.",
