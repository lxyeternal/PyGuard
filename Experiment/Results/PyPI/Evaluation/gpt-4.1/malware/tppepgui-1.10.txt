      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears legitimate but is likely a cover for the malicious activity. The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command and the attempt to run it silently indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
