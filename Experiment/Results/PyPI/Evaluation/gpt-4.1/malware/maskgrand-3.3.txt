      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which runs silently in the background. This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts that aim to execute hidden or obfuscated commands, potentially for malicious purposes such as downloading, installing malware, or establishing persistence. The use of encoded commands and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious intent, especially since the payload is obfuscated and executed without user awareness. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful setup or legitimate package installation, further indicating that its primary purpose is covert execution of malicious code.",
