It also checks for Java installation, and if present, downloads a Java archive ('dcbot.jar') from another URL and copies it to the user's startup folder, then executes it. This behavior indicates persistence mechanisms and remote control capabilities typical of malware, such as remote access trojans or botnets, aiming to compromise the system, maintain persistence, and potentially perform malicious activities without user consent.",

It also checks for Java installation, and if present, downloads a Java archive ('dcbot.jar') from another URL and copies it to the user's startup folder, then executes it. This behavior indicates an attempt to establish persistence and run malicious payloads, characteristic of malware or remote access trojans (RATs). The use of external URLs, silent downloads, and execution of downloaded files strongly suggest malicious intent.",
