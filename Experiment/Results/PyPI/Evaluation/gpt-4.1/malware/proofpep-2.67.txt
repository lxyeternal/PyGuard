      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package installation. The combination of obfuscated command execution and package setup suggests malicious intent, potentially to download, execute, or persist malicious payloads on the target system.",
