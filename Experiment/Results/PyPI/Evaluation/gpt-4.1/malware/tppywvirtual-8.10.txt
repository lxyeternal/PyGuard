      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This command could download, execute, or perform other malicious activities without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then proceeds to run the PowerShell command, indicating an attempt to evade detection or execute payloads conditionally. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to hide malicious actions.",
