      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to decrypt and execute a payload using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme, which is a common technique for obfuscating malicious code. It installs the 'fernet' module dynamically, then decrypts a large encrypted string, and executes the resulting code via 'exec'. This behavior indicates an intent to hide malicious actions, such as downloading, installing, or executing harmful payloads, or establishing unauthorized access. The use of encryption and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it aims to evade static analysis and conceal its true purpose.",
