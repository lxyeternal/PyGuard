      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' suggests obfuscation to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only then executes the payload, which could be a method to avoid detection or to trigger malicious behavior under specific conditions. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to run hidden commands and potentially compromise the system.",
