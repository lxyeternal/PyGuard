      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer (trojan) designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers, messaging applications, and other software. It collects tokens, passwords, cookies, and files from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge), Discord, Steam, and other applications. It then encrypts and uploads this data to remote servers (via file hosting services like gofile.io and anonfiles.com) and sends detailed reports to a Discord webhook. Additionally, it copies itself to the startup folder to persist across reboots, ensuring continuous data theft. The code also includes functions to gather files from user directories based on specific keywords, further indicating its purpose to exfiltrate personal and sensitive information. Overall, the script's behavior aligns with typical malware designed for credential theft, data exfiltration, and persistence, confirming its malicious intent.",
