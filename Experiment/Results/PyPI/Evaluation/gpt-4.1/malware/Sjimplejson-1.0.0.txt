      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes remote code fetched via the 'fernet' encrypted payload, which is embedded in the script. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to remote access, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation of variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows are typical indicators of malicious intent.",
