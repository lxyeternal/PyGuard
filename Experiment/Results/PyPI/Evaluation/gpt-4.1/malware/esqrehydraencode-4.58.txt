      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as downloading, executing, or establishing persistence for malware. The use of obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or establishing unauthorized access.",
