      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior suggests the code is designed to silently run malicious code during setup, potentially compromising the host system, stealing data, or installing further malware. The obfuscation, use of encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows are common tactics in malicious software to evade detection and ensure persistence.",
