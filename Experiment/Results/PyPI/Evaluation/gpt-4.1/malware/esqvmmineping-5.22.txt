      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.droppbx.com/szgnyt9zbu' embedded in the base64-encoded string). Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, potentially to avoid repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks suggests an intent to silently download or run malicious code, making this script malicious.",
