This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may be a decoy or part of a malicious package. Overall, the presence of hidden, obfuscated PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent.",
