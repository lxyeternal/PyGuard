      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, which can compromise system security. Additionally, the code includes a seemingly benign setup() call, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, possibly to establish persistence, download malware, or perform other harmful activities without user awareness.",
