      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within the custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes embedded malicious code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This code is likely designed to run arbitrary payloads, potentially allowing remote command execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The obfuscation of the decryption key and the use of a seemingly benign setup script are typical tactics to conceal malicious intent. Overall, this code is malicious and intended to compromise systems during package installation.",
