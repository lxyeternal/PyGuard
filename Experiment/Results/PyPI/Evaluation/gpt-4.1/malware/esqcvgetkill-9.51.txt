      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation combined with silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's behavior of silently executing potentially harmful commands without user consent or transparency confirms malicious activity.",
