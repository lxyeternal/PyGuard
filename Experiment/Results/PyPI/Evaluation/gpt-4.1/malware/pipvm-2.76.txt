The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payload, such as downloading or executing malicious files, establishing reverse shells, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window) without user awareness. The presence of such obfuscation and silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially used for remote code execution, persistence, or data exfiltration.",
