      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'dl.dropbx.com/szgn9t9zbu' embedded in the base64 string). Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration for a Python package, which appears legitimate on the surface but may be used to disguise or facilitate malicious activities such as persistence or further payload delivery. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the external URL strongly suggests malicious intent, such as malware download or remote command execution.",
