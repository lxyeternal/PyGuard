      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. The script also attempts to perform a benign-looking package setup, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell command indicates an attempt to execute malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
