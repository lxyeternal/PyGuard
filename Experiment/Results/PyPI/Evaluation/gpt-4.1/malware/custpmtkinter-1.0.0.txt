      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload within a custom install command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes an embedded payload using Fernet symmetric encryption, which is likely to be malicious code. This behavior enables the attacker to run arbitrary code silently during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or system compromise. The obfuscation of the payload and the use of encryption strongly suggest malicious intent.",
