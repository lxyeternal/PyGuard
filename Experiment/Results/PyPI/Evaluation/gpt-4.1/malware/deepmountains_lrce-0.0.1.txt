      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation process that, upon execution, constructs a reverse shell command targeting IP 121.4.154.240 on port 4501. It encodes this command in base64 and then decodes and executes it via a shell command. The reverse shell, when run, connects back to the attacker's server, providing remote access to the compromised system. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it facilitates unauthorized remote control, potentially allowing data theft, system manipulation, or further malicious actions.",
