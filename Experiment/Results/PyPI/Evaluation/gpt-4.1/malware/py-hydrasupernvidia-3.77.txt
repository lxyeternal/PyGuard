      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness, potentially downloading or executing harmful scripts or malware. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Additionally, the code silently ignores exceptions, which can prevent detection and debugging. Overall, this behavior suggests the script is intended for malicious purposes, such as remote code execution or malware delivery.",
