      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes three executable files from a local server (127.0.0.1:5000), which are likely malicious payloads such as a keylogger, a reverse shell, and a listener. It then runs the listener executable in the background, enabling remote control or data exfiltration. The use of hardcoded paths, background execution, and fetching payloads from a local server strongly suggests malicious intent, such as establishing persistence, spying, or facilitating remote access without user consent.",
