      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as executing obfuscated or malicious scripts. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell code, which is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only then executes the payload, suggesting an attempt to evade detection or control execution conditions. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden or harmful PowerShell scripts on the host system.",
