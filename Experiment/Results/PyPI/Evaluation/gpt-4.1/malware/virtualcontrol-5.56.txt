      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code conditionally calls the setup() function to install a package named 'modlib' with seemingly legitimate metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious activity or facilitate further malicious operations. The use of try-except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior. Overall, the code exhibits typical traits of malicious scripts, including obfuscated command execution and concealment tactics.",
