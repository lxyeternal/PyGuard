      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious intent. The use of encoded PowerShell commands and silent execution are common techniques in malware to evade detection and maintain persistence.",
