      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to download or execute remote content covertly, indicating malicious intent. The setup function, which appears legitimate, is overshadowed by the prior malicious subprocess call, further supporting the conclusion that the script contains malicious behavior.",
