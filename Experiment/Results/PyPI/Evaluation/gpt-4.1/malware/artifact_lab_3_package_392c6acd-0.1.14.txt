      "malicious_behavior": "The code establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server specified by the host and port. It creates a socket connection to the attacker's server, redirects the process's standard input, output, and error streams to this socket, and then executes an interactive bash shell. This allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised machine, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially take full control of the system. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious backdoors and remote access Trojans (RATs), enabling unauthorized access and control over the victim's system.",
