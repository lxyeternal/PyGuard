      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with string encoding, base64 encoding, and dynamic evaluation (eval). It reconstructs and executes a large, encoded payload that appears to be a malicious script. The code likely decodes, decrypts, or decompresses malicious instructions, which could include activities such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or other harmful actions. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest intent to conceal malicious behavior, making it highly likely that this code is designed for malicious purposes.",
