      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is obfuscated and decodes a base64-encoded string that, when executed, likely performs malicious actions such as executing arbitrary code, downloading or executing malware, or establishing unauthorized communication. The use of exec() on decoded data indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent, which is a common tactic in malware or malicious scripts. Without executing the code in a controlled environment, the exact behavior cannot be fully determined, but the structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious activity aimed at compromising the system or executing harmful payloads.",
