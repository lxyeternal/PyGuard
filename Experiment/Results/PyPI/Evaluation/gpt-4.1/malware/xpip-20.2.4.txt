      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits classic data exfiltration behavior. It collects system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory, encodes this data, and then transmits it covertly to external domains via DNS queries (using 'ping' commands with specially crafted domain names) and HTTP requests. The data is split into multiple parts, encoded in hexadecimal, and embedded within domain names or HTTP request parameters, making it difficult to detect through simple network monitoring. The use of base64 encoding, data splitting, and multiple transmission methods strongly suggests an intent to secretly extract and send sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server, which is characteristic of malicious spyware or backdoor activity.",
