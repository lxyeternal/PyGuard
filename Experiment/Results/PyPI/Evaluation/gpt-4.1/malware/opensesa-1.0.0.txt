During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted string, which likely retrieves and runs malicious code. This behavior is concealed within the setup script, making it a classic example of malicious code designed to execute arbitrary, potentially harmful actions during package installation without user awareness.",
