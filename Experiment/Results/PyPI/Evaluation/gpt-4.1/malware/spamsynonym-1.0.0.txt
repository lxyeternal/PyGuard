      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a remote Python script ('rat.py') from a Discord CDN URL during installation, which is a common tactic for deploying remote access trojans (RATs) or other malicious payloads. Additionally, it installs required dependencies silently if missing, and sets up a command-line entry point that likely runs the malicious script. This behavior indicates an intent to infect or compromise the host system by executing arbitrary code fetched from an external source, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
