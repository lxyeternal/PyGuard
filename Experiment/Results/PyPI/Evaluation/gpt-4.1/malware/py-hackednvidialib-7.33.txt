      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is likely designed to download or execute malicious content silently in the background, as indicated by the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a Base64 string. Additionally, the code creates a setup script that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities, such as installing malicious packages or establishing persistence. The combination of obfuscated command execution and the presence of suspicious package installation strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or exfiltrate data.",
