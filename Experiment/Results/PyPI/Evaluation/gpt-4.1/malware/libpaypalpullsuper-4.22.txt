      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL-like string in the encoded command). Additionally, the code creates a seemingly benign Python package setup, but this appears to be a cover or decoy. The presence of the PowerShell command that runs with hidden window style and encoded content strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing harmful scripts without user awareness.",
