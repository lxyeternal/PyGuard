      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand <Base64String>' and is run without a visible window, indicating an intent to operate covertly. Although the exact payload is not explicitly visible, such obfuscation combined with the silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious code or payloads on the host system. Additionally, the code's attempt to run this command without proper error handling and the presence of a setup function that appears unrelated to the main logic further indicates malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence.",
