      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which can be a tactic to avoid detection or repeated execution. The presence of such obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common technique used to deliver malware, establish persistence, or perform other malicious activities surreptitiously.",
