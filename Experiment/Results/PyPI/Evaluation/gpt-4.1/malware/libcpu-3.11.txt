      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given its obfuscated nature. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common technique used to evade detection and execute malicious code without user awareness.",
