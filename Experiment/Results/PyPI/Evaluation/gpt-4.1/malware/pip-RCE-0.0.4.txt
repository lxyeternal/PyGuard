      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to covertly establish a remote access backdoor on the host machine. It creates a Python package that, upon installation, writes a script ('remote-access.py') which connects to a hardcoded IP address (82.157.252.61) on port 1234. The script then attempts to open a reverse shell, providing an attacker with remote control over the compromised system. The backdoor supports both Windows and Linux platforms, and it runs automatically during the package installation process without user consent. This behavior enables unauthorized remote access, data exfiltration, and potential further malicious activities, constituting clear malicious intent.",
