      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer (trojan) designed to extract sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following harmful activities:\n\n- Collects and exfiltrates Discord tokens, user account info, email, phone, badges, billing info, and high-value friends, then sends this data to a Discord webhook.\n- Extracts stored passwords and cookies from Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers, decrypts them, and uploads the data to external servers.\n- Searches for specific files and folders on the user's system related to cryptocurrency wallets, gaming accounts, and personal data, then zips and uploads them.\n- Downloads and installs missing Python modules silently.\n- Uses system APIs to decrypt Windows stored data.\n- Uploads all gathered data to external file hosting services (Gofile, Anonfiles) and sends summaries via Discord webhook.\n\nOverall, the code is a comprehensive info-stealer targeting a wide range of personal and sensitive data, with the intent to exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled server, which classifies it as malicious.",
