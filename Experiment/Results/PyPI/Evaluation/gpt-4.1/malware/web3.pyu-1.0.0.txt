      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism within a custom 'install' command class. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes obfuscated code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior suggests the code is designed to silently run malicious payloads, potentially allowing remote code execution, data theft, or other harmful activities without user consent. The use of encrypted payloads and obfuscated class names further indicates malicious intent to evade detection.",
