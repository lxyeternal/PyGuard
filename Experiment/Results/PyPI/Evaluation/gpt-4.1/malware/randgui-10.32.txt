      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given the obfuscation and use of hidden window style. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious activities. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with silent process creation indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden malicious code on the target system.",
