      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and hidden behavior designed to download and execute a payload from an external source. Specifically, it decodes a base64-encoded string that, when executed, performs an HTTP request to download a ZIP file from a remote server, extracts it to a system directory, and then runs a Python script. Additionally, it silently installs numerous potentially malicious Python packages without user consent. These actions suggest an attempt to establish persistence, execute arbitrary code, or compromise the system, which are typical malicious behaviors.",
