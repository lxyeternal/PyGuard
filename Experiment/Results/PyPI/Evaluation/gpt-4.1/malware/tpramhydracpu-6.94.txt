      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide malicious failures or errors. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent error handling strongly indicates malicious intent.",
