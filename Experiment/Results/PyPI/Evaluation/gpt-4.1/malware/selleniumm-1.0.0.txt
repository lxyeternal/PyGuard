      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes remote code fetched via a Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to remote access, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation of the decryption key and the use of encrypted payloads are typical tactics used in malicious software to evade detection and facilitate malicious activities.",
