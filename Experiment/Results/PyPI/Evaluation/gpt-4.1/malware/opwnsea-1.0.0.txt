      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that hooks into the installation process of a Python package. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes embedded encrypted code using Fernet, which is a cryptographic library. This behavior suggests the code is designed to run hidden malicious payloads during package installation, potentially allowing remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The obfuscated class name and encrypted payload further indicate an intent to conceal malicious intent, making this code malicious.",
