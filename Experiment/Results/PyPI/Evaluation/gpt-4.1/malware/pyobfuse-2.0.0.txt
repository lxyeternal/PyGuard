      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and intentionally complex constructs that serve no legitimate purpose, such as dynamic code execution, self-modifying code, and hidden file operations. It uses obscure string encodings and dynamic import mechanisms to conceal malicious activities. The presence of functions that execute arbitrary code, combined with obfuscated strings and conditional logic that triggers code execution paths, strongly suggests that this code is designed to perform malicious actions such as executing hidden payloads, downloading or executing malware, or establishing backdoors. The code's structure and behavior are characteristic of malware or malicious scripts attempting to evade detection and analysis.",
