Specifically, it fetches a URL from Pastebin, which likely contains a command or payload, and sends this data to an external server via an HTTP POST request. It then downloads a script from a remote URL ('https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode'), saves it locally with a random filename, and executes it asynchronously. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code from an external source, which can be used for malicious purposes such as installing malware, backdoors, or other malicious payloads. The code also disguises itself as a legitimate package setup script, further hiding its malicious intent.",
