      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL-like string in the encoded command). Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or ensure the payload runs only under certain conditions. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional logic strongly indicates malicious intent, such as malware download, remote code execution, or persistence mechanisms.",
