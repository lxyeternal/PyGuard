      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed as a malware payload that performs multiple malicious activities. It collects sensitive information from the infected system, including Wi-Fi passwords, Chrome saved passwords and cookies, and Discord tokens. It then uploads this data to a remote Discord webhook, enabling the attacker to harvest credentials and personal data. Additionally, it contains a reverse shell component that can connect back to a specified server, allowing remote command execution. The code also attempts to decrypt stored browser data and extract tokens from various applications, indicating a focus on credential theft and system compromise. Overall, the script is clearly intended for malicious purposes, such as espionage, credential theft, and remote control of the victim's machine.",
