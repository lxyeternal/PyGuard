      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The presence of the URL 'www.esquelesquad.rip' in a comment suggests a possible malicious or suspicious origin. Additionally, the code's primary function appears to be to run an obfuscated command that could perform malicious activities such as downloading, installing, or executing harmful payloads, or establishing unauthorized access. The use of try-except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior or avoid detection. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest that the code is malicious.",
