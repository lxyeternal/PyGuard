      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer designed to extract sensitive user data from browsers, messaging applications, and other software. It collects tokens, passwords, cookies, and other personal data from various sources such as Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Discord, Telegram, and Steam. The script then encrypts and compresses this data, uploads it to file hosting services (like gofile.io and anonfiles), and sends the information to a Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. Additionally, it attempts to kill processes related to cryptocurrency wallets and gaming platforms to prevent interference during data collection. Overall, the code's purpose is to covertly harvest user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files for malicious exploitation, making it highly malicious.",
