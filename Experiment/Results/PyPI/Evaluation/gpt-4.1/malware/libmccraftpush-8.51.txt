      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 that is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the PowerShell command. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package, which appears legitimate, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution suggests an attempt to perform malicious activities such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or malware download. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flags indicates an effort to run malicious code covertly.",
