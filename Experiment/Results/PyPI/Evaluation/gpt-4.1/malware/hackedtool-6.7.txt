      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The specific PowerShell command is encoded, making it difficult to determine its exact purpose without decoding, but such obfuscation is typical in malware or malicious scripts aiming to download, install, or execute harmful payloads. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration for a package named 'hackedtool,' which may be used to distribute malicious or compromised software. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution and suspicious package naming strongly suggests malicious intent.",
