      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear intentionally designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and environment variables in a concealed manner. The use of extensive obfuscation, meaningless variable names, and complex bitwise operations strongly suggests an attempt to evade detection and conceal malicious behavior. Specifically, it appears to be designed to install or execute malicious payloads, potentially escalate privileges (e.g., via admin checks), and manipulate system files or shortcuts, which could harm the user or compromise system security.",
