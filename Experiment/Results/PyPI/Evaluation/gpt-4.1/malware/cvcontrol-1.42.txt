      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code includes a setup function that appears legitimate but is wrapped in a try-except block, possibly to hide errors or further conceal malicious intent. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent process creation indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden or harmful payloads on the system.",
