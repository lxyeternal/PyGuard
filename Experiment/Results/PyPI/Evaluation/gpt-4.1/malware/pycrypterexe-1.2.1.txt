      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed as a malicious payload (malware) that performs multiple harmful activities. It collects sensitive information such as Wi-Fi passwords, Chrome saved passwords, Chrome cookies, and Discord tokens from the infected system. It then exfiltrates this data to a remote Discord webhook. Additionally, it can establish a reverse shell connection to a specified server, allowing remote command execution on the compromised machine. The code also includes functions to upload files to file-sharing services, further facilitating data exfiltration. Overall, the script is intended for unauthorized surveillance, data theft, and remote control of the victim's system, which are malicious behaviors.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is designed as a remote access trojan (RAT) with extensive malicious capabilities. It collects sensitive information such as Wi-Fi passwords, Chrome saved passwords, Chrome cookies, and Discord tokens, then uploads this data to a Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. Additionally, it can establish a reverse shell connection to a specified server, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the infected machine. The code also attempts to maintain persistence and can start local tunnels, further facilitating unauthorized control and data exfiltration. Overall, the code's functionalities are aimed at covertly spying, stealing credentials, and enabling remote control, which are characteristic malicious behaviors.",
