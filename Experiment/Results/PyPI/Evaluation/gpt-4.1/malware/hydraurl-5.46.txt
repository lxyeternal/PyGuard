      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given the obfuscation and use of hidden execution. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with a setup function that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to mask malicious activity. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed in the background indicates malicious intent, potentially to compromise the system or download malicious content without user awareness.",
