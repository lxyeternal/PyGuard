      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors: \n\n1. **Installation of numerous packages**: It installs a wide array of libraries, some of which are commonly used in malware for network communication, cryptography, clipboard access, registry manipulation, process management, and GUI control.\n\n2. **Cryptodome copying**: It copies the 'Cryptodome' directory from one Python site-packages folder to another, potentially to ensure cryptographic libraries are available or to manipulate cryptographic capabilities.\n\n3. **Decrypted and executed embedded payload**: It decrypts a large, base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted payload and executes it dynamically via `exec()`. This payload likely contains further malicious code, such as backdoors, keyloggers, or data exfiltration routines.\n\n4. **Persistence mechanisms**: It writes a script (`pl.py`) to the user's AppData directory and launches it in a new process, ensuring continued execution.\n\n5. **Download and persistence of a remote script**: It downloads a script (`run.py`) from a suspicious URL (`https://kekwltd.ru/run.py`) into the Windows Startup folder, sets it as hidden, and attempts to execute it on startup. This establishes persistent access and control.\n\n**Overall**, the combination of decrypting and executing a payload, establishing persistence via startup folder, and downloading remote scripts strongly indicates malicious intent, typical of malware or remote access trojans (RATs).",
