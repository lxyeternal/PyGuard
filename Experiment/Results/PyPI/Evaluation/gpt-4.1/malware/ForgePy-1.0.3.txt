      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and performs multiple layers of decoding, decryption, and execution of dynamically reconstructed code. It uses a base64-encoded, encrypted payload that is decrypted with a Fernet key, then further decoded and decompressed through multiple steps, ultimately executing arbitrary code via `exec()`. Such behavior indicates the code is designed to conceal malicious payloads, likely to execute malicious actions such as installing malware, establishing backdoors, or performing other harmful operations on the host system. The use of layered decoding, encryption, and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent and behavior.",
