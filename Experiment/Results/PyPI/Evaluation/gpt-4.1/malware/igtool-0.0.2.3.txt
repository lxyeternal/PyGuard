      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior that attempts to silently download and execute a potentially harmful executable file from an external URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') during installation. It also sends system-specific information (the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable) to an external server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation <COMPUTERNAME>'), which could be used for tracking or further malicious activities. The use of 'os.system' to run the downloaded file without user consent and the obfuscated nature of the download and execution process indicate malicious intent, such as installing malware or backdoors on the victim's machine.",
