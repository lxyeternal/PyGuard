      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given its obfuscated nature. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover or be part of a malicious package distribution. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent operations indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden malicious code on the host system.",
