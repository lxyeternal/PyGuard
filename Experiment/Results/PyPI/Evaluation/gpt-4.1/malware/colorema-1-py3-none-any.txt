      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious information-stealing malware (commonly known as a 'token grabber') designed to extract sensitive user data from the victim's system. It performs several malicious activities, including: \n- Stealing Discord tokens, cookies, and Roblox session cookies to hijack user accounts.\n- Extracting stored passwords and cookies from Chrome and Firefox browsers.\n- Bypassing or disabling security protections like Discord token protector and injecting malicious scripts into Discord's desktop application.\n- Killing Discord processes to facilitate injection.\n- Hiding itself and optionally setting itself to run at system startup.\n- Collecting system information such as IP address, geolocation, PC name, Windows product key, and hardware specs.\n- Archiving all stolen data into a ZIP file.\n- Exfiltrating all gathered data, including tokens, cookies, passwords, system info, and files, to a remote Discord webhook controlled by the attacker.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to covertly harvest user credentials, tokens, and personal information for malicious purposes, such as account hijacking, identity theft, or further exploitation.",
