      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the specific payload is encoded, such behavior suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly legitimate metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious activity or to facilitate further malicious operations under the guise of a benign package. Overall, the use of obfuscated command execution combined with the potential for covert operations classifies this code as malicious.",
