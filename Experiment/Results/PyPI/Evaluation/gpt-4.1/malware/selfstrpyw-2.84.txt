      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run arbitrary or harmful payloads silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise or legitimize the malicious activity. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and the silent execution flags strongly suggest malicious intent, such as downloading, executing, or maintaining persistence of malicious payloads.",
