      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or evading detection. The encoded command is base64-encoded, making it difficult to analyze directly, and is executed with hidden window flags, further suggesting an intent to operate covertly. Additionally, the code creates a setup configuration for a Python package, which appears legitimate but may be used as a cover or distraction. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the context suggests malicious intent, likely to compromise the system or perform malicious actions without user awareness.",
