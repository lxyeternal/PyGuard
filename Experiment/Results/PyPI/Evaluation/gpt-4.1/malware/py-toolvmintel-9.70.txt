      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user. The base64-encoded command decodes to a script that likely downloads or executes additional malicious payloads from external sources (e.g., 'esquelsquad.rip' and 'esquelsquad.com'). This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download or run malicious code, making the script malicious. Additionally, the code includes a seemingly legitimate setup() call, possibly to disguise or blend malicious activity with legitimate package installation, but the core behavior is malicious due to the hidden PowerShell execution.",
