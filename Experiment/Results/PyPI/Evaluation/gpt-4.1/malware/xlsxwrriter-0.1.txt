      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded, obfuscated expressions. Notably, it attempts to import modules such as 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', and executes potentially harmful operations like creating shortcuts, saving files, and deleting or modifying files based on runtime conditions. The presence of code that interacts with system components, checks for administrative privileges, and manipulates files suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising system security, installing malicious payloads, or executing unauthorized actions. The overall obfuscation and conditional logic strongly indicate malicious intent rather than benign functionality.",
