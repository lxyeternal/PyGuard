      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and intentionally complex constructs that suggest malicious intent. It dynamically imports modules, executes code via `exec`, and manipulates internal functions and variables in a convoluted manner. The presence of heavily obfuscated strings, dynamic code execution, and indirect memory access indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads or behaviors. The code likely aims to perform unauthorized actions such as executing arbitrary code, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system while evading detection. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious scripts designed to conceal their true purpose.",
