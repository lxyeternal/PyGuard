      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear intentionally designed to hide malicious behavior. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing code based on environment variables, creating shortcuts, manipulating files and directories, and potentially executing system commands or payloads. The use of convoluted expressions, dynamic attribute access, and environment-dependent logic strongly suggests an attempt to evade detection and execute malicious activities such as installing packages, creating shortcuts, or exfiltrating data. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malware or malicious scripts intended to compromise the system or perform unauthorized actions.",
