      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the target system, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may be used as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the lack of clear benign purpose indicates malicious intent.",
