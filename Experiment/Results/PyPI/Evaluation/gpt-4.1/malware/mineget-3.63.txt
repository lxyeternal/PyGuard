      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given its obfuscated nature and the use of hidden window style. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially aimed at compromising the system, downloading malware, or establishing persistence without user awareness.",
