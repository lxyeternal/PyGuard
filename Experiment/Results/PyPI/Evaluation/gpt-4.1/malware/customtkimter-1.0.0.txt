      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that executes a decryption and code execution step during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it decrypts an embedded encrypted payload using Fernet and executes it via `exec()`. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary malicious code silently during package installation, which can be used for malware delivery, remote code execution, or other harmful activities. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further suggest malicious intent.",
