      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to disguise or hide malicious activity, especially given the use of encoded commands and the absence of legitimate functionality. The setup function, which appears benign, is wrapped in a try-except block and may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious actions. Overall, the code exhibits typical signs of malicious intent, including obfuscated command execution and concealment tactics.",
