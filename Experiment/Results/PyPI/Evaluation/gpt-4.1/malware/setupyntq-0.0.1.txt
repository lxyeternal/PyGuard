It imports system modules and executes code that appears to fetch external resources via HTTP requests to IP addresses (e.g., 20.226.18.203) and possibly executes further code from these sources. The presence of URL requests, dynamic code execution, and obfuscated payloads strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading and executing malicious payloads, remote command and control, or data exfiltration.",
