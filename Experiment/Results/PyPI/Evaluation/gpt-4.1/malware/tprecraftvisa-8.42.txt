      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially for remote control, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup() call, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent. Overall, the code contains obfuscated, hidden execution of external commands, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.",
