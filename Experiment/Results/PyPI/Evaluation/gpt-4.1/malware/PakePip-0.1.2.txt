      "malicious_behavior": "The code injects a reverse shell payload during the installation process, which connects back to a specified remote host and port. This reverse shell allows an attacker to gain remote control over the compromised system, effectively turning the installation process into a backdoor. The payload is encoded in base64 and executed via a shell command, making it stealthy and potentially difficult to detect. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at unauthorized remote access and control.",
