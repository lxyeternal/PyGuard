This behavior is triggered automatically during the installation process of the package, which is a common tactic used in supply chain attacks or malicious package distribution. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function related to the package's intended purpose, and the exfiltration of environment variables without user consent constitutes malicious activity aimed at data theft or reconnaissance.",
