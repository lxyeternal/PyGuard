      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the exact payload is encoded, such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious payloads, or to establish persistence or communication with a command-and-control server. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command execution is a significant red flag for malicious activity.",
