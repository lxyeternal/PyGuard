      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that executes decrypted malicious code during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it uses the 'cryptography' (Fernet) library to decrypt an embedded payload and executes it via 'exec'. This payload is only triggered if the operating system is Windows ('nt'), indicating targeted malicious activity. The obfuscation of variable names, the encrypted payload, and the conditional execution strongly suggest malicious intent, likely to compromise the system or establish unauthorized access.",
