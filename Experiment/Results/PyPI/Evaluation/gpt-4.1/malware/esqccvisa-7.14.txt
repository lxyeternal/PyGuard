      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code's presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution indicates malicious intent, despite the presence of seemingly legitimate setup code. Overall, the script exhibits typical traits of malware, such as obfuscation, hidden execution, and potential remote control or payload delivery.",
