      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with a hidden window and an encoded command suggests an attempt to run malicious code stealthily. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') before executing this command, possibly as a trigger or condition for malicious activity. The presence of such obfuscated and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
