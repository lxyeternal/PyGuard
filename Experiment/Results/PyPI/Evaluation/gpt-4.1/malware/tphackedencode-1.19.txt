      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if the file does not exist, which can be a tactic to evade detection or re-execution. The presence of obfuscated commands and silent execution indicates malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or maintaining persistence.",
