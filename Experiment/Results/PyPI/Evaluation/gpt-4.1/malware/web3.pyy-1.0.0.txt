      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via the Fernet encryption scheme. Specifically, during the installation process, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext to obtain and execute arbitrary code. This behavior allows the attacker to run malicious payloads silently during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. The obfuscation of variable names and the embedding of encrypted payloads are typical tactics used in malicious Python packages to evade detection.",
