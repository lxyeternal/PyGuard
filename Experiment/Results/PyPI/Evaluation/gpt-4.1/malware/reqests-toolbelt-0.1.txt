      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic, including dynamically generated strings, nested loops, conditional execution, and the use of obscure variable names. It performs actions such as installing packages via pip, creating shortcuts, manipulating environment variables, and writing or saving files, often under conditions that suggest hidden or malicious intent. The presence of code that attempts to escalate privileges (e.g., checking for admin rights), create shortcuts, and manipulate system paths indicates malicious behavior aimed at compromising system security, installing unwanted software, or executing malicious payloads. The overall obfuscation and the use of dynamic string generation strongly suggest malicious intent designed to evade detection and perform harmful operations.",
