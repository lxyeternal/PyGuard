      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is executed silently without user awareness. This command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads, as indicated by the obfuscated and encoded nature of the PowerShell command. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which could be used to disguise malicious intent or establish persistence. Overall, the presence of hidden encoded commands and the obfuscation techniques strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at executing arbitrary or harmful code on the target system.",
