      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that executes decrypted code during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it decrypts a payload using Fernet encryption and executes it via `exec()`, which can run arbitrary malicious code. This behavior is concealed within an overridden `install` class, making it difficult to detect. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional execution only on Windows strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution or malware deployment.",
