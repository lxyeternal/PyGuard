      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with the window hidden, indicating an intent to run malicious or unauthorized code silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the payload, which could be a way to evade detection or control execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it is a common technique used to hide malicious activities such as malware download, data exfiltration, or remote command execution.",
