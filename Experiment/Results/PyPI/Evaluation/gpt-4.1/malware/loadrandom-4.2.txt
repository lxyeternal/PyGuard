      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and a base64-encoded string suggests obfuscation intended to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the payload, which may be a way to avoid repeated execution or to target specific environments. Overall, these behaviors indicate malicious intent, likely aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistent access.",
