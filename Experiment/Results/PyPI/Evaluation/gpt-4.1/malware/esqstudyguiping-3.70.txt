      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing remote payloads, establishing persistence, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated and conditional remote code execution behavior indicates malicious intent.",
