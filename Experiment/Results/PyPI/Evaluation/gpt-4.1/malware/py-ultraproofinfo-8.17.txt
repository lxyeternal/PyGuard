      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the exact payload is encoded, such behavior suggests malicious intent, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malicious code. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run this obfuscated command, which is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions.",
