      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors, including: 1. Stealing Discord tokens from various browsers and Firefox profiles by decrypting stored credentials and cookies, then exfiltrating them via Discord webhooks. 2. Extracting sensitive user information such as email, phone, Nitro status, badges, billing info, guilds, friends, gift codes, and other personal data, then sending it to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook. 3. Capturing system information, including hardware IDs, IP address, MAC address, and screenshots, and sending this data to the webhook. 4. Persisting itself by copying the executable to a directory within APPDATA, creating a batch file, and adding a registry key to ensure it runs on startup, effectively establishing persistence. 5. The code also contains commented-out anti-debugging checks, indicating an attempt to evade analysis. Overall, the script is designed to covertly collect, exfiltrate, and persistently operate on a victim's machine, which are hallmark behaviors of malware, specifically info-stealers and remote access trojans (RATs).",
