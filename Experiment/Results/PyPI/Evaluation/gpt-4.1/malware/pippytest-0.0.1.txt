It then executes these files, which are likely malicious payloads. The code also attempts to clean up by deleting the downloaded files and removing the directory. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently install and run malicious software, potentially for remote control, data theft, or other harmful activities. The use of obfuscated filenames and the direct execution of downloaded binaries are classic indicators of malicious intent.",
