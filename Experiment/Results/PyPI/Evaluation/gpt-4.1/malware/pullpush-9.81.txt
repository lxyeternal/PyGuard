      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. Although the exact payload is encoded, such obfuscation and silent execution are typical indicators of malicious activity, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks around potentially suspicious operations suggests an attempt to conceal or suppress errors, further indicating malicious intent.",
