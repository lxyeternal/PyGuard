      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It performs extensive data theft activities, including stealing cookies, passwords, tokens, and other sensitive information from browsers and applications. It exfiltrates system information, captures screenshots, and collects user credentials from various sources such as Chrome, Firefox, Roblox, and Steam. The code also searches for specific files related to passwords and cryptocurrencies on the user's system, uploads stolen data to external servers or anonymous file hosting services, and potentially terminates security or monitoring processes. Additionally, it can create persistent startup entries, disable certain protections, and send detailed reports with system and network information to a remote webhook. All these behaviors indicate a comprehensive credential stealer and spyware designed to compromise user privacy and security.",
