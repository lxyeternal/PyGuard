      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is likely designed to download and execute malicious content from a remote server (as indicated by the URL in the encoded command). Additionally, the code creates a setup script that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities, such as installing malicious packages or maintaining persistence. The use of hidden PowerShell execution and obfuscated commands strongly suggests malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and compromise the system.",
