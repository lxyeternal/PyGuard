      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. The command is encoded in Base64 and executed with hidden window flags, indicating an intent to run malicious or unauthorized code silently. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the payload, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or control execution conditions. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden or malicious payloads on the system.",
