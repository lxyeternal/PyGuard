      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains embedded base64-encoded payloads that, when decoded and executed, perform malicious activities such as establishing reverse shells, executing arbitrary commands, and downloading additional malicious payloads from remote servers. The obfuscated code is designed to evade detection and dynamically run malicious commands, including network communication with external servers, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The presence of such encoded payloads and the use of 'exec' to run decoded code strongly indicates malicious intent and behavior.",
