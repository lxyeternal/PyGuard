      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag, which runs silently in the background. This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts that aim to execute hidden or obfuscated commands, potentially for malicious purposes such as downloading, installing malware, or establishing persistence. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful setup or package installation, and the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution strongly suggests malicious intent. The overall structure and obfuscation indicate that this code is designed to run malicious payloads covertly.",
