      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially without clear legitimate purpose, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently (hidden window), which is characteristic of malicious scripts aiming to avoid user detection. The setup function appears benign but is likely used as a decoy or to blend malicious activity within legitimate package setup procedures.",
