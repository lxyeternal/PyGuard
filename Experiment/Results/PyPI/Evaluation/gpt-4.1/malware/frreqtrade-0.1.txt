      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear intentionally designed to conceal malicious behavior. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor activity. The use of heavily encoded, meaningless variable names, and complex bitwise operations strongly suggests an attempt to evade detection and hide malicious intent. Specifically, it can execute system-level operations such as creating shortcuts, deleting files, or executing code via Windows COM interfaces, which are common tactics in malware. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious scripts intended to compromise system security or perform unauthorized actions.",
