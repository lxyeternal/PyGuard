      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing unauthorized connections, or other malicious actions. The presence of this obfuscated command, especially executed without user awareness, indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package with seemingly benign metadata, which may be used as a cover for malicious distribution or to mask the malicious activity. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution and the potential for covert operations classifies this code as malicious.",
