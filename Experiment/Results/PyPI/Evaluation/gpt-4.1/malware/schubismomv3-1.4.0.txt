      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom 'install' command class. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes a large, obfuscated Python script using Fernet encryption. This script is written to a file in the user's APPDATA directory and then executed in a detached subprocess with no window, effectively running malicious code silently. The embedded script likely performs unauthorized activities such as remote access, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions. The use of encryption, dynamic code execution, and hiding in the installation process are common techniques used to evade detection and facilitate malicious behavior.",
