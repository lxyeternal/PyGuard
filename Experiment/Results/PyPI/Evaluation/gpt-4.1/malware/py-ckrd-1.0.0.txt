      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that overrides the 'install' command to execute obfuscated malicious payloads during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it decrypts and executes code using the 'Fernet' symmetric encryption scheme, which is hidden within the code. This behavior indicates an attempt to run malicious code stealthily during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware deployment, or other harmful activities. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggests malicious intent.",
