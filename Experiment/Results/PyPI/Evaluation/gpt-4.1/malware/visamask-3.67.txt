      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is a common technique for obfuscating malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is likely designed to evade detection and could perform harmful actions on the system. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide failures and hinder detection. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent.",
