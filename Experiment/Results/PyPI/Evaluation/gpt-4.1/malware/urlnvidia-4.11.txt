      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run covertly. Although the specific payload is encoded, such obfuscation combined with the silent execution suggests malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious software without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to run hidden commands rather than perform legitimate setup or package management tasks, further indicating malicious behavior.",
