      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded within a custom installation command. During installation, it attempts to send the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' to an external server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw '), which could be used for tracking or fingerprinting the victim's machine. Additionally, it downloads and executes an executable file ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') from a suspicious URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') and runs it on the host system. This behavior indicates an attempt to deliver and execute malicious payloads, potentially leading to malware infection or unauthorized control of the compromised machine.",
