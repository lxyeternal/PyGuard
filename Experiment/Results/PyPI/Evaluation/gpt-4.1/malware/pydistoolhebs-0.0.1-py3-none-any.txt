      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious information stealer (commonly called a 'stealer') designed to extract sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following harmful activities:\n\n- Collects and exfiltrates Discord tokens, user account information, billing details, and friend lists by accessing Discord API endpoints.\n- Extracts stored passwords, cookies, and tokens from browsers like Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers, including specific extensions like MetaMask.\n- Retrieves saved credentials and cookies from messaging apps like Telegram.\n- Gathers data from gaming platforms such as Steam, Riot Games, and others.\n- Compresses and uploads the stolen data (passwords, cookies, files) to file hosting services like GoFile and AnonFiles, and then posts the download links to a Discord webhook.\n- Implements functions to decrypt encrypted data using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) and AES-GCM, indicating it targets Windows systems.\n- Uses threading to perform multiple data collection tasks concurrently, increasing efficiency.\n\nOverall, the code's purpose is to surreptitiously harvest user credentials, tokens, cookies, and personal files, then send this information to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook, which is characteristic of malicious info-stealing malware.",
