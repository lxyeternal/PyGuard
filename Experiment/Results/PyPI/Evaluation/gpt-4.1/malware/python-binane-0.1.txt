      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', attempting to create shortcuts, access environment variables, and manipulate files or directories with obfuscated logic. The use of dynamic string assembly, convoluted calculations, and conditional logic suggests an attempt to evade detection and execute malicious operations such as installing packages, creating shortcuts, or modifying system files. The presence of code that interacts with system components and environment variables indicates potential malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malware or malicious scripts.",
