This behavior can be malicious because it allows an attacker to remotely fetch and potentially execute arbitrary code or malware on the victim's machine. The function name 'get' is generic, but the use of 'os.system' with a user-supplied URL indicates an intent to perform remote code retrieval without validation, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts.",
