It also checks for Java installation, and if present, downloads a Java archive ('dcbot.jar') from another URL and copies it to the user's startup folder, then executes it. This behavior indicates persistence mechanisms and remote control capabilities typical of malware, such as remote access trojans (RATs) or botnets, designed to compromise the system, exfiltrate data, or maintain long-term access.",
