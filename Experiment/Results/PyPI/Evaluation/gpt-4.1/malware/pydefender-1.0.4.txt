Additionally, it registers a subprocess call to execute 'pydefender-installer' upon program exit, potentially executing malicious or unwanted code without user consent. These behaviors suggest the script is designed to perform covert communication and execute arbitrary commands, characteristic of malicious activity aimed at remote control or persistence.",

The use of dynamic decoding, string manipulations, and indirect function calls suggests an attempt to evade detection and analysis. Overall, this code is malicious, aiming to execute hidden payloads that could compromise system security or perform unauthorized actions.",
