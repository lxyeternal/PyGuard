      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. This behavior indicates an attempt to perform unauthorized or harmful actions, such as downloading, executing malware, or establishing a covert connection. The presence of such obfuscated execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",
