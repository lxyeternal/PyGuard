      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads covertly. The encoded command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and may perform harmful actions like downloading malware, establishing backdoors, or executing arbitrary code. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with silent failure handling strongly suggests malicious intent.",
