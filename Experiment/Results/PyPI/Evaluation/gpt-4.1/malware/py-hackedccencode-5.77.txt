      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The specific Base64-encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as suggested by the URL in the comment). Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to run this hidden PowerShell command, which is a typical behavior in malware or backdoor scripts designed to establish persistence, download additional payloads, or perform other malicious activities. The presence of such obfuscated execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
