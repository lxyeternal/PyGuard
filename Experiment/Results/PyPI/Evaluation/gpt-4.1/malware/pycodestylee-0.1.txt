      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing code based on environment variables, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories with convoluted logic. The use of dynamic string assembly, indirect module access, and conditional logic based on obscure calculations strongly suggests an attempt to evade detection. Specifically, it appears to be capable of installing malicious payloads, creating shortcuts, or executing arbitrary code, which could harm the system or compromise security. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious or obfuscated malware, indicating it is malicious.",
