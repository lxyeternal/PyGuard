      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and appears to be designed to execute hidden or malicious payloads. It decodes, decodes again from base64, and then executes code dynamically, which is a common technique used in malware to hide malicious intent. The code likely retrieves, decrypts, or executes malicious scripts or commands, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of eval, base64 decoding, and dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at evading detection and executing harmful actions.",
