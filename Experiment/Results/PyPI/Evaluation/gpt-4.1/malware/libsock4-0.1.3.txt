It then attempts to launch this downloaded script in a new process (using 'start' on Windows), which can lead to arbitrary code execution, remote control, or malware installation. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or other harmful actions.",
