      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a setup of a seemingly legitimate Python package, which could be used to mask malicious activities or to deceive analysis. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden or harmful commands on the system.",
