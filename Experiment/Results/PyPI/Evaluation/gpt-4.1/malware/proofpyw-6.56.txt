      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background (hidden window) without user awareness. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup of a Python package, which may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities such as installing malicious modules or maintaining persistence. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden or harmful operations on the host system.",
