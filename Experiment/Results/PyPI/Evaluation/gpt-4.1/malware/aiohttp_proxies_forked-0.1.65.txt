      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically loaded Python scripts that perform malicious activities such as establishing unauthorized network connections, executing remote commands, and potentially creating backdoors or remote access points. It installs various system packages silently, loads encrypted payloads, and executes them in the background, which indicates an intent to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, or control the compromised system remotely. The use of base64-encoded scripts, dynamic code execution, and environment variable manipulations strongly suggest malicious intent aimed at covertly compromising the host system.",
