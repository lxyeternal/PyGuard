      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other nefarious actions. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' suggests obfuscation to hide the true intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only then executes the PowerShell command, which could be a way to avoid detection or to conditionally trigger malicious behavior. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the conditional check strongly indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or payload delivery.",
