      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'EncodedCommand' parameter. The base64-encoded string decodes to a PowerShell script that likely performs malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package named 'tppyintgame' with a package 'modlib', which appears benign on its own but is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. The use of obfuscation, hidden window execution, and the presence of a suspicious URL in the comment ('www.esquelesquad.rip') strongly suggest malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden malicious PowerShell commands, indicating it is malicious.",
