      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that hooks into the installation process of a Python package. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from a remote server using Fernet encryption. This behavior indicates remote code execution, which is a common tactic for deploying malware, backdoors, or other malicious payloads. The obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows further suggest malicious intent, as legitimate setup scripts typically do not perform such actions.",
