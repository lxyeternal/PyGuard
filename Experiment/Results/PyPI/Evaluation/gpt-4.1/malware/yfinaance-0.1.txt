      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor behavior. The use of convoluted expressions, dynamic string assembly, and conditional logic suggests an attempt to evade detection and conceal malicious operations. Specifically, it appears to be executing system-level commands, possibly installing or executing malicious payloads, and manipulating system files or shortcuts, which can harm the host system or compromise security.",
