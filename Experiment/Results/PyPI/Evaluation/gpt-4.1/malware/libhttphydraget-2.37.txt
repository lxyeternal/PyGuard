      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL in the encoded string). Additionally, the code creates a setup script that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or to facilitate further malicious activities, such as installing malicious packages or establishing persistence. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the presence of suspicious URL and the context suggests malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious code covertly.",
