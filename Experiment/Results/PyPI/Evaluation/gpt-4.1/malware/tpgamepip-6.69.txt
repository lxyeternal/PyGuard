      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or activity, such as downloading or executing malicious code, which is a common tactic in malware. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to run hidden, potentially harmful code without user awareness.",
