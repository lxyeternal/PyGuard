      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, potentially installing malware, backdoors, or other harmful payloads. Additionally, the code includes a setup function that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a larger malicious package. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with silent operation strongly suggests malicious intent.",
