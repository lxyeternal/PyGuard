      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `send()` that, during installation, attempts to retrieve a URL containing the environment variable `COMPUTERNAME`, which could be used to identify the target machine. It then downloads an executable file (`ini_file_pyp_41.exe`) from a suspicious domain (`https://python-release.com/python-install.scr`) and executes it using `os.system`. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it involves downloading and executing potentially harmful payloads without user consent, which could lead to malware infection, remote control, or data theft.",
