      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run covertly on the target system, potentially downloading or executing harmful scripts or malware. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' indicates an attempt to evade detection and run silently. Additionally, the code attempts to perform a setup operation that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious activities. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and hidden processes strongly suggests malicious intent.",
