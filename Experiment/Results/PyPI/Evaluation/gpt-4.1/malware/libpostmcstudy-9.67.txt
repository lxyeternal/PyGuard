      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and may perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' combined with the obfuscated string strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently and without window visibility, further indicating malicious behavior. The rest of the script appears to be benign setup code, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution confirms malicious activity.",
