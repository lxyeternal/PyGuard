      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The encoded command is likely obfuscated to evade detection. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide errors that might reveal malicious intent. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution, especially without clear legitimate purpose, strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious code covertly.",
