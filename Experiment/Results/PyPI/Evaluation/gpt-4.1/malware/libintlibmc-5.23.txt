      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL-like string in the encoded command). Additionally, the code performs a setup of a Python package, which appears benign but may serve as a cover for the malicious activity. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution aimed at potentially downloading or executing malicious code classifies this script as malicious behavior.",
