It then exfiltrates this data to an external server controlled by an attacker. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as data theft or reconnaissance, especially since it occurs without explicit user consent and during package installation. The use of a custom install command to embed this behavior further indicates malicious intent, as legitimate packages typically do not perform such data collection and exfiltration during setup.",
