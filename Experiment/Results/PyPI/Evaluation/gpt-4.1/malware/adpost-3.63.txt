      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the 'Hidden' window style and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is often used to run malicious scripts covertly. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content without user awareness. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to silently run potentially harmful PowerShell code, indicating malicious intent. The setup function, while seemingly benign, may be used to disguise or facilitate malicious activities, but the key malicious behavior is the covert execution of the encoded PowerShell command.",
