      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely contains malicious payload or behavior, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads from external sources. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which can be a tactic to evade detection or ensure persistence. The presence of such obfuscated command execution and conditional checks strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially used for malware delivery, remote code execution, or other harmful activities.",
