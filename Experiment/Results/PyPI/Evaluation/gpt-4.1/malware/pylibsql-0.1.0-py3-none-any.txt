It also captures screenshots, gathers system information, and exfiltrates all data to a remote server via Discord webhooks and file uploads. Additionally, it can terminate security or analysis processes, disable certain protections, and create ZIP archives of stolen data for exfiltration. The code is designed to covertly extract sensitive user data, monitor system activity, and send it to an attacker-controlled server, indicating clear malicious intent.",
