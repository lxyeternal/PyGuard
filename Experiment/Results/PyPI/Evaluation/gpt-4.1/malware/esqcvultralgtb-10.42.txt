      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download or execute malicious payloads, establish persistence, or perform other malicious activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks indicates malicious intent, potentially used for malware delivery or remote control.",
