This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or payloads silently on the target system. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may be used as a cover for malicious activity. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent process creation indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
