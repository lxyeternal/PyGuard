      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via Fernet encryption. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware delivery. The embedded encrypted payload, combined with the obfuscated class and variable names, suggests malicious intent to hide the true purpose of the code. Additionally, the code's use of external libraries ('fernet' and 'requests') and the execution of decrypted code during setup further support the conclusion that this is malicious behavior designed to compromise the system during installation.",
