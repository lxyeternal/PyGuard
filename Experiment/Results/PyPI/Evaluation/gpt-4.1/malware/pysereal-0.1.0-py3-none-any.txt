      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to perform extensive malicious activities, including stealing sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, user information, browser credentials, cookies, history, saved passwords, credit card details, and other personal information. It exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks, effectively acting as a credential stealer and information logger. Additionally, it can detect debugging or analysis environments, potentially to evade detection. The code also attempts to extract tokens from various Chromium-based browsers and Firefox, decrypts stored passwords, and gathers system information, all with the intent of compromising user privacy and security. Overall, this code exhibits typical behaviors of malware or info-stealing trojans.",
