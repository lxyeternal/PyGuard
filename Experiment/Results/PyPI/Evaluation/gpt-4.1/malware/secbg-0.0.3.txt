      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a subprocess that runs a Python command importing the 'popen' module or object. Since 'popen' is not a standard module or object in Python, this suggests an attempt to invoke or exploit a specific environment or malicious module named 'popen'. The use of multiple try-except blocks with different commands indicates an effort to execute code in various environments, potentially to evade detection. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts aiming to execute hidden or malicious code, possibly to establish unauthorized access, run malicious modules, or perform other harmful actions.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs extensive runtime patching of network-related libraries and system functions, including overriding socket methods, DNS resolution functions, and request handling. It conditionally injects or modifies network behavior based on environment variables, such as altering DNS resolution to redirect traffic, injecting cookies into HTTP requests, and replacing target ports dynamically. These modifications can be used to intercept, redirect, or manipulate network traffic, potentially for malicious purposes like man-in-the-middle attacks, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access. Additionally, it patches internal libraries to hide or obfuscate its modifications, which is characteristic of malicious or intrusive code designed to evade detection and maintain persistent control over network operations.",
