      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 that is executed silently using subprocess.Popen with the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag. This command is likely designed to perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads without user awareness. The use of obfuscated encoded commands and suppressed window creation indicates an intent to conceal malicious behavior. Additionally, the code attempts to run setup for a package, which appears benign, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Overall, the script is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful PowerShell code, making it malicious.",
