      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing harmful payloads. Additionally, the code proceeds to call 'setup' for a seemingly legitimate package, which may be used to mask malicious activity or to appear benign. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and conditional triggers indicates malicious intent aimed at covertly executing malicious scripts or commands.",
