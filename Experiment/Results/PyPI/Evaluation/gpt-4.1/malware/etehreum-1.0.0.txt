      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code via Fernet encryption. This behavior is hidden within an overridden 'install' class, which is invoked during package setup. The decrypted payload is executed dynamically, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of obfuscation (random class and variable names, encrypted payload) further indicates malicious intent to evade detection.",
