Specifically, it executes a command to append a hardcoded SSH public key to the user's authorized_keys file, potentially granting unauthorized SSH access. Additionally, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior indicates an attempt to establish persistent remote access and exfiltrate sensitive system details, which are typical malicious activities.",
