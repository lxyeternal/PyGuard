      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The PowerShell command is encoded in Base64, a common technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. Overall, these behaviors indicate malicious intent, such as executing hidden commands, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads, or establishing unauthorized access.",
