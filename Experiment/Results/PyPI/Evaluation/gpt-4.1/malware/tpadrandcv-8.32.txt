      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment referencing a suspicious URL ('//dl.droppbx.com/s/zgnyt9zubu0qmv/Esqeule.exe'). This behavior suggests an attempt to silently download or run malicious code on the host system. Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to conceal malicious activity by hiding the PowerShell window and not providing any legitimate functionality, such as the setup of a Python package. Overall, the code exhibits typical traits of malware, including stealthy execution and external payload retrieval.",
