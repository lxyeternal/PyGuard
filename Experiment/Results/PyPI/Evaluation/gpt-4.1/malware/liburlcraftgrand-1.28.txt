      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand <Base64String>' and is run without a visible window, indicating an intent to operate covertly. Although the specific payload is not directly visible, such obfuscation combined with silent execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. Additionally, the code's structure, including the silent try-except blocks and the obfuscated PowerShell command, are typical indicators of malicious or potentially harmful activity.",
