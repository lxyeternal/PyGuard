      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is a common technique for executing obfuscated or malicious scripts. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malware, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent, especially since it is conditionally executed only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution.",
