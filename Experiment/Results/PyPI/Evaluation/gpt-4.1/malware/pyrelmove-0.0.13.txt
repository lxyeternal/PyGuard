      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies from various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Brave) on the infected machine and exfiltrate them via a Discord webhook. It collects sensitive session tokens (ROBLOSECURITY cookies), which can be used to hijack the victim's Roblox account. The script runs indefinitely, periodically collecting and sending this data every 3 hours, indicating malicious intent to harvest user credentials without consent and potentially facilitate account theft or unauthorized access.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a malicious credential and token stealer designed to extract sensitive information from the victim's system. It performs several harmful actions, including: \n- Extracting stored passwords and cookies from Google Chrome.\n- Searching for and collecting Discord tokens from various local storage locations.\n- Validating and retrieving user information associated with the tokens, including email, phone, avatar, billing, and Nitro status.\n- Killing Discord processes and modifying Discord-related files to inject malicious scripts or disrupt normal operation.\n- Bypassing certain Discord protections like BetterDiscord.\n- Taking a screenshot of the victim's screen.\n- Collecting system information such as IP address, location, and computer name.\n- Zipping all collected data and sending it via a Discord webhook, including a detailed embed message.\n\nOverall, this code is clearly intended for malicious purposes, primarily to steal user credentials, tokens, and personal data, and then exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled server.",
