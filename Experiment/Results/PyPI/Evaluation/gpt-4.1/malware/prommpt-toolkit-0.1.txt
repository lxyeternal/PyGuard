      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears intentionally designed to conceal its true purpose. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules such as 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', which are often used in malicious scripts for package management, system interaction, or privilege escalation. The code also constructs and executes system commands, manipulates files, and creates shortcuts with obfuscated strings, likely to execute payloads or modify system behavior covertly. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic imports, environment variable access, and file operations strongly indicates malicious intent, such as installing malicious packages, escalating privileges, or executing hidden payloads. Overall, this code is malicious and could harm the system or compromise security.",
