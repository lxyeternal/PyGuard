      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently. The specific Base64-encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from a remote server (as suggested by the URL in the decoded command). Additionally, the code's primary purpose appears to be to run this payload without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The subsequent setup call appears benign and may serve as a decoy or to avoid suspicion, but the initial payload execution is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
