      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with a hidden window and an encoded command suggests an attempt to run potentially harmful code covertly. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful or legitimate setup operations; instead, it seems designed to silently execute hidden commands, indicating malicious intent.",
