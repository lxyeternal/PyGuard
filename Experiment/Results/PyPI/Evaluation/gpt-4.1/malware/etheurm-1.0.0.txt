      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. Specifically, during installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes remote code fetched via the Fernet-encrypted payload. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, which is a classic malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, along with the encrypted payload, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additionally, the code does not perform any legitimate setup functions related to the package, further suggesting its primary purpose is malicious.",
