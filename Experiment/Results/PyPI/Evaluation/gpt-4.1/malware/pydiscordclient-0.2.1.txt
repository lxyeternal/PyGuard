      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an embedded payload that fetches and executes remote code from an external URL ('https://pub-419bfb1465754687a6ed3a1145bf7202.r2.dev/lSnPxksiKyOTXyT1') using urllib. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. Additionally, the script attempts to open a new process with a filename derived from the current executable, which could be used to spawn malicious processes or persist on the system. The presence of such remote code execution and process spawning indicates malicious intent, likely for backdooring or further exploitation.",
