      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class 'GruppeInstall' that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code using Fernet encryption. This behavior is hidden within the setup script and only activates on Windows, making it likely intended to deliver or execute malicious payloads stealthily during package installation. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution suggests an attempt to evade detection and perform malicious activities on targeted systems.",
