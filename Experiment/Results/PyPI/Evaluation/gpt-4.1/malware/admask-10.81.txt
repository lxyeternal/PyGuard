      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is likely obfuscated to evade detection. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for malicious actions. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' with 'powershell' and an encoded command indicates malicious intent to run hidden or obfuscated malicious code on the system.",
