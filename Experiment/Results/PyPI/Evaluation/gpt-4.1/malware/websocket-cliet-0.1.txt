      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function calls and file paths using heavily encoded and obfuscated expressions. Notably, it attempts to import modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', and conditionally executes code such as creating shortcuts, deleting files, or accessing system information based on obscure conditions. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with dynamic imports and file operations, strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at evading detection, executing unauthorized system modifications, or installing malicious packages. The code's final setup configuration also appears suspicious, possibly indicating an attempt to disguise malicious activity as a benign package setup.",
