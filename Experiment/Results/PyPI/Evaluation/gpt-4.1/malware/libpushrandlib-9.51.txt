      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run silently in the background, potentially downloading or executing harmful payloads. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly benign setup operation, which may serve as a decoy or to avoid suspicion. Overall, the presence of hidden PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands indicates malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious activities covertly.",
