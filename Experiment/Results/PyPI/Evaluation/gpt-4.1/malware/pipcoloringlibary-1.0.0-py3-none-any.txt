It also captures screenshots, gathers system information, and exfiltrates all data to remote servers via webhooks and file uploads. Additionally, it can terminate security or analysis processes, disable protections, and create ZIP archives of stolen data for exfiltration. The code is designed to covertly extract sensitive user information, monitor system activity, and send it to attacker-controlled endpoints, indicating clear malicious intent.",
