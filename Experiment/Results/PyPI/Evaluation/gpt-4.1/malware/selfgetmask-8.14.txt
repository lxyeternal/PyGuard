      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks without handling exceptions indicates an attempt to conceal errors, further supporting malicious intent. The presence of a seemingly benign setup function is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious activity. Overall, the code exhibits typical characteristics of malicious scripts designed to execute hidden commands and evade detection.",
