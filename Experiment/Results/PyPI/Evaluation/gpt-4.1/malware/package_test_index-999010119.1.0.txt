      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to establish persistent, covert execution on multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) by creating scheduled tasks, cron jobs, or launch agents that execute a remote payload. It fetches obfuscated code from an external URL ('https://pastebin.com/raw/VvkKsmxr'), decodes it, and executes it dynamically, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. Additionally, it employs mutex mechanisms to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously, further indicating intent to maintain persistent control over the infected system. Overall, the code exhibits typical behaviors of malware, including remote payload fetching, persistence mechanisms, and obfuscation, confirming malicious intent.",
