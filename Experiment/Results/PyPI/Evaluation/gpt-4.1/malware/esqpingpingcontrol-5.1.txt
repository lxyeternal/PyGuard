      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with a hidden window, and the use of 'try-except' blocks suppresses errors, making detection more difficult. Additionally, the code downloads or executes external content from a suspicious URL ('www.esquelesquad.rip') and runs it silently, which could lead to remote code execution, malware installation, or other malicious activities. The presence of such obfuscated and hidden execution patterns strongly indicates malicious intent.",
