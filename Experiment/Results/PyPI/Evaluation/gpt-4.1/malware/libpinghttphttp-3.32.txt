      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, which can compromise the system. Additionally, the code performs a seemingly legitimate setup process for a Python package, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent. Overall, the script is designed to silently run malicious code in the background, making it malicious.",
