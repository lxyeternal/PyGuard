This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or establish unauthorized communication without user awareness. Additionally, the code creates a seemingly benign Python package setup, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent, such as downloading, installing, or executing malicious payloads silently.",
