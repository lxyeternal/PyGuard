This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code's presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands and silent execution indicates malicious intent aimed at evading detection and executing harmful actions without user awareness.",
