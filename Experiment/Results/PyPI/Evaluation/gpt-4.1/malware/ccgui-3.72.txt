      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given its obfuscated nature and the use of hidden window style. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for the malicious activity. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent operation indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden malicious code on the system.",
