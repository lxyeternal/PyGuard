      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that hooks into the installation process of a Python package. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code silently during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware distribution or backdoor installation. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further suggest malicious intent, as legitimate setup scripts typically do not perform such actions.",
