      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded payload. This payload, when decoded, likely performs malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious scripts or payloads, which can compromise the system. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a long, obfuscated string is a common technique to conceal malicious activity. Additionally, the code attempts to run a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a decoy or be part of a malicious package distribution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution indicates malicious intent aimed at executing hidden or harmful commands on the host system.",
