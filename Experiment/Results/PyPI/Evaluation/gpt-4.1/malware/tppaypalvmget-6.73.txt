      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated and could be used to download, execute, or perform other malicious activities without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only then executes the PowerShell command, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or control execution flow. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with conditional checks indicates malicious intent, potentially for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions.",
