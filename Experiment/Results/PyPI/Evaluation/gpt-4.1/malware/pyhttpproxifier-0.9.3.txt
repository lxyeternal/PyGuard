      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden payload that, during the post-installation process on Windows systems, fetches and executes obfuscated code from a remote server. Specifically, it decodes a base64-encoded URL, retrieves data from that URL, decodes it, and executes it in a new subprocess. This behavior can be used to run arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation and the conditional execution on Windows are common tactics in malicious installers to evade detection and target specific environments.",
