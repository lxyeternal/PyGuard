      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code's presence of a seemingly benign setup() function is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious activity, indicating an attempt to disguise malicious intent within legitimate-looking code.",
