      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic involving dynamic string construction, nested loops, conditional execution, and system modifications. It uses extensive bitwise and arithmetic operations with seemingly meaningless variable names and convoluted expressions to hide its true intent. Notably, it attempts to import modules like 'pip', 'win32com', and 'ctypes', and performs actions such as creating shortcuts, checking for administrator privileges, and manipulating environment variables and filesystem paths. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to evade detection, escalate privileges, or execute payloads covertly. The presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system modifications strongly indicates malicious intent.",
