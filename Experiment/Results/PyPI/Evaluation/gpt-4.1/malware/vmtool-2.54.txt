      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' combined with hidden window flags and the absence of explicit documentation or legitimate purpose strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to run this command silently without user awareness, which is characteristic of malicious scripts aiming to compromise or control the system covertly.",
