      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism. During installation, it decrypts and executes code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload, but only if the operating system is Windows ('nt'). This payload is likely malicious, as it is fetched and executed dynamically, bypassing static analysis. The obfuscation of variable names, the use of encrypted payloads, and the conditional execution on Windows strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially allowing remote code execution or other harmful actions on compromised systems.",
