      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It attempts to install a Chrome extension by creating and writing a 'background.js' script and a 'manifest.json' file into the user's AppData directory, which can be used to execute malicious JavaScript code within the browser context. Additionally, it searches for shortcut (.lnk) files across common user directories and modifies shortcuts pointing to popular browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave) to include a command-line argument that loads the malicious extension. This behavior suggests an attempt to persistently inject malicious code into the user's browser environment, potentially to steal data, monitor activity, or perform other malicious actions. The code also installs the 'pypiwin32' package if not present, which can be used for Windows COM automation, further facilitating system-level manipulations. Overall, these activities are characteristic of malware or spyware designed to hijack browser sessions and maintain persistence on the system.",
