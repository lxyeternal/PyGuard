      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the target system, potentially to download, execute, or establish persistence of malware. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions silently, which can hide errors and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with silent failure handling indicates malicious intent.",
