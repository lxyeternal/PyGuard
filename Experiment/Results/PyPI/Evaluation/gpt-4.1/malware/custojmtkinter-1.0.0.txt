      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes embedded malicious code fetched via the Fernet encryption scheme. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently execute arbitrary code during installation, which is a common tactic in malware distribution. The embedded encrypted payload, once decrypted, is executed dynamically, potentially allowing remote command execution or other malicious activities. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further suggest malicious intent to evade detection and analysis.",
