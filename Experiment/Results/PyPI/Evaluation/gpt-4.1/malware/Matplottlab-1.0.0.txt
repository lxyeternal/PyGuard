      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation command that, during installation on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload embedded within the script. Specifically, it uses the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme to decrypt a hardcoded encrypted string and then executes the resulting code via `exec()`. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code because it hides the payload, executes arbitrary code at install time, and potentially performs harmful actions such as downloading, installing malware, or establishing unauthorized access. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further suggest malicious intent.",
