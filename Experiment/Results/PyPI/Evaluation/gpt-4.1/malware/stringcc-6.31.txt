      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious actions such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or other harmful activities. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with a hidden window and the obfuscated command strongly suggests malicious intent, especially since it is executed without user awareness or consent. Additionally, the code attempts to run a setup process that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover for the malicious PowerShell execution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently indicates malicious behavior.",
