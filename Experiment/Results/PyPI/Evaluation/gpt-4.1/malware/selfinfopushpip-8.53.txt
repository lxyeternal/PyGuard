      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to obfuscate and run malicious code without easy detection. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source (as indicated by the URL 'gitbi.com' embedded in the payload). Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, which can hide failures and hinder detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution combined with silent error handling strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, malware download, or persistence mechanisms.",
