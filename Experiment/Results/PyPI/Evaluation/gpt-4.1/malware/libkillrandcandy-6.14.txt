      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload when a specific file ('tahg') does not exist. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, which can compromise the system. Additionally, the code silently suppresses exceptions, making detection and debugging difficult. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent error handling strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at covertly executing harmful actions.",
