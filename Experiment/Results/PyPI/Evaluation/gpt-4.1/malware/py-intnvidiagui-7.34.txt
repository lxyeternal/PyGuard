This payload is likely obfuscated malicious code designed to run without user awareness. The script also attempts to perform a seemingly benign package setup, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell command indicates an attempt to execute malicious actions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest malicious intent.",
