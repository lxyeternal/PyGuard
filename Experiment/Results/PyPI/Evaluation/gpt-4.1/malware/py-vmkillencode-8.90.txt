      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, suggesting an attempt to avoid detection or re-execution. The PowerShell command is likely designed to download or execute malicious content from an external source, as indicated by the URL-like string embedded in the encoded command. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with the conditional execution and hidden window, strongly indicates malicious intent, such as malware download, remote code execution, or persistence mechanisms.",
