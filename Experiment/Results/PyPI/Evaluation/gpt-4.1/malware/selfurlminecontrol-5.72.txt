      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with the 'EncodedCommand' parameter. The base64-encoded string likely decodes to malicious payloads such as malware, backdoors, or remote access tools. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package named 'selfurlminecontrol' with a seemingly benign description, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command indicates malicious intent. This behavior suggests the script is designed to execute hidden malicious code, potentially allowing remote control, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions.",
