This behavior indicates an attempt to run hidden or malicious code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows suggests an intent to conceal malicious activities, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or executing arbitrary commands without user awareness.",
