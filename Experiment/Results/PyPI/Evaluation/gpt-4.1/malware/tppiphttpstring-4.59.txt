      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious payloads or activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid detection or repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with obfuscated payload indicates an attempt to run malicious or unauthorized code silently on the system. The rest of the script appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command strongly suggests malicious intent.",
