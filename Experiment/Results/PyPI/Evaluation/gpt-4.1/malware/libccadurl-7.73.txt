      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The encoded command appears to be obfuscated, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads or activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, indicating an attempt to avoid repeated execution or detection. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other harmful activities. The rest of the code appears to be benign setup code for a Python package, but the obfuscated PowerShell command is a significant red flag for malicious behavior.",
