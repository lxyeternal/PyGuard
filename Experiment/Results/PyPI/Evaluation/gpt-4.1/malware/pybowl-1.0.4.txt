The embedded base64 string decodes to Python code that appears to make HTTP requests to external servers, possibly to download malicious payloads or communicate with command-and-control servers. This behavior indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent within seemingly benign setup code, which is a common tactic in malicious Python packages. The code's primary purpose is to execute hidden, potentially harmful actions during installation, making it malicious.",
