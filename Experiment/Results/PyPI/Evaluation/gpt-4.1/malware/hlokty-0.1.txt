      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that can cause significant harm to the user's system. Specifically, the 'damage_system' function attempts to delete all files in the Windows System32 directory by executing the command 'del C:\\Windows\\System32\\*.*', which can render the operating system inoperable. Additionally, the script can execute a potentially malicious executable ('kitty.exe') and open a YouTube link, which may be used for social engineering or distraction. The presence of command-line options like '--kill-system' that explicitly aim to damage system files confirms malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to perform destructive actions and should be considered malicious.",
