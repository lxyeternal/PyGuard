      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated segment that decrypts and executes dynamically decoded payloads using cryptography. Specifically, it decodes a base64-encoded string, reverses it, decodes from base64 again, then decompresses, deserializes, and finally executes the resulting code via `exec()`. This pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to hide their true intent, often used to deliver malware, backdoors, or perform unauthorized actions on the host system. The presence of such complex, hidden payload execution strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at evading detection and executing arbitrary code.",
