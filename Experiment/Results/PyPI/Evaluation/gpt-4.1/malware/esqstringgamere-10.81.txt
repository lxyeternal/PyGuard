      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command encoded in Base64 that is executed silently using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag. This command is likely designed to perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads without user awareness. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package, which appears legitimate, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command indicates malicious intent. The overall behavior suggests an attempt to execute malicious code covertly while masquerading as a benign package setup.",
