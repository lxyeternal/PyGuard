      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic, including dynamic import and execution of modules such as 'pip', 'win32com', 'ctypes', and 'os', often through indirect and convoluted means. It performs actions like creating shortcuts, manipulating environment variables, checking for administrative privileges, creating directories, and writing or saving files, which are typical behaviors associated with malware or malicious scripts. The obfuscation and use of dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as installing or executing malicious payloads, bypassing security measures, or establishing persistence on the host system.",
