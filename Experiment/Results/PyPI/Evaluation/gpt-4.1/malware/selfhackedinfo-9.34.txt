      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden PowerShell command executed via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This command is likely obfuscated to evade detection and could perform malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The presence of the encoded PowerShell command, especially with the 'Hidden' window style and no visible output, indicates an attempt to run malicious code covertly. Additionally, the code attempts to set up a Python package named 'selfhackedinfo' with a seemingly legitimate description, which may serve as a cover for malicious intent or to facilitate further malicious operations. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution and the inconspicuous package setup strongly suggests malicious behavior.",
