      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with a base64-encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity such as downloading, executing, or establishing backdoors, especially since the payload is obfuscated via encoding. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful setup or package installation related to the 'vercc' package, suggesting the setup call may be a decoy or part of an attempt to disguise malicious intent. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden or harmful code on the target system.",
