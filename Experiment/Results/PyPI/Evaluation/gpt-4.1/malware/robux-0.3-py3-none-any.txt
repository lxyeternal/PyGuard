      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user data from the victim's machine without consent. It attempts to retrieve Discord tokens by accessing browser storage and decrypting stored credentials, which can be used to hijack user accounts. Additionally, it collects Roblox security cookies, potentially allowing unauthorized access to Roblox accounts. The data is then exfiltrated by sending it via an HTTP POST request to an external server ('https://matched-anthem.000webhostapp.com/'), indicating malicious intent to harvest and transmit private user information. The code also includes obfuscated or redundant installation commands, likely to ensure dependencies are installed, which is common in malware to maintain persistence or functionality. Overall, this code exhibits typical behaviors of credential-stealing malware and should be classified as malicious.",
