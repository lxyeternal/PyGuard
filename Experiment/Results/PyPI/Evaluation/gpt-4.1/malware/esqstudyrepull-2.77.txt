      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated PowerShell command execution that downloads and executes external payloads without user consent or transparency. The encoded PowerShell command is hidden within the script, making it difficult to analyze at first glance. Additionally, the script attempts to run this command silently (hidden window), which is typical of malicious activities such as malware downloaders or backdoors. The presence of such obfuscated code and silent execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to execute potentially harmful code from an external source without detection.",
