      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is hidden from the user interface. The encoded command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, given the obfuscation and use of hidden execution. Additionally, the code silently proceeds with a setup function that appears legitimate but may serve as a cover or distraction. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent operations strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at compromising the system or executing malicious code without user awareness.",
