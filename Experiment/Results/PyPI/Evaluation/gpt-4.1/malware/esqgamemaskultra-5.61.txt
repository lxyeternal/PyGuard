      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code or payloads silently on the victim's machine. Additionally, the code performs a setup operation that appears legitimate but may be used to disguise or facilitate malicious activities. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution and silent subprocess invocation indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data.",
