      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that decrypts and executes obfuscated code during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it uses the 'cryptography' library's Fernet to decrypt a payload and then executes it with 'exec'. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to run malicious code stealthily during setup, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation and conditional execution on Windows further suggest malicious intent.",
