      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It performs complex, meaningless calculations and dynamically constructs function and module names using encoded strings and character mappings, which is a common obfuscation technique in malicious scripts. Notably, it attempts to import 'pip' and install or execute modules, and later on, it uses 'win32com' and 'os' modules to create shortcuts, check for admin privileges, and manipulate files or directories. The presence of code that creates shortcuts, interacts with system components, and the obfuscation strongly suggests malicious behavior such as installing backdoors, executing payloads, or exfiltrating data. The code's structure and tactics are typical of malware designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions on the host system.",
