      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other malicious actions. The use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' suggests obfuscation to hide the true intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only then executes the payload, which could be a way to avoid detection or to target specific environments. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command and conditional execution strongly indicates malicious behavior, likely aimed at compromising the system or establishing persistence.",
