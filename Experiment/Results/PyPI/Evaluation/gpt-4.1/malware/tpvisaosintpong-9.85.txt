      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string. The base64-encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious payloads from external sources, as indicated by the comment 'www.esquelesquad.rip' and the obfuscated nature of the command. Additionally, the code conditionally runs this command if a specific directory ('tahg') does not exist, which suggests persistence or a one-time payload execution. The presence of such obfuscated and conditional remote code execution strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious software without user consent.",
