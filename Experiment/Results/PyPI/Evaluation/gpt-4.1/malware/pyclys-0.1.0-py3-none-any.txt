      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted payloads that, when executed, decode and evaluate hidden code segments. It uses dynamic string assembly, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and eval to run potentially malicious code at runtime. The presence of such obfuscation techniques strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior, such as executing arbitrary or harmful code, possibly to compromise the system, steal data, or perform unauthorized actions. The code's structure and techniques are characteristic of malware or malicious scripts designed to evade detection and analysis.",
