      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen, which is often indicative of malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is hidden and obfuscated, making it difficult to analyze directly, and the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' is a common technique in malware to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which could be a method to avoid repeated execution or detection. Overall, these behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent.",
