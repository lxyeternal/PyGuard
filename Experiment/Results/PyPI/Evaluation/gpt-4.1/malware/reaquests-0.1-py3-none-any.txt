It decrypts the saved passwords using Windows cryptographic functions and Chrome's encryption keys, then compiles this sensitive information into a text file. Subsequently, it uploads the file to a specified Discord webhook. This behavior constitutes credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, which are malicious activities intended to compromise user privacy and security.",
