      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious activity such as downloading or executing malicious payloads. The command is encoded in Base64, making it difficult to analyze at a glance. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the PowerShell command if the file does not exist, potentially to avoid repeated execution. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell execution, especially in conjunction with the file existence check, strongly suggests malicious intent, such as downloading malware, establishing persistence, or executing other harmful actions.",
