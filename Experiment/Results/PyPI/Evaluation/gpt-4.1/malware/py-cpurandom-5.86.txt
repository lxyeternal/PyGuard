      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string, which is likely obfuscated malicious payload. This behavior suggests an attempt to run malicious code silently on the victim's machine, potentially for remote control, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a specific file ('tahg') and only executes the payload if it does not exist, which could be a tactic to avoid detection or re-execution. The presence of such obfuscated command execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",
