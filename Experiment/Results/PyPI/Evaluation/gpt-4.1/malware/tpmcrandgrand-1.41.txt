      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. The command is executed with hidden window style and no window creation, indicating an intent to run silently without user awareness. The presence of this obfuscated command suggests malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing other harmful activities. Additionally, the code's attempt to run this command without any clear legitimate purpose, combined with the obfuscation, strongly indicates malicious behavior.",
