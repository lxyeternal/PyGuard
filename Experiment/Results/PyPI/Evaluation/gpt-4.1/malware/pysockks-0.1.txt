      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits obfuscated and highly complex logic that appears intentionally designed to conceal malicious behavior. It performs several suspicious actions, including dynamically importing modules, executing system commands, creating shortcuts, and manipulating files and directories in a manner consistent with malware or backdoor functionalities. The use of extensive obfuscation, dynamic attribute access, and convoluted calculations strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Specifically, it can create shortcuts, potentially execute payloads, and manipulate system files or environment variables, which are common tactics in malware. Overall, the code is malicious and intended to perform harmful operations under the guise of a seemingly benign setup script.",
