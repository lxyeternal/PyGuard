      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it can be used to download, execute, or establish persistence for malware without user awareness. Additionally, the code's use of try-except blocks to suppress errors and the obfuscated PowerShell command further suggest malicious intent. The setup function appears benign but is likely used as a decoy or to blend malicious actions within seemingly legitimate package setup code. Overall, the code exhibits behavior typical of malware loaders or backdoors designed to run hidden commands on the system.",
