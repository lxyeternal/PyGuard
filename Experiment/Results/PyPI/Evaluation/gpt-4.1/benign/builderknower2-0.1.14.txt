      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation script that, when executed, performs several suspicious actions such as listing the root directory contents (`ls -l /`), checking for the presence of common download tools (`which curl`, `which wget`), creating a temporary file (`/tmp/pytest2`), and potentially exfiltrating environment or directory information by constructing URLs with base64-encoded environment variables or directory listings (though these lines are commented out). These behaviors suggest an attempt to gather system information, possibly for reconnaissance or malicious purposes, during the package installation process. The presence of commented-out code that would send data to an external server further indicates malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to execute system commands that could be used for malicious reconnaissance or data exfiltration, classifying it as malicious.",
