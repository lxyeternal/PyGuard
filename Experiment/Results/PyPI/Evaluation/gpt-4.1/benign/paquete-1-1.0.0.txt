      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function `notmalfunc()` that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via `os.system()`. However, the base64 string is empty (`b64d(\"\")`), so in its current form, it does not execute any command. Despite this, the structure indicates an intent to execute arbitrary code or commands embedded in base64, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malicious scripts to hide harmful payloads. Additionally, the code hooks into the `install` process of a Python package, executing the malicious payload during installation. This behavior can be exploited to run malicious code automatically when the package is installed, potentially compromising the system. Therefore, the code exhibits malicious intent by design, even if the payload is currently empty, as it is structured to execute hidden, obfuscated commands during package installation.",
