      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, after performing the standard installation, executes a shell command to list the root directory ('ls /') and prints the result. Additionally, there is a commented-out line containing a reverse shell payload that, if activated, would connect to an external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7777, providing remote access to the attacker. These behaviors suggest an attempt to gather system information and potentially establish unauthorized remote access, which are common malicious activities. The presence of the reverse shell code, even if commented out, indicates malicious intent or at least malicious capabilities embedded within the code.",
