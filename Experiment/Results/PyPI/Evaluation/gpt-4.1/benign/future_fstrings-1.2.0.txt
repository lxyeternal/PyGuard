      "malicious_behavior": "The code injects a custom installation step that adds a Python path containing an 'exec' statement with dynamically generated code. Specifically, during the installation process, it creates a .pth file with code that executes a string stored in the variable PTH, which attempts to import 'future_fstrings' and register it if available. This behavior can be used to execute arbitrary code during package installation, potentially allowing malicious code execution or environment manipulation. The use of 'exec' with dynamically constructed code in a setup script is a common tactic in malicious Python packages to run arbitrary code during installation, indicating malicious intent.",
