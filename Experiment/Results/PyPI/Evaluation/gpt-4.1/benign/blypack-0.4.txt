This behavior is often associated with malicious scripts attempting to identify the user context for further malicious actions or reconnaissance. Although the code appears to be part of a setup script, the direct execution of 'os.system('whoami')' outside of a controlled installation process indicates malicious intent, as it can be used to silently collect system information without user consent.",
