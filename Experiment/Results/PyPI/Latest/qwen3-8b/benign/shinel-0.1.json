This is a common technique used in supply chain attacks and can be used to install malicious payloads or exfiltrate data. The lack of information about the contents of 'install.sh' increases the risk of hidden malicious behavior."

This behavior is suspicious due to the lack of transparency, the potential for executing malicious payloads, and the use of dynamic execution techniques. Additionally, the script does not provide any user prompts or notifications before running the downloaded script, which is a red flag for potential malicious activity."
