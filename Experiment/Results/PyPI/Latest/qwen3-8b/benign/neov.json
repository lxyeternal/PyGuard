      "malicious_behavior": "The code searches the root directory ('/root') for files with the '.session' extension and sends each found file to Telegram via the function 'send_file_to_telegram'. This behavior matches typical malicious patterns of harvesting sensitive files (likely session or credential files) from a sensitive system directory and exfiltrating them to an external endpoint (Telegram). The immediate transmission of potentially sensitive data without user consent or notification, combined with targeting a privileged directory, strongly indicates data theft and unauthorized exfiltration. Although the exact implementation of 'find_files' and 'send_file_to_telegram' is not shown, their naming and usage in this context align with malicious intent, especially given the known patterns of malware using Telegram bots for data exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it is designed to find files with a specified extension recursively on the local filesystem and then send those files directly to a hardcoded Telegram bot endpoint using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. This constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled external server without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID for sending arbitrary files is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables covert theft of potentially sensitive user data. The code lacks any user interaction, input validation, or legitimate justification for collecting and transmitting files, which aligns with typical patterns of information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be classified as malicious."
