      "malicious_behavior": "The code sends a hardcoded message containing a URL to a Discord webhook URL that appears attacker-controlled. The use of a Discord webhook for automated outbound communication is a common exfiltration technique in malware. The hardcoded webhook URL and the external Catbox URL suggest data or payload delivery to an attacker-controlled endpoint. Although the code does not explicitly collect system information or execute remote code, the presence of hardcoded external endpoints for unsolicited outbound communication without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors involving data exfiltration or command-and-control communication via Discord webhooks, which are frequently abused in supply chain attacks and information stealers."
