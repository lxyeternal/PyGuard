      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple behaviors strongly indicative of malicious intent. It performs network reconnaissance by broadcasting UDP messages to discover a server and then connects to it via TCP. Upon connection, it sends the hostname and shows a notification indicating remote control by an administrator, which suggests unauthorized remote access capabilities. The code includes functions to enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) by changing the network profile to Private, modifying registry keys, enabling firewall rules, and restarting services, which can be used to facilitate persistent remote access. It also downloads files from the connected server and installs software silently without user consent, using subprocess calls to execute installers or arbitrary commands. The use of subprocess with shell=True, network communication to discovered servers, and silent installation of executables are classic malware behaviors. Additionally, the code imports a notification utility to display a toast notification, likely to mask or legitimize the remote control activity. There is no user interaction or validation for these actions, and the code attempts to manipulate system settings and execute arbitrary code from remote sources. These combined behaviors—network discovery, remote connection, system configuration changes to enable RDP, silent download and execution of software—are hallmark traits of remote access trojans (RATs) or malware designed for unauthorized control and payload delivery."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a persistent client that continuously searches for and connects to a remote server over a network socket. Once connected, it receives commands from the server and executes them without user interaction or validation. The commands include installing software from arbitrary file paths, executing arbitrary PowerShell commands via subprocess.run, and performing system fixes or showing toast notifications. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands received remotely enables arbitrary code execution, a hallmark of remote code execution malware. The client silently executes these commands and sends back status codes, indicating a command-and-control (C2) style communication. The code lacks any user consent, input validation, or security checks, and it connects to discovered servers automatically, which is suspicious. The ability to install software from arbitrary paths and execute arbitrary PowerShell commands remotely is a critical risk and strongly indicative of malicious intent, such as establishing a remote access trojan (RAT) or malware downloader. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
