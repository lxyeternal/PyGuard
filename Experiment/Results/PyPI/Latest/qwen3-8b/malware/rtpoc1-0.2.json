      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information by hashing the hostname and comparing it to a hardcoded SHA-1 hash, which acts as a stealthy trigger or gating mechanism. If the hostname hash does not match, the code attempts to silently send an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://5z5bg56mebksjokqd36na9fbq2wvkl8a.oastify.com) without any user notification or consent. This domain appears to be an attacker-controlled endpoint, likely used for data exfiltration or beaconing. The request is executed in a background thread during package import, ensuring it runs automatically and stealthily without blocking or alerting the user. The use of a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure persistence. These behaviors—automatic system information collection, conditional execution based on system identity, silent network communication to a suspicious external server, and execution during package import—are hallmark indicators of malicious activity, consistent with supply chain attacks or information-stealing malware."
