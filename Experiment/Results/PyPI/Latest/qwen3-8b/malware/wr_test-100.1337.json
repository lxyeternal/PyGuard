The use of os.system to execute remote commands without user consent is a significant risk. The domain 'jacobsandum.com' is not well-known and could be associated with malicious activities. Additionally, the script uses a setup.py structure, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks."

This behavior is suspicious and could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication. The absence of user notification and the use of a non-trusted domain raise significant security concerns."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses os.system() to execute a curl command that downloads content from an unknown URL (http://jacobsandum.com:1337/adfslogin). This behavior is suspicious as it involves downloading data from an untrusted source without user consent. The URL appears to be unrelated to any known legitimate service, and the lack of transparency or documentation increases the likelihood of malicious intent."
