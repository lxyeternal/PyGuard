      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior. The most critical red flag is the use of obfuscated code execution in the describe() method: (lambda x: eval(compile(x, \"<string>\", \"eval\")))(eval(self.salt)). Here, self.salt is a string containing obfuscated (hex-escaped) code, which is first evaluated, then compiled, and then executed via eval. This pattern is a hallmark of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution, potentially fetched from a remote source or hidden within the obfuscated string. The obfuscation of the payload (using hex escapes) and the use of dynamic code execution (eval/compile) are both strong indicators of malicious intent, as they are almost never found in benign code and are used to evade detection and analysis. Furthermore, the string in self.salt appears to reference a remote URL (https://v3.mexc.workers.dev/describe.json), suggesting that the code may fetch and execute additional code or configuration from an external, potentially attacker-controlled server. This combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and remote resource fetching is a textbook example of supply chain attack techniques and is never present in legitimate, benign packages."
