It uses base64 encoding to obscure the data, which is a common technique in malware. The script lacks user consent or notification, and the use of suspicious domain names suggests potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The absence of clear documentation and the lack of legitimate purpose further indicate malicious intent."
