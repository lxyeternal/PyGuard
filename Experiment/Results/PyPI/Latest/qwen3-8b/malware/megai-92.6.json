This is a suspicious pattern often used by malicious packages to execute arbitrary code without user consent. The lack of transparency and the use of an install hook for code execution raise strong indicators of potential malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The script collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses) and transmits it to hardcoded, suspicious URLs without user consent. The use of Base64 encoding on the MAC addresses suggests an attempt to obscure data transmission. The presence of suspicious domain names and lack of clear legitimate purpose indicates potential data exfiltration or command-and-control communication."
