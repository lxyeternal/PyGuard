This is highly suspicious as it implies the execution of arbitrary code without user consent or transparency. The absence of clear documentation and the unusual behavior of running code during installation are strong indicators of potential malicious intent."

The use of obfuscated or potentially malicious domains like .oast.fun suggests data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication. This behavior aligns with typical patterns seen in malware for information theft or remote code execution."
