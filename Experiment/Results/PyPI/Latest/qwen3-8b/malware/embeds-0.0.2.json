It uses `os.system` to run shell commands, which can be dangerous if the command is not properly sanitized. The URL used to fetch the payload is suspicious and may be associated with malicious activity. The script lacks any form of user notification or transparency, making it highly likely that it is designed to install or execute malicious code."
