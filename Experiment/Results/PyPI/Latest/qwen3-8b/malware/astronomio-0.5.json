      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several malicious behaviors. It uses obfuscated strings and base64 decoding to hide its payload, which is then decompressed using lzma and executed dynamically via `exec`. This is a common technique used in malware to evade detection and analysis. The code also includes checks for running in a sandbox or analysis environment, such as checking for debugger presence and system information. The use of `subprocess` and `ctypes` suggests potential for executing arbitrary commands or accessing system resources. Additionally, the code attempts to suppress errors and handle exceptions broadly, which is often used to avoid detection. The presence of hardcoded webhooks and the use of cryptographic libraries (like `cryptography`) further indicate that this code may be used for data exfiltration or command and control communication."
