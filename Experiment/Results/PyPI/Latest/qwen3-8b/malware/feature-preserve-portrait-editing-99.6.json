      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, username, MAC address, and current working directory) and transmits it to hardcoded, suspicious URLs after base64 encoding. It uses obfuscation techniques and lacks transparency, making it highly suspicious. The behavior aligns with information exfiltration and potential remote code execution."
