It also appends a command to modify the user's shell configuration files (.zshrc and .bash_profile) to execute the downloaded script upon login. This constitutes a persistence mechanism and unauthorized modification of system settings. The code does not seek user consent, lacks transparency, and uses potentially suspicious domains, all of which are indicative of malicious behavior."
