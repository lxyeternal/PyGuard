These URLs are not associated with any known legitimate service and appear to be used for data exfiltration. The script also lacks user consent and transparency, and the use of base64 encoding for data transmission is a common technique in malicious activities. The hardcoded URLs and lack of documentation indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent."
