      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains dynamic code execution using exec() with a payload decrypted via Fernet encryption. It uses a custom setuptools install hook to execute the payload during package installation, indicating potential for supply chain attacks. The code also includes hardcoded sensitive data and suspicious variable names, suggesting obfuscation and evasion techniques. Conditional execution based on the operating system further indicates targeted behavior."
