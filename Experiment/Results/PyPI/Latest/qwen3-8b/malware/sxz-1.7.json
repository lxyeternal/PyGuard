      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several malicious behaviors. It uses base64 decoding to decode a payload, which is then executed using the exec function. This is a common technique used in malware to execute arbitrary code and evade detection. The code also attempts to download and execute code from an external URL, which is a classic indicator of remote code execution (RCE) attacks. Additionally, it uses subprocess to execute commands, which can be used for command injection or persistence. The code also attempts to write to files in system directories, which is suspicious. The presence of these features combined with the use of obfuscation techniques strongly indicates that this is malicious code."
