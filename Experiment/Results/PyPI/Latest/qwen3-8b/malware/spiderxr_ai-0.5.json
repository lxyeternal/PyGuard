      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the user's public IP address and detailed geolocation and device information via external APIs without explicit user consent. It then sends this collected information, along with user input and AI-generated responses, to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, effectively exfiltrating potentially sensitive user data to an attacker-controlled Telegram chat. The presence of hardcoded Telegram bot credentials and chat ID used for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code communicates with suspicious hardcoded IP addresses (104.236.72.47) on non-standard ports, which appear to be attacker-controlled endpoints, further indicating potential command-and-control or data exfiltration activity. The code lacks user notification or consent regarding data collection and transmission, and it suppresses exceptions broadly, which can be used to evade detection. These behaviors align with typical patterns of information-stealing malware or spyware, making the code malicious."
