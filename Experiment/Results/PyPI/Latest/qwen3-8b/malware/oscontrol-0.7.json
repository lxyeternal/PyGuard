      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several suspicious characteristics indicative of malicious behavior. The presence of a large, obfuscated payload encoded in base64 suggests the possibility of dynamic execution of arbitrary code, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute payloads. Additionally, the use of `__pyarmor__` indicates that this code may be part of a PyArmor-encrypted script, which is often used for obfuscation and protection of malicious payloads. The code appears to be designed to run in a non-transparent manner, possibly with the intent of exfiltrating data or executing commands without user consent. These factors strongly suggest that the code has malicious intent."
