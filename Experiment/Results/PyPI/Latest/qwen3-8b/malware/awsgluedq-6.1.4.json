It uses a custom post-install hook to execute additional logic, which is often used for persistence or data exfiltration. The hardcoded endpoint and lack of transparency suggest potential malicious intent."

The absence of user consent, error handling, or clear legitimate purpose raises concerns about potential data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication."
