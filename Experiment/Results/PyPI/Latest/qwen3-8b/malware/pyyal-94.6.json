This behavior is commonly associated with malware, particularly in the context of supply chain attacks. The lack of transparency about the purpose of 'main' and the minimal author information also raise red flags."

It uses base64 encoding for data transmission and lacks proper error handling, which are common indicators of data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication. The URLs point to domains that may be associated with malicious activities, further suggesting the presence of malicious intent."
