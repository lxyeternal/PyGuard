      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior. The function 'spider_ai' collects the user's public IP address and queries an external geolocation service to gather additional information about the user's device, country, city, latitude, and longitude. It then composes a message containing the user's input, the AI response, and the collected IP/geolocation information. This message is sent to a hardcoded Telegram bot (with a hardcoded bot token and chat ID) via the Telegram API, exfiltrating potentially sensitive user data to an attacker-controlled endpoint without user consent or notification. This pattern—collecting system/user information and exfiltrating it to a hardcoded remote server (Telegram bot)—is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The use of hardcoded credentials, lack of user notification, and immediate exfiltration of data are strong indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code (Devils_GPT, Worm_GPT) interacts with external servers but does not itself exfiltrate user/system data; however, the presence of the exfiltration logic in 'spider_ai' is sufficient to classify the code as malicious."
