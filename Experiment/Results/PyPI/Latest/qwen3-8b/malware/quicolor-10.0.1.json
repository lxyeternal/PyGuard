      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several suspicious and potentially malicious behaviors. It includes a hidden Telegram backup functionality that attempts to compress and upload user data to a Telegram bot. This involves accessing sensitive directories like 'C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Telegram Desktop\\tdata' and uploading the compressed data to an external server using a hardcoded Telegram bot API key and chat ID. This is a strong indicator of data exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code runs in the background without explicit user consent and may attempt to persist by running in a non-daemon thread. The use of network calls to upload data to an external endpoint without user notification or opt-in is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent."
