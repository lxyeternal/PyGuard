      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses a custom install hook to execute arbitrary code (from the 'main' module) during package installation without user consent or notification. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with known patterns of malicious code, including supply chain attacks and remote code execution. The lack of transparency and the absence of clear documentation further increase the likelihood of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The script sends system information (hostname, username, current working directory) to suspicious domains like 'oast.fun', which are commonly associated with data exfiltration or malicious activity. It lacks user consent or notification, collects sensitive data, and transmits it over the network without clear justification. The use of such domains and the absence of transparent intent strongly indicate malicious behavior."
