      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains several malicious behaviors. It uses base64 decoding to decode a payload, which is then written to a temporary file and executed using subprocess. This is a classic technique used in malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code. The code also attempts to hide its execution by suppressing errors and using dynamic execution through the use of eval or exec functions on decoded data. Additionally, it uses a hardcoded URL to download the payload, which is a common method for remote code execution. The presence of these characteristics strongly indicates that the code is malicious."
