      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from an untrusted external server (http://jacobsandum.com:1337/) using os.system, which is a suspicious behavior. The hostname-based URL construction suggests targeted payload delivery. The lack of user consent or notification for downloading and executing remote content is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the use of a suspicious domain and the absence of clear documentation or legitimate purpose further confirm the presence of potentially malicious behavior."

It uses os.system to execute remote commands, which is a common technique in malicious payloads. The script collects system information and sends it to an untrusted domain, raising significant security concerns."
