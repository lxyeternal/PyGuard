Although the code itself does not contain explicit malicious behavior, the module's name and the absence of transparency suggest it may be used for data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or other malicious activities."

It also includes anti-analysis techniques, network communication with suspicious endpoints, file manipulation, and potential for remote code execution. The script uses obfuscation and dynamic execution to evade detection."
