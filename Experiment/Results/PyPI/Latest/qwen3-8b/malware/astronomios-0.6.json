      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple malicious behaviors. It uses obfuscated strings and base64 decoding to dynamically execute code, which is a common technique used in malware to evade detection. The code attempts to decode and execute a payload using the exec function, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Additionally, it includes complex logic for checking system information, such as platform and environment variables, which could be used to determine if it's running in a sandbox or analysis environment. The use of cryptographic libraries (e.g., AES, ChaCha20) suggests that the code may be encrypting or decrypting data, which is often seen in malware for exfiltration purposes. The code also has an install hook that executes custom logic upon installation, which is a suspicious behavior for benign software. These characteristics collectively indicate that the code is malicious."
