      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded local URL 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/evil' immediately upon import or execution, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. This network request is outside of any function or user-triggered event, indicating automatic execution. Additionally, the code is part of a setup script that defines a package named 'evil-pkg2' with a description 'Just a harmless package :)', which is likely a deceptive attempt to mask malicious intent. Executing network requests during package setup or import is a known hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages that execute code automatically upon installation or import without user consent. Although the URL is localhost, the pattern of automatic network communication in setup scripts is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to trigger local malicious services or exfiltrate data. This behavior aligns with known malicious patterns of executing code during package installation or import to perform unauthorized network communication."
