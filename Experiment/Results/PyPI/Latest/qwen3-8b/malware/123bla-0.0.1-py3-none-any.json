      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious, and non-standard domain (https://baxinmfhrfhljgtfuwec4wgzd6vldrx1g.oast.fun). The domain appears random and is hosted on 'oast.fun', a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and often abused in malicious activities such as data exfiltration or command and control (C2). The code lacks any user interaction, input validation, or legitimate context for this network communication. It immediately sends a request to an attacker-controlled endpoint without any indication of benign purpose. This behavior aligns with typical malicious patterns involving data exfiltration or remote communication with a C2 server, making it a strong indicator of malicious intent."
