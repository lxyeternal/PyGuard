It uses base64 encoding to obscure the data being transmitted, which is a common technique in malware. The script communicates with domains like 'oast.fun' and 'byted-dast.com', which are often associated with data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication. The absence of user consent or notification, combined with the lack of transparency, further indicates malicious intent."
