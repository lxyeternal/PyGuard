      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several malicious behaviors. It uses dynamic code execution via `exec` on base64-decoded data, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary payloads. The script also attempts to run a payload from a remote source using `subprocess`, which can be used for command injection or execution of malicious code. Additionally, it includes functionality to write files to the local system, which could be used for persistence or exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded URLs and use of `os.system` with shell=True further indicates potential for executing arbitrary commands. These are all hallmarks of malicious behavior."
