It then dynamically constructs URLs that appear to be intended for command-and-control (C2) communication, likely using a suspicious domain like 'dnslog.sbs'. The script attempts to resolve these URLs, which could indicate an attempt to establish communication with a remote server. The use of obfuscation, lack of user consent, and the absence of clear legitimate purposes all contribute to the suspicion of malicious intent."
