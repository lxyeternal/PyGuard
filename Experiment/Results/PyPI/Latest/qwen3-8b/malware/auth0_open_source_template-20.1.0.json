      "malicious_behavior": "This code imports and instantiates a SystemTracker object at the top level of the module, causing it to execute immediately upon package import. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages, as it enables code execution without user interaction or awareness. The name 'SystemTracker' strongly suggests system information gathering, and the pattern of initializing such a tracker on import is commonly used in malware to collect and potentially exfiltrate system/user data. Without seeing the implementation of SystemTracker, the intent is highly suspicious, as benign packages rarely perform side-effectful actions (such as tracking or data collection) automatically on import. This pattern matches known malicious behaviors: automatic execution on import, potential for covert data collection, and lack of user notification or consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information, including hostname, local IP address, OS details, installation path, and generates a unique installation ID. Critically, it immediately and automatically sends this data to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/autho) via an HTTP POST request, without any user notification, consent, or legitimate justification. The use of a hardcoded webhook endpoint, silent error suppression, and the automatic execution of data exfiltration upon instantiation are all hallmarks of information-stealing malware. This pattern is exclusively observed in malicious Python samples and is never present in benign code. The code is designed to exfiltrate reconnaissance data to an attacker-controlled server, which can be used for further attacks, tracking, or exploitation. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in standard software."
