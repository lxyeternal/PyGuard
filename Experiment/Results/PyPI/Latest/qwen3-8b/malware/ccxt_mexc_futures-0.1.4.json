      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains a critical malware pattern: it uses a base64-encoded, marshaled Python object (the 'salt' attribute), which is decoded and then executed at runtime via eval(marshal.loads(base64.b64decode(...))). This is a textbook example of obfuscated, dynamic code execution, which is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks. The payload is hidden and only revealed at runtime, making static analysis difficult and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. There is no legitimate reason for a trading API wrapper to execute hidden, marshaled code in this way. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never present in benign code. The rest of the code appears to be a wrapper for the MEXC exchange, but the presence of this obfuscated payload is a severe security risk and indicates malicious intent."
