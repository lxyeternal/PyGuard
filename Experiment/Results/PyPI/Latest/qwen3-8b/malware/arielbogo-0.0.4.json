      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains clear malicious behavior. At the top level, before any legitimate setup logic, it executes a subprocess that runs 'curl' to contact a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/c33c9bd8-baf5-4abd-b3d2-525a1e8dcc2c). This is a classic indicator of malware, especially in the context of a setup.py or installation script, as it causes code execution and network communication during package installation, without user consent or notification. The contacted endpoint (webhook.site) is commonly used for data exfiltration or as a proof-of-execution in supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for a package setup script to make such a network request, especially to an unrelated, hardcoded, and potentially attacker-controlled domain. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, credential theft, or initial access payloads."
