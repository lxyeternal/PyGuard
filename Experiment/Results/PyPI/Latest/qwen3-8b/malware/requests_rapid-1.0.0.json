      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects user and system information (such as username, hostname, IP addresses, and location) during installation and sends it to a hardcoded external server. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration without user consent. The use of a custom install command to trigger this behavior is a common technique in supply chain attacks. Additionally, the server IP address is not associated with any known legitimate service, raising concerns about its purpose."
