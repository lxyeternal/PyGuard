      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several malicious behaviors. It uses dynamic execution through `exec` with data fetched from the internet, which is a common technique used in malware to evade detection and deliver payloads. The use of base64 encoding and decoding suggests that the code may be attempting to obfuscate its payload, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. Additionally, the code attempts to execute commands using `subprocess` with potential for arbitrary code execution, which is a significant security risk. The presence of hardcoded URLs and the ability to write files to the system suggest the possibility of data exfiltration or persistence mechanisms. The overall structure of the code is suspicious and indicative of a malicious payload delivery mechanism."
