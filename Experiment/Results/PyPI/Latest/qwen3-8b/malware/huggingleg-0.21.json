      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior by dynamically executing remote code via `os.system`, downloading a file from an external source (`122.51.221.63`), and running it in the background without user consent. This is a classic pattern for remote code execution (RCE) and payload delivery, often used in malware. The conditional check on the environment variable `'X'` may be used to evade sandbox environments, further indicating malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses os.system to execute a command that downloads a file from an external URL, makes it executable, and runs it in the background. This behavior is indicative of remote code execution (RCE) and potential data exfiltration. The lack of user consent, combined with the execution of an unknown file from an untrusted source, strongly suggests malicious intent."
