      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior. The most critical issue is the use of a highly obfuscated string assigned to the 'salt' variable, which is then dynamically evaluated and executed at runtime via a double eval/compile chain in the 'describe' method: (lambda x: eval(eval(compile(x, \"<string>\", \"eval\"))))(self.salt). The obfuscated string appears to be a hex-encoded Python expression that, when decoded and executed, can perform arbitrary actions, including fetching and executing remote code or data. This pattern—obfuscated payload, dynamic code execution using eval/compile, and potential for remote code execution—is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for a trading API wrapper to use such obfuscation and dynamic code execution. This code could easily be used to download and execute malicious payloads, steal credentials, or perform other unauthorized actions on the host system. The rest of the code appears to be a wrapper for the MEXC exchange API, but the presence of this obfuscated, dynamically executed code makes the entire package highly suspicious and dangerous."
