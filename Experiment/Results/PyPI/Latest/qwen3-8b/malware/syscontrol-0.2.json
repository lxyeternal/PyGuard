      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior in the Subsys.status method. Specifically, it uses obfuscated, base64-encoded code that is decoded and executed at runtime via exec and compile. The decoded payload writes a Python script to a temporary file, which downloads and executes further code from a hardcoded external IP address (http://45.142.115.225:8000/inject/DaTTDxiSvq9OA6r). It then attempts to execute this file, replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe' in the filename, and suppresses errors. This pattern matches multiple critical malware indicators: (1) use of base64 obfuscation to hide payloads, (2) dynamic code execution via exec/compile, (3) downloading and executing code from a suspicious, hardcoded remote endpoint, (4) use of temporary files for payload delivery, and (5) error suppression to evade detection. These behaviors are hallmarks of Python malware, including remote code execution, potential data exfiltration, and supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a benign library."
