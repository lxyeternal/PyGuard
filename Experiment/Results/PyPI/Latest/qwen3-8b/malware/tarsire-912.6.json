      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses an installation hook (setuptools) to execute arbitrary code (main()) during the installation process without user consent. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows for stealthy execution of potentially harmful operations. The lack of documentation, transparency, and clear legitimate purpose further supports this assessment."

It lacks clear purpose, uses potentially malicious domains, and transmits data to untrusted endpoints, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration or command-and-control activities."
