      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during package installation to retrieve an access token from a Google Compute Engine metadata server and sends it to a webhook endpoint. This behavior is suspicious due to the lack of user consent, the use of a hardcoded webhook URL, and the potential for data exfiltration. The custom command is attached to multiple setuptools commands (install, develop, egg_info), which means it will be executed during various package lifecycle events, increasing the risk of unauthorized data transmission."
