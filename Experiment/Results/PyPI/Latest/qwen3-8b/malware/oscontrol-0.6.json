      "malicious_behavior": "The code is malicious and exhibits several characteristics typical of malware. It includes obfuscated payloads encoded in base64 and zlib-compressed strings, which are dynamically decoded and executed using `exec`. This is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade detection and analysis. The presence of `pyarmor_runtime_000000` suggests the code is obfuscated or encrypted for anti-analysis purposes. Additionally, it appears to be part of a package installation hook, which may be used for persistence or payload delivery. The use of dynamic execution (`exec`) on decoded data further confirms the malicious intent."
