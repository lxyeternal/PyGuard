It uses PowerShell commands to perform these actions, which is a common technique in malware for evading detection and executing payloads. The use of a Discord-like CDN (GitHub) and the lack of transparency about the purpose of the downloaded file further increase the risk. The script also modifies the standard install command in setuptools, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks."
