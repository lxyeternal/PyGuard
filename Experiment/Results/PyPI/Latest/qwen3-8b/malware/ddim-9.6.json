It uses base64 encoding for data transmission, which is often used to obfuscate payloads. The script also executes system commands via subprocess to gather information, which is a common technique in malware for reconnaissance. The lack of user consent or notification, combined with the use of suspicious domains, further supports the presence of malicious intent."
