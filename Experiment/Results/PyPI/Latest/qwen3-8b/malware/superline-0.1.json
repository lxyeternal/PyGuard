      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It includes hardcoded Discord webhook URLs for exfiltration, dynamic code execution using eval and exec, and attempts to bypass UAC and other security measures. The code also steals sensitive data such as browser credentials, cookies, passwords, and system information, and sends it to a remote server. Additionally, it uses obfuscation techniques, suppresses errors, and tries to hide its presence by modifying the registry and creating persistence in startup folders. The use of base64 encoding and zlib compression for payloads is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade detection."
