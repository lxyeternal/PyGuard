The use of PowerShell to download and execute the file, along with the lack of user notification or error handling, further supports this conclusion."

This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves downloading and running an external file without user consent, which is a common tactic used in malware delivery. The use of a GitHub raw link for hosting the file also increases the risk, as it may be used to distribute malicious payloads."
