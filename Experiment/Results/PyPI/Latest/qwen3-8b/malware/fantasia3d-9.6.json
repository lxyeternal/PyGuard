This behavior is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent, which is a common technique used in malware to achieve persistence, exfiltrate data, or deliver payloads. The lack of clear documentation or legitimate purpose for this execution further increases the risk."

It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate data, suppresses errors, and lacks user consent or notification, all of which are indicative of malicious behavior."
