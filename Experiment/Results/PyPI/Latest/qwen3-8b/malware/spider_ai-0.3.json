      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several strong indicators of malicious behavior. It sends user-supplied data (including potentially sensitive text, API keys, and model names) to hardcoded external IP addresses (104.236.72.47) over HTTP, which is a hallmark of data exfiltration and command-and-control (C2) communication. The endpoints and headers are hardcoded and do not belong to any well-known, trusted service, further increasing suspicion. The function names (e.g., 'Devils_GPT', 'Worm_GPT', 'spider_ai') and the inclusion of a Telegram handle in the response suggest association with known malicious AI-themed malware campaigns. The code does not notify the user that their data is being sent to an external server, and the use of broad try/except blocks suppresses errors, which is a common evasion technique. There is no legitimate justification for transmitting API keys or user input to these endpoints, and the code structure matches patterns observed in information-stealing and C2 malware. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."
