It exfiltrates this data to hardcoded Discord webhooks for remote storage and monitoring. It also uses obfuscation techniques, dynamic execution, and network communication to evade detection and operate stealthily. The code scans various user directories and browser profiles to extract sensitive information, which is then uploaded to external servers."
