      "malicious_behavior": "The code establishes a network connection to a remote server and executes commands received from that server, sending the output back. This behavior is indicative of a remote access tool (RAT) or backdoor, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine without user consent. The code lacks clear documentation or legitimate purpose, and the use of subprocess with shell=True poses a significant security risk. The potential for data exfiltration and unauthorized access makes this code highly suspicious and likely malicious."
