      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It prompts the user to enter 12 'seed phrases' (commonly used as sensitive credentials in cryptocurrency wallets) under the guise of 'authorization'. It then immediately exfiltrates these sensitive phrases to a hardcoded Telegram chat via the Telegram Bot API, using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. This is a classic pattern of credential theft and data exfiltration, matching multiple critical risk indicators: (1) harvesting sensitive user input, (2) immediate transmission to an attacker-controlled endpoint, (3) use of hardcoded credentials and endpoints, and (4) lack of legitimate justification for collecting or transmitting such data. There is no legitimate reason for a program to collect 12 seed phrases and send them to a remote server in this manner. This behavior is exclusively observed in malware, particularly in cryptocurrency wallet stealers."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code imports a function or object 'a' from a local module 'csjkdc' and immediately executes it via a(). This pattern is highly suspicious and is a hallmark of malicious Python packages, especially in supply chain attacks. The use of a single-letter, non-descriptive function name and a non-standard module name suggests obfuscation or an attempt to evade detection. Critically, the code executes arbitrary logic upon import or execution, without any user interaction, input validation, or documentation. This is a common technique used by malware to trigger payloads during package installation or import, enabling data exfiltration, remote code execution, or other malicious actions. Without the source of 'csjkdc.a', the intent cannot be confirmed as benign, and the pattern matches those observed exclusively in malware samples. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious until the contents of 'csjkdc.a' are proven otherwise."
