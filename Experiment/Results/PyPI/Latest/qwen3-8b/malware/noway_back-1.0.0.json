      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom setuptools install command (class N) that overrides the run() method to execute a function (test) during package installation. The test() function uses zipimport and importlib to dynamically load and execute a module from a local file named 'zip.zip', and then calls a function hello() from that module. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine at install time, without user consent or notification. The use of a zip archive to hide and execute code is a common obfuscation technique in malware, allowing the attacker to conceal the true payload from static analysis. There is no legitimate reason for a setup.py to execute code from a bundled zip file during installation, and this pattern is never observed in benign packages. The code does not validate or restrict what is inside 'zip.zip', so any arbitrary (potentially malicious) code could be executed. This is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware."
