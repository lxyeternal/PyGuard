It also attempts to install a package at runtime without clear user consent. The use of obfuscated variable names and dynamic construction of paths suggests an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors are commonly associated with malicious code."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It includes dynamic code execution using `exec` and `eval`, which are often used to execute arbitrary code from obfuscated or encoded sources. The presence of base64 decoding suggests that the code may be attempting to hide its payload or exfiltrate data. Additionally, the use of network-related functions like `requests.get` indicates potential data exfiltration or communication with a command-and-control server. The code also appears to be designed for persistence by potentially modifying system settings or files. These behaviors are commonly associated with malware, including information stealers, remote access trojans (RATs), and other types of malicious payloads."

It includes dynamic execution using eval and exec, which are often used to execute arbitrary code. The presence of base64 decoding suggests that the code may be attempting to hide its payload or exfiltrate data. There are also network-related functions that could be used to communicate with remote servers, potentially for command and control (C2) purposes. The code appears to be designed for data collection and transmission, which is a common feature in malware. Additionally, the code has obfuscated variable names and uses techniques to evade detection, such as suppressing errors and hiding its intent. These characteristics strongly suggest that the code is malicious."
