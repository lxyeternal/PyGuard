This is a clear example of data exfiltration. Additionally, the code is designed to execute this behavior during package installation via a custom install command, which is a common technique for persistence and stealth. The lack of user notification, absence of security measures, and use of a hardcoded remote endpoint strongly indicate malicious intent."
