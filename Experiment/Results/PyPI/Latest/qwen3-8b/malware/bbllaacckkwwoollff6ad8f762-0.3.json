      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses a custom install hook to execute arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. It reads sensitive files from /run/secrets/ and sends them to an external server using HTTP PUT requests. The data is encoded in base64, which is often used to obfuscate payloads. The code also lacks transparency and user notification, making it highly suspicious of being a data exfiltration or credential theft tool."
