      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious behavior where it triggers a network request to a decoded webhook URL during package installation. The webhook URL is encoded and decoded using a Caesar cipher, indicating an attempt to obfuscate the destination. The script collects system information (such as the host user) and sends it to the webhook URL, which could be used for data exfiltration. The use of an installation hook to execute this behavior without user consent is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack. Additionally, the lack of transparency and the obfuscation techniques used are consistent with malicious intent."
