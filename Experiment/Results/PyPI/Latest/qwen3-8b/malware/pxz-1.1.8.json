This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation process via the on_install function linked in the setup entry_points, which triggers the collect_system_info function. The use of a hardcoded external server for data exfiltration during installation, combined with the silent collection of system information, is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate justification or user interaction for this behavior, and the code is embedded in the package setup script, which is a common vector for malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
