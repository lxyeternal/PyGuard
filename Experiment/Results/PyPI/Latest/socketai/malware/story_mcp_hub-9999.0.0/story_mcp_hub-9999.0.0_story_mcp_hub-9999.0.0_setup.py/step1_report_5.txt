{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to install a Python package and execute a custom installation process that sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends data to an external URL, which could potentially leak sensitive environment information.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, user) from sources flows into the requests.get() request, transmitting data to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request during installation without user consent or obvious necessity, and the URL appears suspicious and external. The version number and author details suggest malicious intent. The comment hints at using this for spying or command-and-control purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a third-party library (requests). It defines a custom install command that, after performing the normal installation, collects system info and sends it to an external URL. The data transmission occurs during the installation process, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL used is obscure, and the purpose is not typical for open-source packages. The code does not sanitize or validate data before sending, and no user confirmation or notification is present. The overall structure indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system info covertly during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly transmitting system information to an external server during installation. The intent appears to be espionage or tracking, which makes it highly suspicious and potentially harmful if used in production environments.",
