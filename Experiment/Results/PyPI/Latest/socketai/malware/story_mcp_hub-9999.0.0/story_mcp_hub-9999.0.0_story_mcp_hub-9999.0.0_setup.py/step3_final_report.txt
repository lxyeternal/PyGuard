{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system information during package installation by sending hostname, current working directory, and username to an external URL, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are collected in run(), then sent via requests.get() to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during setup without user consent, author labeled 'attacker', high version number, suspicious URL",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after installation, collects hostname, cwd, and username, then sends this data to an external URL. The author label and high version number suggest malicious intent. The external URL is suspicious, and the data exfiltration occurs silently during installation, which is characteristic of supply chain attacks. No obfuscation is present. The behavior is straightforward and clearly malicious, with no logical errors. The external URL is used as a data exfiltration endpoint, and the code operates without user awareness. The activity poses a high security risk, including potential data theft and covert surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. The author label and high version number reinforce malicious intent. The external URL is suspicious. Overall, this package is a supply chain security threat and should be considered malicious.",
