{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, executes a custom installation process which sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom installation process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected data to an external URL, which can be considered a data exfiltration sink.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, user) is gathered during the install run and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code silently transmits system information to an external server without user consent, which is unusual for a setup script. The server URL appears obfuscated or malicious, and the package's metadata labels the author as 'attacker' and uses an abnormally high version number to override internal versions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for setup and system info collection. The CustomInstall class overrides the run method to execute the normal installation process and then collects hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL with these parameters, which indicates data exfiltration. The URL used is suspicious and likely malicious, as it appears obfuscated and is intended to send system info to an unknown server. The setup configuration uses suspicious metadata, including a high version number and author labeled as 'attacker', further implying malicious intent. This pattern is typical of supply chain attacks aiming to stealthily collect and transmit user system data during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation. The setup script is designed to operate covertly, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The overall security risk is significant due to this data leakage.",
