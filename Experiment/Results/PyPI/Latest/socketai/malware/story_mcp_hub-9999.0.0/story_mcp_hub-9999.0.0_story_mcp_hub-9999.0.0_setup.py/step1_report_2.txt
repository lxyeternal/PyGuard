{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, sends system information to an external server, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The data is read from socket (hostname), os (current working directory), and getpass (username).",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data over the network to an external URL, which could be used for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username) is collected from sources and sent via an HTTP GET request to the specified external URL during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and is likely malicious. The code gathers system info silently during package installation without user consent. The use of high version number and author name 'attacker' suggests malicious intent. The code embeds network activity in a setup script, which is uncommon and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a custom installation class that, after completing the normal installation, collects system info such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to an external URL. The external URL appears malicious, used for tracking or data collection without user awareness. The setup configuration specifies no dependencies and overwrites standard package details, with an intentionally high version number and author name indicating malicious intent. The network activity embedded within the setup process is highly unusual and suspicious, pointing toward potential data theft or covert tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external server, indicating a supply chain attack or backdoor. The URL and author info further confirm malicious intent. This package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
