{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup with a custom installation step that sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - gather hostname, current working directory, and username",
  "sinks": "requests.get() - sending collected system data to external URL",
  "flows": "source data (hostname, cwd, username) -> external HTTP GET request to a third-party server",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class collects system information and exfiltrates it without user consent or disclosure, which is suspicious. The URL used appears to be a third-party or potentially malicious endpoint. No other legitimate purpose is evident for this data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package called 'story-mcp-hub'. It overrides the install command to include a request to an external URL, sending system info such as hostname, current directory, and username. The URL appears to be a suspicious, possibly malicious domain (oastify.com is known for security testing, but its usage here could be malicious). The data exfiltration occurs during installation, which is hidden behavior and likely malicious intent. There are no input validation or user prompts, and the data transmission occurs automatically during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The use of an external server and hidden data transmission points to potential malicious activity or data theft.",
