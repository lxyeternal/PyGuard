{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that executes a custom installation routine, which collects system information and sends it to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()) during the custom install run method.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.get() to an external domain during installation.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, user) are sent directly to the external URL via requests.get() within the CustomInstall.run() method.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes the collection of system info and its transmission to an external server during package installation. The URL appears suspicious, and the author is named 'attacker', indicating malicious intent. No legitimate reason for data exfiltration is provided.",
  "analysis": "The script leverages setuptools to define package installation behavior, with a custom class that overrides the run() method. During installation, it collects hostname, current directory, and username. Instead of typical installation steps, it makes a GET request to an external domain, passing the collected data as parameters. This behavior suggests tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not include any obfuscation, but the use of an external tracking URL and the naming conventions point toward malicious intent. The data collection occurs unconditionally during installation, which is suspicious. The URL itself resembles a malicious or at least suspicious external server, likely used for exfiltration or command and control.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate system information during package installation. The intent appears to be to track or spy on users without their consent, using the setup process as a covert data collection point. It should be considered highly dangerous.",
