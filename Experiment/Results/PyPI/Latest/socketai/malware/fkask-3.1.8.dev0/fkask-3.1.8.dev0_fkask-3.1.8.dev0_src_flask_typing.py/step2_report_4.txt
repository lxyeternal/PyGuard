  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of type aliases and type variables for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug.\n- They consistently state that the code is static type annotations, with no runtime logic, data processing, or handling of untrusted input.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code features are identified.\n- The code relies on standard Python typing features, conditional imports for type checking, and union types to define response and callback signatures.\n- All reports assign a confidence level of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Confirmations & Validations:**\n- The code does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or potential vulnerabilities.\n- The type annotations are consistent, well-structured, and typical for a framework setup.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code's purpose is to facilitate static type checking, not runtime behavior.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n- None detected. The assessments are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final Expert Judgment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of type definitions for a web framework.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is purely for static type checking, with no malicious or security concern. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
