  "purpose": "Define type aliases and type variables for Flask/Werkzeug web framework to specify expected response and request handler signatures and related types.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (typing) and conditional imports from Flask/Werkzeug modules for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data processing points involving untrusted input data; mainly type annotations and aliases.",
  "flows": "Type annotations and aliases facilitate static type checking but do not execute code or handle runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code consists solely of type definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type aliases for response values, headers, and Flask-related callback signatures. The conditional imports ensure type checking without affecting runtime. No data is read from or written to external sources, and no untrusted data flows are present. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely type annotation setup for Flask/Werkzeug, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe and standard for type hinting purposes.",
