{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and type aliases for various HTTP response and request handling components in a web framework, likely for Flask or Werkzeug.",
  "sources": "None of the sources read untrusted input or perform data processing; they primarily establish type signatures.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or performs sensitive operations. No output or data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "Type definitions set up data structures and function signatures but do not implement runtime logic; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is standard for type hinting purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes type aliases and type variables to facilitate static type checking of a web framework, with conditional imports for type hints and detailed union types for HTTP response components. It uses standard Python typing features without executing runtime logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is purely type annotation setup code intended for static type checking, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process or handle runtime data and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
