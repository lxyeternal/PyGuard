  "purpose": "Type alias and type variable definitions for a web application framework, specifically for handling HTTP responses, headers, middleware, and route functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type annotations, and type variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "Type annotations and variable assignments, which do not process or handle untrusted data at runtime.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static type definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The import statements are standard for type hinting. No code executes or manipulates data; all is static typing setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliasing, type variables, and import statements used for static type checking. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or data processing occurs. There are no suspicious functions, data leaks, or malicious constructs. The imports are for type annotations, and all definitions are conventional for a web framework’s typing system. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type definitions for a web framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely facilitates static type checking and does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.",
