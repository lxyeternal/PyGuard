  "purpose": "Define type aliases, type variables, and callback signatures for static type checking in a Flask/Werkzeug web framework context.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports for type checking, type alias definitions, and type variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only static type annotations without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs in this static setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward type alias and variable definitions with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations for response types, headers, and callback signatures used in a web framework. It imports types conditionally for type checking purposes and defines various union types to facilitate type hints. There are no runtime operations, data processing, or handling of untrusted input. The code is well-structured, commented, and standard for static type setup in Python web projects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with its benign, purely static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of static type annotations for a Flask/Werkzeug application. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect its safe, non-executable purpose.",
