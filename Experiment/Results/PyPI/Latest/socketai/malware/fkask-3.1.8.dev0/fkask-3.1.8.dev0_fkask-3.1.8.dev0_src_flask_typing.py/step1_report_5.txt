{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and callable signatures for a web framework, likely for Flask or Werkzeug, to facilitate type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imports at the beginning of the code; variable definitions and type unions throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code primarily consists of type definitions and imports, with no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only establishes type annotations without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code uses standard type hints and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various type aliases and Union types for response values, headers, and callback functions in a web framework context. It includes conditional imports for type checking purposes, using 'typing.TYPE_CHECKING'. All type definitions seem consistent and appropriate for framework annotations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic. The code appears to be standard, well-structured type hinting for a Flask/Werkzeug project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotations and does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious logic. It is a typical setup for a web framework's type safety and does not pose any security threat.",
