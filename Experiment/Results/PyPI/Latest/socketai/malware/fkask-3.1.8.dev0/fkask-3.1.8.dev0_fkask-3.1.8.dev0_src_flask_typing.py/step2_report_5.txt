  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type alias definitions, type variables, and conditional imports aimed at static type checking.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, input handling, or security-sensitive functions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type annotation setup for a web framework like Flask or Werkzeug.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches typical patterns for type annotations in Flask/Werkzeug projects. No errors or anomalies are evident.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used.\n- **Security risks:** Since the code is purely static type definitions, it does not introduce runtime vulnerabilities or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and well-commented.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 or below, since the code is purely for type hinting and does not impact runtime security.\n\n**However,** the reports uniformly assign a risk score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. No reason to increase this score.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- Some reports mention \"potential vulnerabilities\" or \"data flow\" concerns, but these are unfounded given the static nature of the code.\n- No claims are made about runtime data handling or untrusted data processing, so the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal static typing complexity, but 0 is appropriate)\n\n**Overall,** the code is benign, standard for static type annotations, and presents no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                         |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Clear, straightforward type alias definitions.                 |\n| Security Risk   | 0                 | Purely static type annotations with no runtime impact.        |\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any security threat.",
