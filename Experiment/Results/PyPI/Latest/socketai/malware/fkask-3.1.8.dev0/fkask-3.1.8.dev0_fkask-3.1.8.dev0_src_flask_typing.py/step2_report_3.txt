  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of type aliases, type variables, and conditional imports aimed at static type checking.\n- There are no runtime operations, data processing, or handling of untrusted input.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code is well-structured, with comprehensive comments explaining the purpose of each type alias.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's static, non-executable nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None.\n- **Handling of untrusted data or sensitive operations:** None.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious constructs:** None.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None, as the code is purely type annotation setup.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is straightforward and well-commented.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified, since the code doesn't perform any runtime operations, data handling, or security-critical functions.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n- No report suggests any reason to elevate the risk or malware scores.\n- The detailed comments and type annotations serve as static checks, not runtime logic, further reducing any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Potential for Higher Scores?\n\n- Given the code's nature, even if some reports had assigned a risk score of 0.5, that would be unwarranted.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as there's no malicious intent or behavior.\n- Obfuscation remains at 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, purely static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this code as safe, with no malicious or security risk elements. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
