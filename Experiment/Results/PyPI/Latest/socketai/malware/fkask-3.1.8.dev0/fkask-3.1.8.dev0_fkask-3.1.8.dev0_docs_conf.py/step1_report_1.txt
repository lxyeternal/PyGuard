  "purpose": "Configuration script for generating Flask project documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import statements, get_version() call, github_link() function, setup() function.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct sinks that handle untrusted data; URLs are constructed from controlled variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; version retrieval is from a local function, URL construction uses fixed strings and controlled variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of packaging.version.parse() to determine release type; dynamic URL generation in github_link() based on version info. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles configuration and URL construction for documentation. It imports necessary modules, retrieves version info, and constructs GitHub URLs dynamically based on version data. There are no indications of data input from untrusted sources, malicious code, or backdoors. Functions are straightforward and do not perform unsafe operations. The dynamic URL generation depends on version parsing but uses only controlled variables and standard library functions. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or malware-like activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely constructs URLs and manages documentation settings without handling untrusted data or executing suspicious operations.",
