  "sinks": "Constructed URLs for GitHub links in github_link function",
  "flows": "release/version data → github_link URL construction",
  "anomalies": "None; URL construction relies solely on internal, controlled variables without untrusted input",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info, constructs URLs for GitHub source links based on release version, and defines helper functions for documentation. No untrusted data handling, secrets, or malicious code are present. URL generation depends on internal release data, which is safe. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The dynamic URL creation is standard practice and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard configuration for Sphinx documentation with safe URL generation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The slight risk score of 0.1 assigned in some reports is justified by the dynamic URL creation but does not indicate any security concern.",
