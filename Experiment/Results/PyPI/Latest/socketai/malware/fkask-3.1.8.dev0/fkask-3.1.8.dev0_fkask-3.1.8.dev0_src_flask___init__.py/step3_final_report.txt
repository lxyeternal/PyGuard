{
  "purpose": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules related to a web framework, likely Flask, serving as setup or configuration code.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules such as .app, .blueprints, .config, .ctx, .globals, .helpers, .signals, .templating, and .wrappers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external communication, or data processing occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules; there are no data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; standard import statements with no secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements establishing framework components for a web application. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The minimal risk score reflects the inherent risk in module imports but does not indicate any malicious intent or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing standard framework setup code with no malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
