{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a collection of import statements for various modules and functions, likely part of a larger framework or library, possibly Flask or a similar web framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from local package files (e.g., .app, .blueprints, .config, .ctx, .globals, .helpers, .signals, .templating, .wrappers).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network, file, or sensitive data operations are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—no data flow from sources to sinks detected; the code only imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual constructs. The code is a straightforward import declaration block.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements importing various functions and classes from local modules. There are no operations, data processing, or control flow constructs. It resembles the initialization or setup of a web framework component. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security-sensitive anomalies are present. The absence of any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of import statements likely for a web framework, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It is benign and typical for setting up module dependencies.",
