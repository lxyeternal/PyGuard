  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard import statements from internal modules related to a web framework, likely Flask.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No processing of untrusted data or external communication.  \n- **Anomalies:** No unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely import statements for framework components, with no malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard internal module imports.  \n- No data flow or suspicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion confirms it's a typical framework setup.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Again, straightforward imports from local modules related to web app features.  \n- No data processing or external communication.  \n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same pattern: import statements from internal modules.  \n- No data flow, no suspicious activity.  \n- Conclusion supports benign intent.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Similar import statements, standard for web framework setup.  \n- No data handling or suspicious code.  \n- Conclusion confirms safety.  \n- Scores: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is only import statements, with no execution of untrusted code, network activity, or data exfiltration. **Malware score should remain 0 across all reports.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation patterns, encrypted code, or suspicious code structures are present. All are straightforward import statements. **Obfuscated score should be 0.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** The minimal risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature. Since the code only performs imports, the risk is negligible. A slight increase to 0.1 in some reports reflects the minimal inherent risk in module imports, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Maintain malware = 0** for all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Maintain obfuscated = 0** for all reports, as code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk scores** can stay at 0.1 or 0, reflecting the low but non-zero inherent risk of importing modules (e.g., potential for future misuse if modules are compromised, but not evident here).\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is standard framework setup code with no security concerns. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores for this code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
