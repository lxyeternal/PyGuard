{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like web framework, enabling modular app development with static file serving and resource management.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from current_app.config, receives filename and resource parameters as method inputs, and accesses self attributes like static_folder and root_path.",
  "sinks": "Uses send_from_directory to serve static files, open() calls for resource files, and accesses configuration values. No direct data leaks or unsafe code observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration values flow from current_app.config to get_send_file_max_age; filename parameters flow into get_send_file_max_age and send_static_file; resource parameter flows into open_resource, which opens files based on root_path and resource.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. Use of open() with paths based on parameters could be risky if inputs are untrusted, but this is standard resource access. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles static file serving and resource file opening within a web framework. It reads configuration settings and method parameters, and then uses standard library functions like open() and send_from_directory to serve files. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All inputs are handled via parameters or configuration values without suspicious manipulations. No code injection, secret theft, or network connections are present. The code appears to be legitimate framework code with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is standard framework utility code for serving static and resource files. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose is legitimate, with no signs of malware, data leaks, or obfuscated content.",
