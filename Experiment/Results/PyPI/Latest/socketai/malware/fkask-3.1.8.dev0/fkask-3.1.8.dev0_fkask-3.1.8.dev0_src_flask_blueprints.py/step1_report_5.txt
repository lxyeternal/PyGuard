{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Blueprint class for a web framework, extending the functionality of an existing blueprint class to include static file handling, resource opening, and app configuration interactions.",
  "sources": "Configuration settings (current_app.config['SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT']), method parameters (filename, resource, mode, encoding), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function call, open() calls for resource files.",
  "flows": "Configuration value flows from current_app.config to get_send_file_max_age; filename parameter flows into get_send_file_max_age and send_from_directory; resource parameter flows into open().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code primarily handles file serving and resource access with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a blueprint class, adding methods for static file handling and resource access. It retrieves cache control settings from a global configuration and uses safe methods for file opening, with input validation for modes. No external data sources, untrusted inputs, or suspicious code execution mechanisms are evident. The send_static_file method calls send_from_directory with controlled parameters. The open_resource method restricts modes to reading only, minimizing risks. Overall, the code appears to be standard web framework utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical extension of a web framework's blueprint class, focused on static file serving and resource management. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It adheres to safe practices and proper input validation. Overall, it presents a low security risk with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
