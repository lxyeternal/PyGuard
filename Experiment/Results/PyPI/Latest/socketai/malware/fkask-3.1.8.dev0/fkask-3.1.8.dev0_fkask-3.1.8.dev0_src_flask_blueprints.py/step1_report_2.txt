{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like web framework, extending functionality for static files, resource opening, and CLI command grouping.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (current_app.config), imported modules, class constructor parameters, method parameters, and the filesystem via os.path and open().",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access via open(), returning file objects; potential data leakage through open resource files; configuration access via current_app.config; no network or external communication is directly involved.",
  "flows": "Configuration data from current_app.config flows into get_send_file_max_age(). File paths from resource and filename parameters flow into open() calls in open_resource(). Static files served via send_from_directory() with filename and static_folder.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code appears to implement standard Flask-like functionality with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no credential handling, or secret exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of SansioBlueprint, adding methods for static file handling and resource management, which are standard features in web frameworks. It accesses configuration values from current_app.config without manipulating untrusted input. Files are opened in read-only modes with no data modification or network communication. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure and usage follow typical patterns for web framework components, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a custom blueprint class for static file serving and resource management in a web framework. It contains no malicious behaviors, no suspicious anomalies, and follows expected patterns for such functionality. It appears safe based on the provided code.",
