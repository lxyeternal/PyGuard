{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Flask blueprint class that extends SansioBlueprint, integrating static file handling, resource opening, and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from current_app.config; reads static files via send_from_directory; reads resource files from the filesystem using os.path.join and open.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function, open() calls for resource files, and access to current_app.config['SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT'].",
  "flows": "Configuration values (source) influence cache max age (sink); filename inputs influence static file serving; resource paths influence file opening.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, code injection, or secret leaks observed. The code primarily manages static file serving and resource access.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Flask blueprint extension that manages static file serving, resource file access, and cache control based on app configuration. It reads configuration for cache max age and static folder paths, serving files via send_from_directory and open. The methods enforce safe practices like checking static folder existence and validating resource mode. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or anomalous code behavior are detected. No external network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears standard for a Flask extension with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask blueprint subclass designed for static file serving and resource access. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. No indicators of malware or suspicious anomalies are found.",
