{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like web framework, managing static files, resources, and CLI commands, with configuration access and filesystem interactions.",
  "sources": "Configuration values (current_app.config), filesystem paths (self.root_path, static_folder), function parameters (filename, resource, mode).",
  "sinks": "File open operations (open), send_from_directory function, configuration access, response return for static files.",
  "flows": "Configuration values influence cache max-age; filename and static_folder determine file serving; open_resource reads files; send_static_file serves static content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; standard filesystem and configuration access; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of a Flask blueprint, handling static files and resources with proper validation and configuration access. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The filesystem access is parameterized but safely handled. No external network activity or sensitive data leaks are evident. The code follows standard practices and does not introduce security risks beyond typical filesystem interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of a web framework utility class with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
