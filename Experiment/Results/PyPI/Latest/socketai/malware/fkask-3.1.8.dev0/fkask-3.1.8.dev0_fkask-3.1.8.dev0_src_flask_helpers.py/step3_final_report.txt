{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for Flask applications, including environment variable checks, response creation, URL generation, file serving, and session message flashing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., FLASK_DEBUG, FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV), request context, session data, template modules, file paths for send_file/send_from_directory.",
  "sinks": "Response objects, session storage, URL endpoints, file output streams, flashed message storage.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence debug/load settings; request/session data flow into response and flashing functions; file paths flow into send_file functions; URL parameters flow into url_for and redirect functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Usage of environment variables and file serving relies on standard Flask/werkzeug mechanisms, which are secure.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard Flask utility functions that handle environment configurations, response creation, URL building, file serving, and message flashing. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. File serving functions depend on Werkzeug's security measures, and environment variables are used appropriately. The code structure is clear, with no signs of covert or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, well-structured Flask utility module with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
