  "purpose": "Provides testing utilities for Flask applications, including custom test client, environment builder, and CLI runner.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules, app configuration, environment variables, and request data via Flask's test request contexts and environment builders.",
  "sinks": "Uses request and response objects, environment data, and configuration data; no data is directly written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input data from test requests and environment configurations flow through request/response cycles within Flask testing contexts; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies on standard libraries and Flask/Werkzeug mechanisms for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom environment builder, Flask test client, and CLI runner, all intended for testing Flask apps. The code leverages standard testing frameworks and Flask's internal mechanisms. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious modifications are observed. The code appears to be well-structured testing utilities without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of testing utilities for Flask applications, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard libraries and Flask testing patterns, and does not include any suspicious or harmful code.",
