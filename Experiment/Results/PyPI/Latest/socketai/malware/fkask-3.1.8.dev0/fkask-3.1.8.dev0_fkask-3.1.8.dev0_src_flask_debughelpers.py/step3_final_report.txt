{
  "purpose": "Provides debugging utilities, custom exceptions, and error reporting for request handling and template loading in a web framework, likely Flask.",
  "sources": "Request data (request.files, request.form), loader attributes, request context, and internal variables during template attempts.",
  "sinks": "Raising custom exceptions, modifying request.files.__class__, logging loader info and template attempts.",
  "flows": "Data is read from request objects and loader attributes, flows into exception raising, class patching, and logging functions.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic patching of request.files.__class__ for better error messages, detailed logging that could leak internal info, but these are standard debugging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for debugging and error reporting, with custom exceptions and dynamic class patching to improve error messages. No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The class patching is a known pattern in Flask for better error diagnostics. The detailed logs could potentially leak internal paths but are typical in debugging contexts. All signals point to benign utility code intended for development and debugging, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging utility with no malicious intent or behavior. The dynamic class patching and detailed logging are standard debugging techniques. No evidence of malware or malicious sabotage is present.",
