  "purpose": "Defines class-based views for a web framework, enabling request dispatching, method handling, and decorator application.",
  "sources": "request.method, class attributes (methods, decorators, view_class), imported globals (current_app, request).",
  "sinks": "Calls to current_app.ensure_sync with dispatch methods, attribute assignments, decorator applications.",
  "flows": "request.method → dispatch_request method → class method (get/post/etc.) → ensure_sync wrapping.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard pattern for class-based views, with dynamic method dispatching, decorator support, and async compatibility via ensure_sync. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The use of class attributes and method wrapping aligns with common web framework practices. No obfuscation or backdoors are evident. The code is readable, structured, and follows expected patterns for such components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of class-based views in a web framework, with no signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
