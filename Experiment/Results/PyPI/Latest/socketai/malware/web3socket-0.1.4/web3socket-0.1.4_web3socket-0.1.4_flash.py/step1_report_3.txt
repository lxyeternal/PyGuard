{
  "purpose": "To start a Web3 socket server that includes a Flash policy server, primarily for WebSocket communication.",
  "sources": "Importing FlashPolicyServer from web3socket.policyserver, instantiating the server, and starting it.",
  "sinks": "server.start() and server.serve_forever() potentially open network ports and start listening for incoming connections.",
  "flows": "The script initializes and starts the policy server, which listens for WebSocket connections on specified host and port.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The comment suggests that the server is only for Flash policy purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a policy server class and instantiates it with noisy logging enabled. It then starts the server and outputs the listening address to standard error. The server runs indefinitely, handling incoming requests. No data is read from untrusted sources within this script, nor are there any suspicious data flows or malicious code execution. The primary function is to serve a Flash policy file, which is a common necessity for legacy Flash WebSocket clients. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script simply initiates a Flash policy server for WebSocket connections, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is a standard server startup script with no suspicious anomalies.",
