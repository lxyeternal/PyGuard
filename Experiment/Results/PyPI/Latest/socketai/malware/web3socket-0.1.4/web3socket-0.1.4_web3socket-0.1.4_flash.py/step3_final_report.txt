{
  "purpose": "Starts a FlashPolicyServer to serve cross-domain policy files for WebSocket or Flash clients.",
  "sources": "Imports from web3socket.policyserver; server initialization and start; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "Network socket listening on server_host and server_port; serving policy files over network.",
  "flows": "Server setup flows from import to start, then runs serve_forever(), serving data to clients connecting to the socket.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward server startup script for serving cross-domain policies. It does not process external inputs, perform data exfiltration, or contain malicious code. The purpose is legitimate, and no security flaws or suspicious patterns are present. The server's network exposure is typical for such services but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a legitimate purpose in web socket environments. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low security risk 0.1–0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
