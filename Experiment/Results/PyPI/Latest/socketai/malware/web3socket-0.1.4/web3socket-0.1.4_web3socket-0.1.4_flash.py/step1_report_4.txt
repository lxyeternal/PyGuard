  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server for WebSocket connections, primarily to serve cross-domain policy files.",
  "sources": "import sys; usage of web3socket.policyserver.FlashPolicyServer; server.start()",
  "sinks": "server.serve_forever() runs an open network service; outputting server info to stderr",
  "flows": "Initialization of server object -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code simply initiates a policy server.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sys module and the FlashPolicyServer class. It initializes a server object with a 'noisy' parameter set to True, starts the server, and logs server details to stderr. It then runs the server indefinitely. No data leaks, no external data exfiltration, nor malicious code injection is evident. The server being started is a standard component for WebSocket cross-domain policy management, which is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup for a Flash policy server, commonly used in WebSocket or Flash applications to handle cross-origin requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious intent.",
