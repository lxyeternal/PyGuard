  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server for Web3Socket, likely to facilitate WebSocket connections in a secure manner.",
  "sources": "import sys; reading module attributes; server.start(); server.server_host; server.server_port",
  "sinks": "printing to stderr; server.serve_forever()",
  "flows": "Initialization of the server object, starting the server, outputting server details, then entering infinite serve loop",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious code structures, no obfuscated code. Usage of standard library and known module 'web3socket.policyserver'.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and a specific server class from web3socket.policyserver. It initializes a FlashPolicyServer instance with 'noisy=True', then starts it, logs server address info to stderr, and runs the server indefinitely. No untrusted data input, no dynamic code execution, no network connections initiated by this script other than server start, no embedded secrets or backdoors. The server is intended to serve Flash policy requests, a common feature for WebSocket setups that require policy files. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for running a Flash policy server with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It appears safe and purpose-driven for facilitating WebSocket connections, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
