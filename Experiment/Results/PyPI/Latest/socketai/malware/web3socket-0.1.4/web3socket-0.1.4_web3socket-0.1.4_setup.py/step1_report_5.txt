{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and install the 'web3socket' Python package by reading its version from the package's __init__.py file and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using a regex search on file read.",
  "sinks": "The script does not contain any typical security sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls; it primarily executes setup procedures.",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from the package file and used as the package version in the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'assert __version__' without a message is minimal but not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The regex assumes the version string is correctly formatted.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup routine: importing setup, reading version info, and invoking setup(). The regex used to extract version is straightforward and safe, with no malicious pattern. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code is simple, standard, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose in package configuration. No security concerns are identified.",
