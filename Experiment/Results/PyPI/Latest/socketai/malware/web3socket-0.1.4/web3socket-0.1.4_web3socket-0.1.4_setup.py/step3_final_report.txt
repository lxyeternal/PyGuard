  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'web3socket' Python module, extracting version info from __init__.py.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' via regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup() uses static package data and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads version from file -> regex extraction -> setup() call with metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex for version extraction is common; no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The regex pattern for version extraction is standard but could fail if the format changes, which is a minor concern. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Overall, the script performs package configuration without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or concern is necessary.",
