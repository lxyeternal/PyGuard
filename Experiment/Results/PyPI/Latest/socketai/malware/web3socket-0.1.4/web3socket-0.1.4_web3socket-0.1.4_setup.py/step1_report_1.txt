  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the web3socket Python package, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using a regex search.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data outputs or external data handling beyond standard setup process.",
  "flows": "Extracts version info from the package init file, then proceeds with package setup; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to read version; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the version string dynamically from the package source using regex, which is a common practice. The rest of the code is a standard Python package setup using setuptools or distutils, with dependencies and metadata specified. No suspicious or malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. There are no code injections, network calls, or data leaks. The approach appears safe and standard for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It correctly retrieves version info and defines package metadata without any suspicious behavior.",
