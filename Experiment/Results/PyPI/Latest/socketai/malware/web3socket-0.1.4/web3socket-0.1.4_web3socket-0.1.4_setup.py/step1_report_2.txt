  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'web3socket' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'web3socket/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no data leakage points or external data manipulations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file, uses static package data, and calls setup() for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version info directly from a file; no apparent malicious anomalies. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup: importing setup tools, extracting version info from the package's __init__.py via regex, and invoking setup() with package details. The version extraction relies on reading a file and parsing a line with a regex pattern; this is common and safe. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. The setup parameters are static and standard. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
