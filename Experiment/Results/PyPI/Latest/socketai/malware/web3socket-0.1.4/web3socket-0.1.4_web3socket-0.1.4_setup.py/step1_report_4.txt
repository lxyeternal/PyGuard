{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'web3socket' for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using a regex pattern.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; the script performs only package setup tasks.",
  "flows": "The version string from the file is extracted and used in the setup function; no other data flows or processing of untrusted input occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The method for extracting version relies on regex without validation, but this is a common practice and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup routine for a Python package, attempting to read the version from a source file. It uses a try-except block to import setup from setuptools or distutils. The version extraction uses regex to read the version string from a file, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears straightforward and legitimate for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely handles package metadata and dependencies without processing untrusted input or executing suspicious code.",
