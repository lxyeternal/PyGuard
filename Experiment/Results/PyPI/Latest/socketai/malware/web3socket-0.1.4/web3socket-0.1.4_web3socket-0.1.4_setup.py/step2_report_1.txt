  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script that reads the version string from `web3socket/__init__.py` using regex and proceeds with package configuration.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is identified in the code itself.\n- The regex used for version extraction is common practice, although it could potentially fail if the format changes, but this is not malicious.\n- No external data, network activity, or untrusted data processing occurs.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The version extraction method, while relying on regex, is a standard approach and not inherently risky.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only minor concern is that if the regex pattern does not match, `group(1)` will raise an exception. However, this is a common pattern and not malicious.\n- The reports do not mention this potential failure mode explicitly, but it does not impact security.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the benign nature of the script. Slightly higher scores might be due to the regex pattern, but overall, the risk remains minimal.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- The risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1), reflecting the benign nature.\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores unless malicious activity or vulnerabilities are identified, which is not the case here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The regex-based version extraction is common and safe, although slightly fragile.\n- No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just considering potential regex failure, not security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately. No further action or concern is necessary based on this review.",
