{
  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket server with associated handler, supporting policy server and serving static files for web3socket interactions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables ('PATH_INFO', 'HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH'), socket connections, and file system reads for static content.",
  "sinks": "Static file reading (open), setting HTTP response headers, logging output, and socket management.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and request path → static file serving or Web3Socket initialization → HTTP responses with file content or status codes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling without specific error management, potentially masking underlying issues. No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed. Use of 'assert' for version check is standard but could be exploited if Python version mismatch occurs, although unlikely malicious. No suspicious external domain connections or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages a WebSocket server and static file serving, with careful handling of policy server startup and socket lifecycle. Error handling is broad but standard for server code. No evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. The code does not appear to perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads. It functions as a typical server implementation with standard libraries and patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate WebSocket server implementation with static file serving capabilities. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The overall security risk is low.",
