  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a server handling WebSocket connections, static file serving, and optional Flash policy server support.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external connections are evident.\n- The code uses broad exception handling (`except:`), which can mask errors but is common in server code.\n- Static files are served from the filesystem with MD5-based ETag validation, which is standard.\n- Environment variables and user input influence server behavior, but no malicious data flow is apparent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious payloads are detected.\n- The overall security risk appears low.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard WebSocket + static file server.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low risk score is appropriate.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on WebSocket and static files.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with the code. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** WebSocket server with static files and policy server.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nMatches the code's behavior. No suspicious activity or obfuscation.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** WebSocket + static file server, with policy server.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No malicious or obfuscated code.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** WebSocket + static files + policy server.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, aligns with the code. No malicious indicators.  \n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Justification**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity, payload, or suspicious network behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across all reports seems reasonable given the broad exception handling and minimal validation, but no malicious intent. Slightly higher risk could be argued due to broad exception handling masking errors, but overall, 0.2 remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (standard server code with some broad exception handling, but no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** While the code could be improved with more specific exception handling and input validation, these are standard practices and do not indicate malicious intent. The supply chain security risk remains low.",
