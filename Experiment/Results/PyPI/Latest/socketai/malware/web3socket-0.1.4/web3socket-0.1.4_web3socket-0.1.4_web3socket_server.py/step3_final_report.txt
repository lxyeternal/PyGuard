{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket server with static file serving and optional Flash policy server support, primarily for handling WebSocket connections and serving static assets.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads for static files, environment variables for request context, socket data for WebSocket communication",
  "sinks": "HTTP response headers and body, socket closure, logging outputs",
  "flows": "Filesystem access to serve files, environment variables influencing request handling, socket data flow for WebSocket communication",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except:' clauses which can mask errors, minimal input validation, reliance on environment variables without sanitization",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard server implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It handles static files with MD5-based ETag validation, manages WebSocket connections, and optionally runs a Flash policy server. Broad exception handling is present but typical for server code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are detected. The code's structure and logic do not indicate malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard WebSocket server with static file support. No malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
