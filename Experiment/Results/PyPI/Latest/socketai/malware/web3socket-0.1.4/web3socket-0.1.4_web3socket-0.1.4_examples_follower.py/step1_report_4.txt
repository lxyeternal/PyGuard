{
  "purpose": "The code implements a web server application that manages websocket connections and serves static files, with periodic updates sent to connected clients.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, socket inputs via socket.receive(), and file content from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Sockets used for sending messages, file content read from disk, and printing/logging functions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or socket inputs as sources, data is sent over sockets or read from files, with control flow managing socket connections and file serving.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. Use of 'assert' on message being None could cause interruptions. No obfuscated code or suspicious file operations. The sleep calculation and threading appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical websocket-based server application utilizing gevent for concurrency. It reads files ('json.js' or 'follower.html') to serve content, spawns greenlets for receiving data from sockets, and periodically sends updates to all sockets. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or external connections are evident. The use of 'assert' on message may cause disruptions but not malicious harm. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard server patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign websocket server implementation with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not exhibit malware patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network activities. The overall security risk is low.",
