{
  "purpose": "A web server managing WebSocket-like connections, serving static files, and broadcasting messages periodically.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, socket data via socket.receive(), file contents via open().read(), and socket.getpeername().",
  "sinks": "Socket.send() for message transmission, file read operations, print statements for logging.",
  "flows": "Socket.receive() reads data; socket.send() transmits messages; server serves static files; periodic broadcast loops through sockets to send messages.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert message is None' in receive() is unconventional; broad exception handling in serve_file() suppresses errors; no validation of socket data or environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard WebSocket-like server with static file serving and periodic broadcasting. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The 'assert' statement in receive() is unusual but not malicious; it may cause connection drops if socket.receive() returns data, but this is not a security issue. Exception handling is broad but not malicious. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are detected. The overall security posture is low risk, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0. The risk score of 0.2 reflects minor concerns like the assertion and exception handling but does not indicate a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning as a typical WebSocket server component. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The low risk score is appropriate. The unconventional assertion should be reviewed for stability but does not constitute a security concern.",
