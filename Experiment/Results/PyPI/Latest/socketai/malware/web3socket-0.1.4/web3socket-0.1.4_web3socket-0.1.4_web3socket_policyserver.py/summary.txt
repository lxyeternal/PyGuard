  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the permissive policy XML, which could be a security risk if exposed publicly, but this does not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
