{
  "purpose": "The code covertly collects Telegram 'tdata' folder contents, compresses them into a zip file, and exfiltrates via a hardcoded Telegram bot API, while also spawning background processes to ensure persistence and self-deletion.",
  "sources": "Reads 'USERNAME' environment variable, accesses filesystem paths related to Telegram data, reads files for compression, and retrieves environment variables for tokens and chat IDs.",
  "sinks": "Uploads files via network POST requests to Telegram API, deletes local files, spawns background processes monitoring parent process, and performs self-deletion of temporary scripts.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem paths -> zip compression of Telegram data -> network upload via Telegram API -> file deletion -> background process for persistence and cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, use of obfuscated code, creation of background processes monitoring parent process, self-deletion tactics, and covert data exfiltration disguised as utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The script locates Telegram's 'tdata' folder based on the 'USERNAME' environment variable, compresses it while ignoring cache directories, and uploads it to a Telegram bot using a hardcoded token. It then deletes the local archive. Additionally, it spawns background processes that monitor the parent process to maintain persistence. The code is heavily obfuscated, with suspicious variable names and dynamic code execution. These behaviors are consistent with malicious exfiltration and persistence mechanisms, indicating clear malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to covertly exfiltrate Telegram user data by compressing and uploading the 'tdata' folder contents via a hardcoded Telegram bot, while establishing persistence through background process monitoring and self-deletion. The presence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, and process manipulation confirms high malicious intent.",
