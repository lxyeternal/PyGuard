  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the 'quickcolors' Python package.",
  "sources": "Setup parameters such as package name, version, author info, URL, and dependencies; no input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It contains no code that reads external input, executes untrusted code, or performs network or system modifications. The dependencies are straightforward and well-known ('requests'). There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be a typical, benign package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply specifies package information and dependencies for distribution.",
