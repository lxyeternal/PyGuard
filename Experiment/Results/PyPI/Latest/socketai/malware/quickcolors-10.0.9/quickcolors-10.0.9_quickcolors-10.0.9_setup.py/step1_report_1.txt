  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'quickcolors' Python utility library.",
  "sources": "Input is primarily from the setup() function parameters and the imported modules 'setuptools' and 'find_packages'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the script does not execute untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, then calls setup() with static parameters; no dynamic data flow or untrusted input handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and uses setup() to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It does not contain any code that reads external input or executes arbitrary code. All parameters are statically defined, and there are no suspicious behaviors or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no malicious behavior.",
