  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward, static setup.py script using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or network activity is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- All dependencies are well-known and benign ('requests').\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, malware, or obfuscation; standard setup.py.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The securityRisk is minimal; the code is benign.\n- **Assessment:** Scores are reasonable. The very low securityRisk score (0.1) is acceptable, considering the package metadata could potentially expose author info, but this is minimal.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup.py with no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0\n- **Assessment:** Correct and consistent. No risks identified.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup.py.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation in Report 1 (0.1) is reasonable given the minimal exposure of author info, but overall, all scores are low and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nGiven the consistent, straightforward nature of the code and the absence of any suspicious patterns, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.05 to 0.1** (very low, mainly due to metadata exposure, but not significant)\n\n**In summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is a standard, safe setup.py script.",
