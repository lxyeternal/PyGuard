  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a straightforward `setup.py` script using `setuptools` to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.\n   - No dynamic code execution, no reading external inputs, no network calls, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present.\n   - All parameters are static and standard for packaging a Python library.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as a typical, benign setup script.\n   - No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns, are detected.\n   - The reasoning that the code is safe and standard is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign `0` or `0.0`, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign `0` or `0.0`, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign very low or zero, which is justified.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code is static, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated content, the scores are reasonable.\n   - The only potential concern could be the `install_requires=[\"requests\"]`, but this is a common dependency and does not imply malicious intent.\n   - No claims or evidence suggest the package does anything malicious or harmful.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Recommendations**:\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n   - The scores reflect the benign nature of the script.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Score**: **0.1** — Very low, considering the package's purpose and static nature.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The overall security posture of this package appears safe.\n- The reports are accurate in their conclusions.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard, benign `setup.py` script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
