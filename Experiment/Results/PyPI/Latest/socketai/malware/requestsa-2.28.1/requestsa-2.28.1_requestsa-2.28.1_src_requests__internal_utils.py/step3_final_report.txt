  "purpose": "Utility functions for header validation and string handling within the Requests library, including regex-based validation, string conversion, and ASCII checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, imported modules 're' and 'compat'.",
  "sinks": "In-memory processing; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation and conversion functions without external or unsafe data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility functions performing regex validation, string encoding/decoding, and ASCII checks. Regex patterns are standard for HTTP header validation. Functions do not perform external actions, network communication, or code execution. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is simple, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for the Requests library, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The scores are appropriate, with malware, obfuscated, and risk scores set to 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
