  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use by the Requests library to validate headers and handle string conversions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as 'string' and 'u_string'. It also imports 're' and a local module '.compat'.",
  "sinks": "The functions process input data for validation and conversion; no sinks that send data externally or perform destructive actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'to_native_string' and 'unicode_is_ascii' functions, primarily for validation and encoding checks. No external data flows or unsafe data handling are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. The code performs straightforward validation and encoding operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string normalization and validation, with regex-based header validation. It imports 're' for pattern matching and a compatibility module. The 'to_native_string' function converts input to a native string type, decoding bytes if necessary. The 'unicode_is_ascii' function checks if a Unicode string contains only ASCII characters, asserting input type and attempting encoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All operations are standard string handling routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for string handling and header validation, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities identified.",
