{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use within the 'requests' library, mainly for header validation and string encoding conversions.",
  "sources": "import statements, usage of 're' module, 'builtin_str' from '.compat', string inputs to functions",
  "sinks": "None apparent; functions perform string validation and conversion without external output or data sinks",
  "flows": "Input data (strings) are processed through validation regexes and encoding/decoding functions, but no external or untrusted data flow to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs straightforward validation and conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string validation and conversion. Regular expressions validate header names and values, which is standard. 'to_native_string' converts various string types to the native string type, and 'unicode_is_ascii' checks for ASCII content. No external data or commands are invoked, no data exfiltration mechanisms, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not include any suspicious logic or side effects; it appears to be standard utility code. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard utility code for string validation and encoding. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present.",
