{
  "purpose": "Provide internal utility functions for the 'requests' library, specifically for string handling and header validation.",
  "sources": "Input is from function parameters: 'string', 'encoding', and 'u_string'. No external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands are present that could leak data or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs to internal processing and return values, with no external interactions or data propagation outside the functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The code uses regex patterns for validation and performs string encoding/decoding securely.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for converting strings to native format and checking ASCII compliance. It uses safe regex patterns and standard string operations. No external data sources, network operations, or potentially malicious behaviors are present. The functions serve legitimate purposes within the requests library and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward utility code with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no evident security vulnerabilities.",
