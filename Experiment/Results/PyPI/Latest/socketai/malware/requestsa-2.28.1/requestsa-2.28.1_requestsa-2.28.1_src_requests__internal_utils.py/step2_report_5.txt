  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Provides utility functions for string handling and header validation.\n- Uses regex for header name/value validation.\n- Converts input to native string, decoding bytes if necessary.\n- Checks if a Unicode string contains only ASCII characters.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or destructive operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code appears benign; no malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are evident. The functions are standard utility routines.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **None identified.**  \n  The regex patterns are standard for header validation, and string conversions are straightforward.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or 0.95. Given the code's benign purpose, a risk score of 0.5 or higher is unwarranted unless there are hidden issues.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The code performs safe string conversions and validation.\n- No external calls, no data exfiltration, no code execution.\n- Regex patterns are standard, not obfuscated.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- Some reports give a risk score of 0.95, which seems high for such utility functions. Unless there's an underlying concern about misuse, this should be lowered to 0.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign, utility nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\nBased on the review, I concur with the assessments that the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious intent. The scores should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**This aligns with the analysis that the code is routine utility functions with no security concerns.**",
