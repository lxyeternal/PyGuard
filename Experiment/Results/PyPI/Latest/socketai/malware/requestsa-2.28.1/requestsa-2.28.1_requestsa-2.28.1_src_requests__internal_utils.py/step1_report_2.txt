{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling HTTP headers validation and string conversions within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from function parameters 'string', 'encoding', and 'u_string'. No external data sources are used.",
  "targets": "Data is processed and returned; no external sinks such as network or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through functions with internal logic; no external or untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Regular expression patterns are standard for header validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation and includes utility functions for string handling and ASCII checks. No external data is read, nor is any data written or transmitted. The functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The regex patterns are standard for HTTP headers and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent. The functions operate purely in-memory and handle string conversions safely. Overall, the code appears to serve as internal utility functions without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for string handling and validation within the Requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
