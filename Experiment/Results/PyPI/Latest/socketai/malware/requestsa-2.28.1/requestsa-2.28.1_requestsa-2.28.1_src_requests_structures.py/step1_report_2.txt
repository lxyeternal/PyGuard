  "purpose": "Provide data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and a simple lookup dictionary used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The __init__ methods, property accessors (__getitem__, get), and update methods in the classes.",
  "sinks": "The __getitem__, __setitem__, and __delitem__ methods that access or modify internal storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (data, key) through internal storage and retrieval methods, mainly via dictionary operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious constructs. The classes implement standard dictionary-like behaviors without dynamic code execution or external data fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which provides a case-insensitive dictionary interface using an internal OrderedDict, and LookupDict, a simple dict subclass with an optional name attribute. The classes implement standard methods for dictionary behavior, including case-insensitive key handling and value retrieval. No external data sources, network calls, or code injection points are present. The implementation appears to be straightforward and aligned with typical data structure usage, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains standard data structure implementations with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is consistent with expected functionality within a request processing library. The overall security risk is very low.",
