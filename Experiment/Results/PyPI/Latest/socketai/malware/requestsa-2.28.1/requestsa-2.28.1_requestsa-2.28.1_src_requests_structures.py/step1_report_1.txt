  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling HTTP headers and key-value mappings in a case-insensitive manner.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data structures, data passed into constructors, item access methods (__getitem__, get).",
  "sinks": "Potential access points via __getitem__, get methods, and iteration over the data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal storage, then through accessor methods (__getitem__, get) to external use.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. CaseInsensitiveDict provides a case-insensitive dictionary interface, storing keys in lowercase but preserving original case for iteration and representation. It uses an OrderedDict internally, with standard methods like __setitem__, __getitem__, __delitem__, __iter__, and comparison methods. LookupDict extends dict with a 'name' attribute and custom __repr__, and __getitem__, get methods that access internal __dict__ without suspicious behavior. There are no code injection points, no external data leaks, nor any network or file operations. The data structures serve as utility classes without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of utility data structures for managing case-insensitive headers and lookup mappings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation appears standard and safe.",
