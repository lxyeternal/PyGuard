  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and decorative emojis.",
  "sources": "Metadata assignments, including string literals and Unicode emojis.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data input or output points.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static metadata to module-level variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode emojis in metadata (__cake__) is unusual but harmless; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of metadata definitions for a Python package, including version info, author details, and a decorative emoji. There are no input sources, no data processing, or external communications. The Unicode emojis are decorative and do not indicate malicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for package metadata, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign package metadata with no malicious intent. It merely provides descriptive information about the 'requests' library. No security risks or malicious behaviors are present.",
