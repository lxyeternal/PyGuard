  "purpose": "Static package metadata defining the 'requests' library information.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic input, output, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode emojis (__cake__) and ASCII art comment, both purely decorative; no suspicious or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no functions, dynamic code, network calls, or obfuscation. The Unicode emoji and ASCII art are benign decorative elements. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and static nature imply no security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package metadata with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, well-formed structure. No adjustments are necessary.",
