  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe static variable assignments for package metadata.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or data processing is present.\n- ASCII art and Unicode emojis are decorative, not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The code is purely static metadata for the 'requests' package.\n- No issues are present in the code itself.\n- The scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only unusual element is the use of Unicode emojis in the `__cake__` variable, but this is purely decorative and harmless.\n- ASCII art comments are also harmless.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores as 0.\n- Confidence is 1, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- The code is standard package metadata with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, straightforward metadata with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
