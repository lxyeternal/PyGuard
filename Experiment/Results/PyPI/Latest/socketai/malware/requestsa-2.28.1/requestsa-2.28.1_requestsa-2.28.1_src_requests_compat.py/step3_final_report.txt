  "purpose": "Compatibility utility module for handling import issues and environment detection between Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version detection, optional dependency imports (chardet, simplejson).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs environment setup.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward compatibility handling with safe import attempts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility layer that manages imports, version detection, and optional dependencies. It performs safe import attempts with exception handling, sets version flags, and defines type aliases. There are no network operations, data leaks, or execution of untrusted code. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a typical compatibility utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
