{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling character detection libraries, Python version differences, and importing modules in a way that supports both Python 2 and 3 for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard Python libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib), dynamic import attempts for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', conditional import for 'simplejson', and assignment of type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data flows that could lead to data leakage or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The dynamic import and conditional logic are confined to module setup and compatibility handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code strictly adheres to compatibility and utility functions, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for backward compatibility and library support, using safe import practices and standard library functions. The dynamic import for 'chardet' and conditional JSON import are standard practices. No execution of untrusted data, no network communication, no code injection, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward, structured, and maintains clear separation of concerns. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard compatibility module for the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It safely manages imports and compatibility issues without any suspicious or malicious code.",
