  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility utility module, handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- All reports agree that the code performs safe, well-understood operations with no malicious intent.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, execute network commands, or contain obfuscated/malicious patterns.\n- The assigned malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n- The code is straightforward, performing compatibility imports and optional dependency handling.\n\n**2. Logical flaws, mistakes, or reasoning errors:**\n\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n- The reasoning in the reports aligns with the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**3. Scores assigned:**\n\n- Malware: all 0, justified given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated: all 0, justified.\n- Security risk: all 0, justified.\n- Confidence: 1, appropriate given the clarity and safety of the code.\n\n**4. Any anomalies or suspicious claims:**\n\n- No anomalies or suspicious claims are identified.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a benign, standard compatibility utility module with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' evaluations are accurate and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe and non-malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
