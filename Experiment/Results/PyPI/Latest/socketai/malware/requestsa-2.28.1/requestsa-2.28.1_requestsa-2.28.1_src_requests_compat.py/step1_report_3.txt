{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities and import handling for Python 2 and 3 in the requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dynamic import of character detection libraries, sys.version_info for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is being processed or written.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static import resolution and compatibility setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code. The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is standard practice for optional dependencies. No hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, and no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs import resolution, Python version detection, and compatibility setup. It imports optional dependencies, handles version-specific imports, and defines some type aliases. All actions are standard for ensuring backward compatibility. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are present. No network or system manipulation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves only compatibility purposes without any malicious intent. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
