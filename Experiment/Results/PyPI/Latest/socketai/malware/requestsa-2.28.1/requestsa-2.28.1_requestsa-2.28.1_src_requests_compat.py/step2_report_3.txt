  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims against the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily about compatibility handling between Python 2 and 3, optional dependency imports (chardet, simplejson), and setting up standard library imports.\n- No data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The code uses standard, well-understood practices for compatibility and optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. It performs standard compatibility tasks and safe import handling.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n  No logical errors or security flaws are apparent. The import attempts are safe, and version detection is straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:**\n\n  - **Malware score:**  \n    All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n  - **Obfuscated score:**  \n    All reports assign 0, which is accurate; there's no obfuscation.\n\n  - **Risk score:**  \n    All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign, compatibility-focused code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The code does **not** process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code based on untrusted inputs.\n- The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is a common pattern for optional dependencies.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, and no obfuscation are present.\n- The code is a typical compatibility layer, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior or code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the code and reports, **the scores assigned are appropriate and consistent**. The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility module.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the actual code content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is safe, non-malicious, and purely for compatibility purposes. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
