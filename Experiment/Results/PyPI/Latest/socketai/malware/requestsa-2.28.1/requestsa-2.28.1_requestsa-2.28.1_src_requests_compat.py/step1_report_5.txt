{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility handling for different Python versions and imports necessary dependencies for HTTP requests, character detection, and JSON parsing.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for character detection libraries, sys.version_info for Python version, import statements for json/simplejson, collection modules, http cookies, and urllib modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly uses untrusted data; import statements and variable assignments are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "N/A - No dynamic data flow is established in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard compatibility techniques without any suspicious or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles compatibility for Python 2 and 3, imports standard libraries, and sets up environment variables. It uses safe, standard Python practices for importing modules, handling import errors, and version detection. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious actions are present. The use of try-except for optional modules is common and safe. No anomalies or malicious indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import setup module with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger package, focusing on environment setup.",
