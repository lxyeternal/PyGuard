{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion between different formats.",
  "sources": "Reads data from request objects (e.g., request.url, request.headers), cookie objects (name, value, domain, path), and response headers via response._original_response.msg.",
  "sinks": "Generates 'Cookie' header strings, modifies cookie jars, clears cookies, and updates cookie jars, which could affect cookie state and privacy if misused.",
  "flows": "Extracts cookies from HTTP responses into cookie jars; generates cookie headers for requests; adds or removes cookies from jars based on cookie attributes and input data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a custom MockRequest class to mimic urllib2.Request interface; converts Morsel objects into cookies; supports pickleability of cookie jar; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling routines, including converting cookies, extracting from responses, and managing cookie jars. It uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. There are no indications of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of MockRequest and MockResponse is consistent with compatibility and testing purposes, not malicious intent. The functions operate within the scope of cookie management without external network activity or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of cookie management functions for the requests library. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activity is evident. The code appears safe and intended solely for cookie handling.",
