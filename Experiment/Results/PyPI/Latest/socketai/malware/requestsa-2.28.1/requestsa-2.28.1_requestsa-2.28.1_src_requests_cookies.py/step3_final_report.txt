{
  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for cookie management within the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, and storage, with wrappers to mimic urllib interfaces.",
  "sources": "Request headers, request URL, response headers (msg), environment variables (indirectly via headers), input parameters for cookie functions.",
  "sinks": "CookieJar storage, request headers ('Cookie'), response headers, internal cookie data structures.",
  "flows": "Request headers and URL → Cookie extraction and cookie jar updates; response headers → cookie extraction; cookie jar → request headers ('Cookie').",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Use of threading fallback is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling utilities, including wrappers for request and response objects, cookie extraction, creation, and management. No network activity or malicious behavior is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with typical patterns for cookie management. No obfuscation or malicious logic is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, utility-focused, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. It handles cookies securely within expected parameters, with a low inherent security risk. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
