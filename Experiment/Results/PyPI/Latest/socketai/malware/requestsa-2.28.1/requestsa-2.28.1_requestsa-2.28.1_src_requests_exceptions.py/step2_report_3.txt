  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- It imports from standard libraries (`urllib3.exceptions`, a compat module) and defines custom exceptions.\n- There are no input/output operations, network activity, or data manipulation.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.\n- The structure follows standard Python practices for exception hierarchies.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n\n**Risk Score Justification:**\n- The code's purpose is purely for error handling within a well-known, widely used library.\n- No security risks, data leaks, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or external data processing.\n\n**Scores Consistency:**\n- The reports' scores are consistent with the code content.\n- All indicate a risk and malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential for higher risk scores?**\n- Given the content, assigning a higher risk or malware score would be unjustified.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or contain any suspicious patterns.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard exception hierarchy for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The assigned scores are accurate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
