{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; it defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or sends data; it defines error types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is purely exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures detected. The code follows standard Python exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from standard libraries and defines various custom exception classes related to HTTP requests. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The inheritance from standard exceptions and proper documentation comments indicate a typical exception hierarchy. No suspicious data handling or network activity is present. The presence of a compatibility import suggests cross-version support, which is standard practice. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for error handling within the Requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of exception classes for the Requests library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The code's purpose is purely for error categorization and handling.",
