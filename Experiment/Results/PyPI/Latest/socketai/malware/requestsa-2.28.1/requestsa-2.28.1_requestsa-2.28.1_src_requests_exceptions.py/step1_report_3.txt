{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions, imports from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; exception classes are used for error handling and logging.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised during error conditions; no untrusted data flows into sinks from the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various exceptions used by the Requests library, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and other imported exceptions. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no data leaks are present. All code is static class definitions. The imports are from well-known libraries, and the code structure is straightforward. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are evident. The code primarily establishes a hierarchy for exception handling, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class hierarchy for a widely used HTTP library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and does not perform any dangerous operations. It appears to be safe and serves purely for error handling within the Requests package.",
