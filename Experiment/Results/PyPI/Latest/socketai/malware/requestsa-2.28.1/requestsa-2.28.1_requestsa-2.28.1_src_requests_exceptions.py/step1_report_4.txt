{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes used within the Requests library for handling HTTP and network-related errors.",
  "sources": "Class initializers, attribute checks (e.g., hasattr), and inheritance structures",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; exceptions are for control flow and error reporting",
  "flows": "N/A - primarily class definitions with inheritance and attribute handling, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes related to HTTP request handling, with appropriate inheritance. It uses standard Python features such as inheritance, attribute checking, and method overriding. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception definitions with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It contains no suspicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks. Overall, it appears safe and purposeful for error handling within the library.",
