  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes for the Requests library to handle HTTP errors and related issues.",
  "sources": "None; primarily class definitions and imports with no input handling or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs, network connections, or untrusted data handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscated code are present. The code consists solely of class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard exception module for the Requests library, including class hierarchies for HTTP errors, connection issues, timeouts, and warnings. It imports exceptions from urllib3 and compatibility modules, and defines custom exceptions with clear inheritance structures. There are no input/output operations, network interactions, or suspicious logic. The code structure is straightforward and typical for such a module, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class definitions module for handling errors in the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks within this code fragment.",
