  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a set of exception classes for the Requests library, importing from standard libraries (`urllib3.exceptions`) and a compatibility module.\n- The classes are standard, inheriting from built-in exceptions or other exceptions, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The purpose is error categorization and handling within the library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code only defines exception classes; no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code follows standard Python practices for exception class definitions.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 in all reports.\n  - Risk: 0 in all reports.\n  \n  These seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code only defines exception classes with no network activity, data handling, or obfuscation, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the absence of vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is static class definitions, with no dynamic or external data handling, so no vulnerabilities are implied.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code’s nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is purely for exception handling, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statements, class hierarchies, and documentation are all standard. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
