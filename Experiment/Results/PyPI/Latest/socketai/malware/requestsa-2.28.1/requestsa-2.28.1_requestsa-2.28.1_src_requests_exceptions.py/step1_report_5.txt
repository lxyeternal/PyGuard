  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various request-related errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module; class initializations and attribute accesses; potential exception raising during request handling.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations and attribute accesses that could influence control flow or error handling.",
  "flows": "Exceptions may be raised during HTTP operations, propagated through class inheritance and __init__ methods, with potential data associated with request and response objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data manipulations. Exception classes follow standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for the Requests library, with careful handling of initialization and pickling behavior, especially for JSON decoding errors. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The exception flow is standard, and there are no signs of malicious payloads or security risks. The class methods and attributes are typical for error handling and do not involve external data or untrusted inputs beyond standard exception raising.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes for a request-handling library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, conventional, and free from harmful behavior.",
