{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of exception classes for handling various HTTP and request-related errors within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and a local compat module; class definitions that inherit from standard exceptions and each other.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or external data handling; no untrusted data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance and exception raising are confined within the module; no external data flows or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for the Requests library, importing from standard and compat modules. It contains no input/output operations, network activity, or data processing. The structure is standard, with inheritance from built-in exceptions, and no obfuscation or secrets. The purpose is error categorization, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks. The code is static and well-structured, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for request error handling, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero.",
