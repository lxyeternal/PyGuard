  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a set of exception classes for the Requests library.\n- It imports exceptions from standard libraries (`urllib3.exceptions` and a local compat module).\n- The classes are standard, inheriting from built-in exceptions or other request-specific exceptions.\n- No data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code is static, with clear purpose: error categorization and handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code contains only class definitions and imports; no input/output, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about untrusted data or external inputs beyond standard exception handling.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code adheres to standard Python practices for defining exception classes.\n- The handling of `JSONDecodeError` with custom `__reduce__` method is correct for pickling support.\n- No suspicious or malformed code structures.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0. The code is purely class definitions for error handling.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 is a conservative threshold; since the code is benign, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- All reports consistently conclude the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious patterns.\n- No report suggests any hidden payload, backdoor, or suspicious logic.\n- The exception hierarchy is typical for an HTTP request library.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception class definitions. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The consistent findings across all reports support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no security concerns. It serves a clear purpose within the Requests library, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores should reflect this, with zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
