  "purpose": "This script outputs the file path to the default CA certificate bundle used for SSL/TLS verification, leveraging the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The script prints the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' from certifi -> call 'where()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign utility that reports the location of a trusted CA bundle. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The only potential concern is environmental info disclosure via printing the path, which is common in diagnostic scripts and poses negligible security risk. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with scores reflecting no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The slight variation in security risk score (0.1) in one report is justified but could be lowered to 0 for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate; the minor environmental info disclosure does not constitute a significant security concern. Therefore, no modifications to the reports are necessary.",
