{
  "purpose": "To return the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The output of the 'where()' function printed to stdout.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> call 'where()' -> print result.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and only interacts with a trusted third-party library.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and prints its output when executed directly. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code's purpose appears to be to output the location of the CA bundle. The use of a well-known, trusted library ('certifi') minimizes risk. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior. The code is simple and safe, intended for a utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and uses a trusted library to output the CA bundle location. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
