{
  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The import of 'where' from the 'certifi' package; the call to 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path; this could potentially be misused if the path is manipulated, but as-is, it merely outputs a trusted location.",
  "flows": "The code imports a function from a trusted library and outputs its result; no untrusted data or external input flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, simple, and relies solely on a trusted library to output a fixed value.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi', which is a standard trusted package. It then outputs the path to the CA bundle when executed directly. There are no hardcoded secrets, no data leaks, no external inputs, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs a simple, benign operation of printing a certificate bundle path. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that reports the default CA bundle location from certifi. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security risks.",
