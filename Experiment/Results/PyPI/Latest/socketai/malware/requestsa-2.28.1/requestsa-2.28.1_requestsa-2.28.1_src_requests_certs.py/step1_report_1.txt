  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location using 'where' from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the CA bundle path, which is not a sink for untrusted data but an informational output.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'where' to printing its output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and uses a standard library function for a benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package to retrieve the default CA bundle path and prints it. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data flows into sensitive sinks, and no suspicious code patterns. It is a simple utility script with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a legitimate purpose of exposing the default CA bundle path. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are present.",
