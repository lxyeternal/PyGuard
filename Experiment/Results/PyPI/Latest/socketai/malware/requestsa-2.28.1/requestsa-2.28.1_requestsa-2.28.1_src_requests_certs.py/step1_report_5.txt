{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle provided by the certifi package, mainly for use in configuring SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function, which provides the location of the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The script prints the CA bundle path to standard output; this is generally safe and not a security sink, but it reveals information about the environment setup.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function's output flows directly to the print statement, revealing the path of the CA bundle.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and primarily informational.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package, then, when executed directly, it prints the path to the CA bundle. This is a benign operation used in SSL/TLS contexts. No data processing, user input, or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal and aligns with common practices for handling SSL certificate bundles.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to output the location of the certifi CA bundle. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior. It simply provides environmental information for SSL configuration purposes.",
