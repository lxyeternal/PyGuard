{
  "purpose": "The code returns the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, primarily for use in SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package, and the print statement that outputs its value.",
  "sinks": "The printed output could be used by external processes or scripts that invoke this script to obtain the CA bundle path; however, this is benign.",
  "flows": "Input is indirectly obtained via the 'where' function from 'certifi'; the output is the printed CA bundle path, with no further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, importing a well-known library and printing a value. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi', which provides the path to the trusted CA bundle. When executed, it prints this path. There are no user inputs, no network activity, and no manipulation of data. The code functions solely to reveal a trusted certificate bundle location. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is simple and intended for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and does not contain malware or security risks. It simply outputs the location of the certifi CA bundle. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are present.",
