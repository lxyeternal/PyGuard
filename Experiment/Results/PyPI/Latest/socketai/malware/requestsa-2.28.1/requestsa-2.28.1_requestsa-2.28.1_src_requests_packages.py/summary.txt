  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility hack. It does not contain malicious activity, but its technique can be exploited if the environment is compromised. The current scores (malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent and appropriate. Vigilance is advised in environments where module injection is possible, but the code itself is not malicious."
