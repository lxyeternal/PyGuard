  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') into 'requests.packages.*' via sys.modules manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet'; access to sys.modules for aliasing.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules modifications that could affect module resolution and potentially hide or hijack modules if environment is compromised.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to local variables and then aliased in sys.modules under 'requests.packages.*', affecting module lookup paths.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic sys.modules manipulation for compatibility; no malicious code, network activity, or data leaks present; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs namespace aliasing for legacy support, which involves manipulating sys.modules to redirect module references. This pattern is known and used for backward compatibility but can be exploited if malicious modules are introduced or environment is compromised. No active malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the context. The technique's risk is environmental, not inherent to the code itself. The code is not obfuscated and is straightforward, with high confidence in the benign intent. The main concern is potential misuse in compromised environments, but as written, it is a standard pattern for legacy support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility hack. It does not contain malicious activity, but its technique can be exploited if the environment is compromised. The current scores (malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent and appropriate. Vigilance is advised in environments where module injection is possible, but the code itself is not malicious.",
