  "purpose": "Maintain backwards compatibility by aliasing certain third-party modules and preserving module identity within sys.modules.",
  "sources": "Modules imported via __import__(package) and sys.modules during iteration over sys.modules",
  "sinks": "sys.modules modifications, which could influence module import behaviors or cause confusion",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules under new keys, potentially affecting module resolution at runtime",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic re-mapping of sys.modules entries, especially aliasing modules under 'requests.packages.*' and replacing module names in sys.modules; the code comments indicate an intentional workaround rather than malicious intent, but such dynamic manipulation can be misused if exploited",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages ('urllib3' and 'idna') and assigns them to local variables. It then modifies sys.modules entries to alias these packages under 'requests.packages.*', ensuring module identity preservation for compatibility. Additionally, if the 'chardet' module is available, it similarly aliases its modules under 'requests.packages.chardet'. These actions are typical for compatibility layers. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is present. The dynamic sys.modules modifications could be exploited if malicious modules are present or if the module names are manipulated, but in this context, the purpose is to maintain compatibility, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intended solely for compatibility, dynamically aliasing modules within sys.modules to preserve identities. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. While the dynamic sys.modules manipulation is unusual, it is not inherently malicious or risky in this context.",
