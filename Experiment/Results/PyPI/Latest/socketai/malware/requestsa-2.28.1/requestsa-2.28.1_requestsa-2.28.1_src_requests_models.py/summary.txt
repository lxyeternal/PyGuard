  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an HTTP request/response module with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the minimal security concern inherent in request handling code, which is well-understood and widely used."
