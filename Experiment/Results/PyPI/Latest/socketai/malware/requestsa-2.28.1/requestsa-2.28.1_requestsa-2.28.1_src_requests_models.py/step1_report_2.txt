{
  "purpose": "This module contains classes and functions to build, prepare, and handle HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, facilitating request creation, response parsing, and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from URL strings, input parameters such as headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, and hooks, as well as from raw request and response objects (e.g., raw stream, raw content).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data can be sent via request bodies (data, files, json), headers, cookies, or URL parameters. Response data can be accessed via content, text, or JSON parsing. These can lead to data leaks if malicious data is mishandled or exposed.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URL, headers, body, cookies) flows into preparation methods which encode, encode, and set headers, cookies, and body. Prepared requests then send data over network. Response objects receive raw data, which are decoded, parsed, and potentially exposed via properties. The flow can include malicious input leading to injection or leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to use standard libraries and patterns typical for HTTP request handling. There are no signs of malicious privacy violations, credential theft, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements request and response handling with encoding, header validation, URL parsing, and cookie management. It handles JSON encoding/decoding, multipart form data, and streaming content. The only points that could be misused are the encoding and handling of untrusted input data, which are standard and do not introduce malicious behavior. The response content is processed carefully with decoding and error handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The module appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of HTTP request/response processing within the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malware. It handles data securely within the expected scope of HTTP operations. Overall security risk is low.",
