{
  "purpose": "The code implements core classes and functions for handling HTTP requests and responses, including URL parsing, header validation, encoding, multipart form data, JSON serialization/deserialization, streaming response content, and error handling, forming the backbone of an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL strings, headers, data payloads, files, JSON objects, cookies, hooks, and authentication info provided during request preparation.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could flow into headers, URL parameters, request body, or cookies, and response data is processed and exposed via properties; potential vulnerabilities could arise if inputs are maliciously crafted, but no such malicious patterns are detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (URL, headers, data, files, JSON, cookies) into preparation methods (e.g., prepare_url, prepare_headers, prepare_body), and response data flows from raw network responses into parsing, decoding, and property access (e.g., content, text, json).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of an HTTP client component, handling URL encoding, header validation, JSON processing, multipart data, streaming responses, and error handling. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The data flow is typical for request/response handling, with input validation and safe processing. No hardcoded secrets or network anomalies are present. The functions and classes follow established patterns, and the overall design is transparent and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an HTTP request/response module with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the minimal security concern inherent in request handling code, which is well-understood and widely used.",
