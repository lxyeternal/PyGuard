  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard request/response handling, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; the code is well-known, standard, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The malware score is justified as zero, given no malicious activity. The low risk score aligns with the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard handling, no secrets, no backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings. No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on request/response handling, encoding, headers, cookies, no malicious payloads.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's functionality. No suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard request/response classes, no signs of malicious code, handles data securely.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard implementation, no backdoors, no malicious logic, legitimate web communication.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The most confident and positive assessment, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is a typical implementation of an HTTP client, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Not explicitly mentioned, but all reports indicate no obfuscation (score 0), which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns. Given the code is standard and no malicious activity is detected, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs standard request and response handling, including URL parsing, header validation, JSON encoding/decoding, multipart form data, and streaming responses.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The functions used are well-established, and the logic aligns with typical HTTP client behavior.\n- No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the general complexity of request handling but no actual vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The supply chain security risk for this code is negligible. It is a legitimate, standard implementation of an HTTP request/response module, with no malicious or obfuscated components.",
