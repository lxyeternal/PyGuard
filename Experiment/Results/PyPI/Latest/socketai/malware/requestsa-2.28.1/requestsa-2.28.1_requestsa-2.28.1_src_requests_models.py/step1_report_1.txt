{
  "purpose": "This module contains classes and functions related to constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL strings, headers, data payloads, files, JSON objects, cookies, and hooks provided by the user. Data is read from these parameters during request preparation and response processing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the final request body (body, files, json), headers, and cookies. Response content, headers, and status are sinks where data could be leaked or manipulated.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-provided inputs (URL, headers, data, files, json, cookies, hooks) through preparation methods (e.g., prepare_url, prepare_headers, prepare_body, prepare_cookies). These methods transform inputs into the final request components. The response class consumes response raw data, headers, and status, and provides methods to access content and parse JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. The code contains standard request/response handling routines. No unusual or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation mechanisms are present. All data handling and processing appear standard and consistent with typical HTTP client behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard request and response handling with methods for preparing URLs, headers, cookies, and request bodies. It encodes parameters, manages multipart form data, and processes response content with streaming, decoding, and JSON parsing capabilities. Error handling is aligned with common HTTP errors, and hooks allow callback registration. No suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or hidden backdoors are present. The logic appears to be legitimate request handling, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of HTTP request and response management in the Requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. All functionality aligns with typical usage for a well-established HTTP client library. The overall security risk is minimal.",
