{
  "purpose": "The code performs dependency management, version checks, environment setup, and SSL fallback configuration for the 'requests' library, ensuring compatibility and stability.",
  "sources": "Imports of external libraries (urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, ssl, cryptography), version variables, and environment-related checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no network calls, no data leaks, and no sensitive information handling.",
  "flows": "Version and environment checks are performed without data flow from untrusted sources; no network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, and no unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup routine for dependency validation, environment configuration, and compatibility assurance. It includes version assertions, warnings, and fallback mechanisms for SSL support. All operations are routine and do not involve untrusted data or malicious intent. The dependency checks and warnings are typical for ensuring library compatibility and stability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured environment and dependency setup routine for the 'requests' library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
