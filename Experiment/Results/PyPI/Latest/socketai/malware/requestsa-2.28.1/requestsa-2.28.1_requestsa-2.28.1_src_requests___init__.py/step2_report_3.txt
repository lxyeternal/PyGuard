  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and assessing the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes dependency management, version checks, and environment setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or network calls; primarily environment validation.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis:** Standard dependency checks, warnings, and environment configuration.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, routine setup code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, given the nature of dependency checks)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar dependency verification and environment setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Routine version validation, warnings, and environment configuration.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct, as it's just dependency validation)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Dependency version checks, environment setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or untrusted input handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Compatibility validation, environment configuration, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0 (standard dependency management)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Dependency imports, version checks, SSL fallback setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Typical environment and dependency validation routines.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0 (standard dependency validation)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Dependency checks, environment setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard dependency validation and environment configuration.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher but still low, given routine dependency checks and warning suppression)\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score might be marginally high but still acceptable, as it reflects routine setup.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of dependency validation and environment setup routines.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code snippets are standard, well-structured dependency and environment setup routines for the 'requests' library. No suspicious or malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration is present. The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for dependency management complexity, but still very low)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, with no signs of supply chain security issues or malicious intent.",
