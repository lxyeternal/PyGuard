  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard dependency and environment setup for 'requests'. No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, no malware detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — low, given it's a dependency setup script.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence in the assessment.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code performs dependency checks, warnings, and environment setup without any malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard dependency validation and environment configuration.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — consistent with a benign setup script.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No suspicious activity or obfuscation. All actions are typical for a library initialization.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, dependency verification, environment setup, and SSL fallback configuration.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency and environment management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also, dependency checks, compatibility assertions, and environment setup.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still low, considering it's a dependency management script.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The slightly elevated security risk score reflects caution but remains consistent with routine dependency checks. No malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Scores:** Generally low, reflecting the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with dependency management scripts.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured dependency and environment setup routine for the 'requests' library. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present. The scores across reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and performs routine dependency management.  \n- No changes needed in the scores.  \n- The overall security posture is very high, with no evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
