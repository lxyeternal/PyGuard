  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as dependency and environment setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or network calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; standard dependency checks and warnings.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (reasonable, given dependency management, but very low)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes dependency verification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just environment setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing dependency checks and environment setup.\n- No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- No network or data leakage concerns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern: dependency management, version checks, SSL fallback.\n- No malicious activity, no suspicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.9) but still no suspicious activity.\n- Emphasizes dependency checks, warnings, and environment configuration.\n- No network activity, data handling, or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (still very low, given the nature of the code)\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly higher risk score may reflect cautiousness, but still aligns with the code's intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with 0 for malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** The highest risk score is 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's purpose as dependency management. No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured dependency and environment setup script for the 'requests' library, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
