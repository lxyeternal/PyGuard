  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing the 'init' function from the main module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'init' from '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; code only performs a simple import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports a function called 'init' from a sibling module named 'main'. It contains only a single import statement with no data processing, input handling, or output generation. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious patterns. The simplicity suggests standard package initialization without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard package initialization pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
