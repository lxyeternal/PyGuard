  "purpose": "Minimal package initializer importing 'init' from a local module",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network activity, or external interactions",
  "flows": "Import from .main to local namespace; no data flow beyond module import",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement used in Python package initialization. It contains no data flows, network activity, or complex logic. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization import statement. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring is appropriate. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
