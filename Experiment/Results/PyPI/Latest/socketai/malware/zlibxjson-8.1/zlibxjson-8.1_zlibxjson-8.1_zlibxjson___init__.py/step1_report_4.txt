  "purpose": "Re-exporting the 'init' function from the main module, likely for initialization purposes of the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'init' from the '.main' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import allows other parts of the package or external code to access 'init', but no data flows or untrusted input handling are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement re-exporting 'init'. There are no data processing, input/output operations, or complex logic. The simplicity reduces risk of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It serves as an initializer or facade for the package.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a simple re-export of an initialization function. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
