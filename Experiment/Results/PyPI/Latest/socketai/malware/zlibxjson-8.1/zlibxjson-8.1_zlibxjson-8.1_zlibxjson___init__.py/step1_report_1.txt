  "purpose": "This module imports an initialization function from another module, likely to set up or configure the package.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only an import statement present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are evident",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'init' from the '.main' module. There are no data inputs, network connections, or execution of untrusted code. The minimalistic structure indicates typical package initialization behavior without any suspicious activity or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement used to initialize or set up a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and straightforward.",
