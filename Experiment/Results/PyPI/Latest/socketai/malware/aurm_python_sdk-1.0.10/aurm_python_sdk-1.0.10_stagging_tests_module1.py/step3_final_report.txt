{
  "purpose": "A simple test function returning a static string, likely used for demonstration or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communications, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function with no inputs, outputs, dependencies, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the harmless nature of the code. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
