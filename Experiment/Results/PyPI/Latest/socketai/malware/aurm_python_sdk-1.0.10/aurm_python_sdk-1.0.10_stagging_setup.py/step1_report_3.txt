{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the installation of a Python package, including downloading external data and modifying user shell configuration files.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a URL ('https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb') and reads/writes to user's home directory files (~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile).",
  "sinks": "Writing to ~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, and ~/.bash_profile; potentially executing or sourcing content that could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Data fetched from the URL is written into ~/.fleetwood.py; subsequent shell configuration files may source or execute this script if added, creating a potential source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The script downloads code from an external URL and appends a command to user shell configuration files to execute that code. No validation or verification of downloaded content is performed, which is suspicious. The code suppresses exceptions silently, masking potential errors or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during installation, fetches a script from a remote URL and writes it into a hidden file in the user's home directory. It then appends a command to source or run this script in shell config files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This behavior introduces the risk of executing remote code on the user's system, which can be malicious if the remote content is compromised or malicious. The download occurs over HTTPS, but there is no verification of the content's integrity or authenticity. The code suppresses exceptions silently, preventing detection of failures or malicious alterations. All other parts of the setup, such as package dependencies and metadata, appear standard.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious potential by downloading external code and configuring the user's environment to execute it without verification. This behavior indicates a high security risk. It could be used to execute malicious code at install time, potentially leading to system compromise. The overall security risk score is high, and the malware likelihood is significant.",
