  "purpose": "A standard Python package initializer (__init__.py) that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1, reading the test_function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication points",
  "flows": "Import of test_function from module1, exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py file that imports test_function from module1 and exposes it. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code structure is standard, and the import does not involve untrusted data or dynamic execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, with high confidence, no obfuscation, malware, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are consistent with this conclusion.",
