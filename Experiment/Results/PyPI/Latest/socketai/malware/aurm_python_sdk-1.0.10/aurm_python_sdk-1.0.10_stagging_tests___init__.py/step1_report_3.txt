  "purpose": "Initialization of the test module by importing test_function from module1 for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function 'test_function' from a sibling module within the tests package and exposes it via __all__. It functions solely as a module initializer for testing purposes without any data processing, user input, or external communication. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python test package setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test module initialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
