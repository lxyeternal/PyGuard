  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a sibling module and defines an export list. There are no dynamic code executions, no data manipulation, or external communication. It serves as a standard package initializer. No malicious behavior or anomalies are present.",
