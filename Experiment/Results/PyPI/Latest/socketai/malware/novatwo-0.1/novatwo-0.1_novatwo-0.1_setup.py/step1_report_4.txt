{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'novatwo' with metadata and package information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandraajvab/a/refs/heads/main/x.txt) via requests.get, and also reads hardcoded base64-encoded strings within the exec statement.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted secret is executed via exec, which executes arbitrary code obtained from the decoded secret and remote URL. The URL fetch could potentially be malicious if the content is harmful or malicious code.",
  "flows": "Input flow: requests.get fetches code from remote URL. This data is base64-decoded, decrypted with a secret key, and then executed via exec. The secret key is derived from a hardcoded base64 string. The code is executed immediately upon import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec with dynamically fetched and decrypted code is highly suspicious, indicating possible remote code execution or malicious payload. The code bypasses static analysis and obscures its intent. The combination of external request, decryption, and exec suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools, which is normal for package setup. Immediately afterward, it imports requests, nacl.secret, and base64, and executes a decrypted payload obtained from an external URL. The use of nacl.secret.SecretBox with a base64-decoded key to decrypt the fetched content indicates obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The code then proceeds to run setup() with package metadata, which appears legitimate but is overshadowed by the preceding malicious-looking code that can run arbitrary code fetched from an external source. This behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, as it could execute malicious code during package import or installation. The code structure and use of secrets suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent or remote control behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains a highly suspicious and potentially malicious payload that fetches, decrypts, and executes remote code during import, which could be used to execute arbitrary malicious code. The setup portion is normal, but it is overshadowed by the malicious behavior initiated before it. The code is likely malicious or at least dangerous and should be reviewed carefully before use.",
