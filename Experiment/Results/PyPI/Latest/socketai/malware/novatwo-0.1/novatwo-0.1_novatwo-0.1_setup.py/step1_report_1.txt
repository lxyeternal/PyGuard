{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package named 'novatwo' with specific metadata and include a malicious execution that decrypts and runs remote code.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandraajvab/a/refs/heads/main/x.txt' for remote code, base64 decoding of encrypted payload, and the import statements for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decrypted code via exec(), which executes code fetched from a remote URL after decryption.",
  "flows": "The code fetches remote data with requests.get(), decodes and decrypts it using nacl.secret.SecretBox, then executes the resulting code with exec().",
  "anomalies": "The use of exec() on remotely fetched and decrypted data is highly suspicious; the decryption of secret payloads and execution without validation indicates malicious intent. Importing setup without calling it also serves to obfuscate or confuse.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with an import from setuptools, then proceeds to perform an insecure remote fetch, decode, and decrypt operations. The remote URL is dynamically fetched, and the decrypted payload is executed without any validation, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. The setup function is called only if the script is run directly, which is standard, but the embedded malicious code is highly suspicious. The code's structure suggests obfuscation or malicious intent to run arbitrary remote code at install time, constituting a supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior, executing remote code fetched over the network during setup, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent and a serious security risk. The overall behavior is highly suspicious and dangerous.",
