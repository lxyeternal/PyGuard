{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'novatwo', with an obfuscated dynamic code execution embedded.",
  "sources": "requests.get() to fetch remote content, b64decode() to decode encrypted data, and exec() to execute decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes decrypted code, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves a remote script, base64 decoding decodes encrypted data, then exec() runs the decrypted code, which is fetched from a remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on remotely fetched and decrypted data is highly unusual and suspicious. The code decrypts and executes remote content dynamically without any validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup from setuptools and then performs an insecure dynamic code execution sequence. It fetches a script from a remote URL, decodes it from base64, decrypts it using a secret key, and executes it directly. This behavior indicates possible malicious intent, as it allows remote control over the host system and bypasses static code review. The rest of the setup() call appears standard, but the embedded dynamic code execution poses significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains a malicious pattern: fetching, decrypting, and executing remote code at runtime. This can be used for malicious payload delivery, remote control, or code sabotage. The embedded dynamic execution is a security threat and should be considered malicious.",
