{
  "purpose": "The code fetches an encrypted payload from a remote URL, decrypts it using a hardcoded key, and executes it during package setup, indicating malicious intent such as remote code execution or backdoor access.",
  "sources": "requests.get() fetching remote content, base64 decoding, hardcoded decryption key, and the exec() function executing decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing remote and decrypted code, leading to potential arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch -> base64 decode -> decrypt with nacl.secret.SecretBox -> execute with exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded decryption key, remote code fetch during setup, execution of remote code via exec(), and obfuscation through encryption and remote fetching.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a remote fetch of encrypted data, decrypts it with a hardcoded key, and executes it during package setup, constituting a classic supply chain attack vector. All reports correctly identify this pattern. The use of exec() on remote code, combined with encryption, indicates malicious intent and obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-1, obfuscated ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.9-1) are appropriate given the severity. The behavior allows arbitrary remote code execution, posing a high security threat. The code should be flagged as malicious, and the scores should be set to maximum (malware=1, securityRisk=1, obfuscated=0.9) to reflect the severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing remote, decrypted code during package installation, representing a severe supply chain security threat. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and should be used to flag this package as dangerous.",
