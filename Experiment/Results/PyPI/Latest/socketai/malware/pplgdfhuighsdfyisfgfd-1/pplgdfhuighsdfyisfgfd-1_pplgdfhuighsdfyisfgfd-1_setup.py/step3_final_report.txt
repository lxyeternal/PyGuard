{
  "purpose": "The code executes a custom command during package setup phases that retrieves Google Cloud metadata tokens and exfiltrates them to an external webhook URL, indicating malicious exfiltration behavior.",
  "sources": "The `custom_command()` function, invoked during `install`, `develop`, and `egg_info`, reads data via `curl` commands executed through `os.system()`.",
  "sinks": "The external webhook URL (`https://webhook.site/...`) where the retrieved metadata token is sent, representing data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source: `custom_command()` retrieves metadata token via `curl`; Sink: the token is sent via `curl -X POST` to the webhook URL during setup phases.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of external network commands during package setup, exfiltration of sensitive cloud metadata tokens, use of `os.system()` for network activity, no hardcoded secrets but suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs an automatic retrieval of Google Cloud metadata tokens and exfiltrates them to an external URL during setup routines, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The straightforward implementation with `os.system()` executing shell commands to access internal metadata and send it externally constitutes a supply chain security risk. No obfuscation is present; the behavior is clear and intentional. The high malware (near 1) and security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by this exfiltration activity. The code's behavior could lead to unauthorized access, data leaks, or privilege escalation if exploited. The scores are consistent with the severity of the activity, and the behavior warrants high alert and removal from supply chain packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior involving automatic exfiltration of sensitive Google Cloud metadata tokens during package setup. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, and this behavior poses a significant security threat. It should be flagged for further review, and the package should be considered compromised or malicious.",
