  "conclusion": "The script is a command dispatcher with controlled command options, lacking embedded malicious code. Risks stem from reliance on external scripts and modules, especially with commands like 'nukeserver' that could be destructive if malicious. The malware score is low, but the potential for harm exists if external components are compromised. The overall security posture depends on the trustworthiness of external scripts and modules. Assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.4) reflects this assessment."
