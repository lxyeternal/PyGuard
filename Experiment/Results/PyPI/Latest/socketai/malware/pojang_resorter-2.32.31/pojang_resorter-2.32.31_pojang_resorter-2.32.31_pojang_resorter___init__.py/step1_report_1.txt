{
  "purpose": "Provides a package metadata and imports the main module for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The module imports 'main' from a local package; no external data sources or user inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data leaks are present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package initialization script, setting version and author metadata, and importing a main function. It contains no external data reading, no execution of dynamic code, no network activity, and no potential security vulnerabilities or malicious code. The simplicity and standard structure suggest a benign package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward package metadata and import setup with no malicious or security concerns identified. It appears to be a benign component of a larger CLI package.",
