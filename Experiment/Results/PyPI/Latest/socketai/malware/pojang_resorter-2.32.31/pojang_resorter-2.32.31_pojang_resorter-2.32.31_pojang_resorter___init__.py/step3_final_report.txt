{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a minimal package initialization script, setting metadata and importing the main module for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (__version__, __author__) and imports a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from setting metadata to importing the main module, with no external data or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It contains only static metadata and a simple import statement. There are no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for package entry points, and no anomalies or obfuscation are evident. Given its simplicity, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals point to a safe, standard package initialization script.",
