{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, primarily importing the main function and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the same package (.main), setting version and author variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external network or file operations",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; the code only imports a function and sets metadata",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and metadata variables. It does not process or handle external data, nor does it execute dynamic or unsafe operations. The import is from a local module, and no other logic or network activity is present. Given the limited scope, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply defines metadata and imports a core function for the CLI tool.",
