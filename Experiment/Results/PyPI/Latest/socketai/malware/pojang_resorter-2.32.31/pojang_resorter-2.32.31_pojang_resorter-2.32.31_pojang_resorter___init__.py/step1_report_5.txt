  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining package metadata and importing a main function from a local module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. The import statement suggests reliance on local code structure, and no runtime input or external data handling is shown. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a standard package metadata and entry point setup without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
