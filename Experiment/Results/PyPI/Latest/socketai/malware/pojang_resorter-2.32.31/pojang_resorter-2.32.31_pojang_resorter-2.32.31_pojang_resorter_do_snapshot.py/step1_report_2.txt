{
  "purpose": "Decompresses and executes base64-encoded, reversed data, likely to run obfuscated malicious code.",
  "sources": "Input data is the long base64-encoded string passed to the lambda function.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes the decompressed and decoded code, which could be malicious.",
  "flows": "Input string is reversed, base64-decoded, then zlib-decompressed, and finally executed via 'exec'.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated; uses lambda to dynamically import modules, reverse string, base64 decode, decompress, and execute. No comments or documentation, large encoded payload.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64', reverses the input string, decodes it from base64, decompresses it, and then executes the resulting code. The payload is a long, obfuscated string that is likely designed to hide malicious intent. The use of 'exec' on decompressed code poses a high security risk, as it can run arbitrary code. The obfuscation techniques strongly suggest malicious activity, aiming to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, designed to hide its true intent through multiple layers of obfuscation. It reads an encoded payload, decodes, decompresses, and executes it, which can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise.",
