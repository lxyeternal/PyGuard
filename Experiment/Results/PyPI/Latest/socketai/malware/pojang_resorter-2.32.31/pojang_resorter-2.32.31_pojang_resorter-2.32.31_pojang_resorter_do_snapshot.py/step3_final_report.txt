  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python code that decodes, decompresses, and executes a payload, likely malicious.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string, reversed string input",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decompressed code",
  "flows": "Input string reversed -> base64 decode -> zlib decompress -> exec",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via string reversal, dynamic import, immediate execution without validation",
  "analysis": "The code employs multiple obfuscation layers—string reversal, base64 decoding, zlib decompression—and then executes the resulting code with exec. This pattern is typical of malicious payload loaders designed to hide their true intent. The payload is unknown but likely malicious given the techniques used and the immediate execution of decompressed code. The high obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious activity. The code does not include benign behavior or validation steps, increasing risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It employs standard obfuscation techniques to hide malicious payloads and executes them dynamically, which is characteristic of malware loaders. The high obfuscation, combined with immediate execution of unknown code, warrants a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1.",
