{
  "purpose": "The code provides a CLI tool for interacting with a Minecraft or Mojang-related system, displaying ASCII art, help information, and command options.",
  "sources": "Input is obtained via command-line arguments parsed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "The code prints output to the console; no sinks are present for untrusted data beyond display.",
  "flows": "Input data from command-line arguments influences printed help and ASCII art display, but does not influence system or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The ASCII art and help output are static, and command parsing is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes color output, displays ASCII art, and provides command descriptions via argparse. There are no data leaks, network operations, or system modifications. The code does not handle user input beyond command-line arguments, nor does it execute dynamic or unsafe code. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. The code is purely for user interface display purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It simply displays ASCII art and help information with colored output. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
