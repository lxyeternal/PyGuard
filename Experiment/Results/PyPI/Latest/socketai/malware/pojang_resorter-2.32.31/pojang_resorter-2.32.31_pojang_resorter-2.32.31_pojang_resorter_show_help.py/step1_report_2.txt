{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface with ASCII art and colored help message for a Python-based tool related to Mojang interactions.",
  "sources": "argparse arguments (user input), colorama module initialization",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, no output to external systems or network",
  "flows": "User input via command line is parsed by argparse, which then displays help and ASCII art; no data is transmitted or stored",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of ASCII art and colored output appears benign. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display ASCII art and a help menu with command descriptions. The ASCII art and command descriptions are hardcoded. The code only displays help information and does not perform any system modifications, network communication, or data manipulation. No untrusted data is processed or stored. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help script with no malicious intent. It mainly outputs ASCII art and command descriptions, with no network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
