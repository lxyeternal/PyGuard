{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for a Python tool related to Mojang interactions, displaying ASCII art and help messages.",
  "sources": "Input is read via command-line arguments parsed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs ASCII art, command descriptions, and help messages to the console; no data is sent or received from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "User input through command-line arguments influences the printed help and ASCII art; no data flows to external systems or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The use of colorama for colored terminal output is benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama, defines a function to display help with ASCII art and colored text, and sets up argparse subcommands. It only performs terminal output with no external data handling, network communication, or secret management. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display with ASCII art and command descriptions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is standard, and no suspicious activity is evident.",
