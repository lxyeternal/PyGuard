{
  "purpose": "To provide a command-line interface for interacting with a Minecraft or similar server, displaying help information with ASCII art and colored text.",
  "sources": "Input data from command-line arguments parsed via argparse.",
  "sinks": "The argparse parser processes command-line inputs; no dangerous sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments flow from argparse to command handling, with ASCII art and help text output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard libraries and typical command-line parsing without suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (argparse, colorama), initializes colorama, defines a function to display help information with ASCII art and colored text, and sets up command-line subcommands. It only prints static ASCII art and command descriptions, with no data processing, network activity, or secret handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of CLI help display.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display script with no malicious intent. It only outputs ASCII art, colored headers, and command descriptions, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
