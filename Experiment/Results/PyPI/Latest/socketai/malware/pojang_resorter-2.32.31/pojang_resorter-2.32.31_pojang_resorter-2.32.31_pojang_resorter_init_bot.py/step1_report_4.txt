{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code intended to be dynamically decompressed and executed, likely to hide its true behavior.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided as a base64-encoded string within the code, which is then reversed and decoded.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decompressed code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution and malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code reads the base64-encoded string, reverses it, decodes it, decompresses it, and then executes the result directly via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated lambda function; code reverses a large base64 string, then decompresses and executes it. No clear explanation of the decompressed code content. Use of eval() pattern (exec) on decompressed data is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64', then reverses a large string, base64-decodes it, decompresses it, and executes the resulting code. This pattern indicates intentional obfuscation to hide malicious payloads. The use of exec() on decompressed data is highly suspicious, as it can run any arbitrary code. The large, reversed base64 string suggests it contains a payload that is not human-readable in this form, which is a common tactic to hide malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated to hide its true purpose, ultimately decompressing and executing arbitrary code. The pattern of reversing, decoding, decompressing, and executing points strongly toward malicious intent, possibly a backdoor or malware payload. Due to the obfuscation and execution of external code, this package should be considered potentially malicious and dangerous.",
