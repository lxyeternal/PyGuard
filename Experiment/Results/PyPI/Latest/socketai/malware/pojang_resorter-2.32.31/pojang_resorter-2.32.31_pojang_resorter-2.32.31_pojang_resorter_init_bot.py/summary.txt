  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and executes a payload decoded at runtime, which is characteristic of malicious or potentially malicious scripts. Given the obfuscation techniques and use of exec(), there is a high likelihood of malicious intent. Static analysis cannot confirm the payload's content, but the pattern warrants treating this code as malicious or highly suspicious. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, and further dynamic analysis of the payload is recommended."
