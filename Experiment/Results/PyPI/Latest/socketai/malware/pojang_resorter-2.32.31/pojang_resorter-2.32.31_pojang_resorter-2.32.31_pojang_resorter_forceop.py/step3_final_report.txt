  "purpose": "A script to connect to a Minecraft server via RCON and assign operator privileges to a specified user.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for username, server IP, RCON port, and RCON password.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'op {username}' command on the server via RCON, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "User inputs (username, server IP, port, password) → RCON connection → 'op' command execution → logging and output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an RCON connection using provided credentials, executes an 'op' command for the specified user, and logs the process. It handles exceptions properly. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The only security consideration is the handling of the RCON password via command-line arguments, which could be insecure if logs or process listings are exposed, but this is standard for CLI tools. The code performs a legitimate server administration function without obfuscation or malware. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, straightforward utility for managing Minecraft server operator privileges. It does not contain malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is low, primarily related to credential handling. No malicious intent or activity is detected.",
