  "purpose": "This script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server using RCON protocol.",
  "sources": "User inputs for username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password",
  "sinks": "The command execution via MCRcon that sends the 'op' command to the server",
  "flows": "User inputs -> assign_operator function -> MCRcon command 'op {username}' -> server response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network calls or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The script takes user inputs for username, server IP, port, and password. It uses these inputs to connect via RCON and execute an 'op' command to grant operator privileges to the specified user. The code logs connection attempts, success, or failure, and handles exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. The use of external library 'mcrcon' is typical for such tasks. The code performs expected functionality without hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate administrative tool to assign operator privileges on a Minecraft server. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks beyond the inherent need to handle sensitive credentials. Proper security practices should be followed to protect the RCON password, but the code itself is safe.",
