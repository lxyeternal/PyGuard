{
  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON protocol.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The 'mcr.command' method executes a server command ('op {username}'), which directly interacts with the game server.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in the command sent to the server; data flows from command-line input to server command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of external library 'mcrcon' is standard for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code securely gathers input parameters, establishes an RCON connection, and executes a command to assign operator status. Logging is used for monitoring. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior are present. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The only potential concern is the exposure of the RCON password via command-line argument, which may be insecure if not handled properly, but this is standard for CLI tools. Overall, the script performs a legitimate administrative task without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward administrative tool for assigning server operator privileges via RCON. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. Its security risk is low, with no significant threats identified. Proper handling of the RCON password and secure execution environment are recommended but beyond the scope of this review.",
