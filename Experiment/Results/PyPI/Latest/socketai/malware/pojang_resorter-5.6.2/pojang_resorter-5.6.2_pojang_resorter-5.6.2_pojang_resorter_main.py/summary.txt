  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, controlled CLI wrapper for server management scripts. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscated code. The main security considerations involve ensuring environment security and input validation to prevent misuse, especially of destructive commands. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.3) due to potential misuse of destructive commands and dynamic execution. Proper deployment controls are recommended to mitigate risks."
