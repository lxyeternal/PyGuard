  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for server scripts with controlled command mappings. It uses subprocess and dynamic imports but only for predefined commands. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate, given the potential for misuse if environment is compromised, but the code itself is benign.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, mostly related to environment and usage context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The script executes commands via subprocess and dynamic imports without extensive validation. While no malware is present, the potential for exploitation exists if an attacker can influence command inputs or if modules are malicious. The risk score of 0.4 aligns with these concerns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — moderate, due to dynamic execution and potential for environment compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, with focus on destructive commands like 'nukeserver'. The script itself is not malicious but can be dangerous if misused. The risk score of 0.4 is justified.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 — reflects potential damage, not malicious code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The script functions as a command dispatcher with potential risks if inputs are manipulated, especially for commands like 'nukeserver'. No malware or obfuscation detected. Risk score of 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, with focus on server management commands. No malicious activity or obfuscation. Risk score of 0.3 is appropriate, considering destructive commands.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n- **Security Risk:** 0.3.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and I concur. The code does not contain malicious payloads or behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports are 0, and the code is straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** They vary from 0.2 to 0.4, mostly reflecting the potential for misuse or destructive commands. Given the code's nature, I agree with these, but perhaps slightly overcautious in some cases.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — moderate, mainly due to the potential destructive commands ('nukeserver') and dynamic execution, but no evident malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard CLI wrapper for server management scripts, with controlled command mappings. It does not exhibit malware or obfuscation. The main concern is misuse of destructive commands if access is not properly restricted, but this is inherent to the functionality, not malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** Ensure proper access controls and input validation in deployment environments to mitigate risks associated with destructive commands.",
