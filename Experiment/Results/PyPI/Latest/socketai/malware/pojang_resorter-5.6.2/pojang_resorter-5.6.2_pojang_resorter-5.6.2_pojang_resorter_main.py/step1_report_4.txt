{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface to execute various server management commands by invoking other scripts or functions.",
  "sources": "User-provided command-line arguments ('command' and 'extra_args').",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution of Python scripts, dynamic import of functions from modules, logging actions, and printing outputs.",
  "flows": "User input (command) → conditional logic determines script or function to invoke → execution via subprocess or direct function call.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run scripts based on user input; dynamic importing of functions based on commands; no sanitization of inputs before execution; potential to execute arbitrary scripts if command mapping is manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts a command-line argument, maps it to specific script names or functions, and executes them either via subprocess or direct import. The command 'assign_operator' dynamically imports a function from 'pojangg_resorter.forceop', and 'nukeserver' imports from 'pojangg_resorter.nukeserver'. These functions are called directly without input validation beyond command matching. The subprocess calls execute scripts with the names derived from a predefined map, which reduces some risk but still relies on correct mapping. No evidence of hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The script's primary risk lies in executing arbitrary scripts or functions based on user input, especially if the command map is altered or if malicious scripts are present in the same directory. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity is detected. Overall, the code appears to be a command dispatcher for server management tasks with minimal inherent malicious intent, but the design could be exploited if the environment is compromised or inputs are manipulated.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a command dispatcher executing predefined scripts or functions based on user input. It does not contain malicious code or malware, but its reliance on dynamic execution and importing introduces potential security risks if not properly controlled. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident, but the structure warrants cautious deployment to avoid misuse or unintended script execution.",
