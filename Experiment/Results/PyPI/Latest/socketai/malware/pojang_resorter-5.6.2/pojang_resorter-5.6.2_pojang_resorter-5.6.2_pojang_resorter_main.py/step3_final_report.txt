  "purpose": "CLI tool to invoke server management scripts/functions based on user commands, including dynamic imports and subprocess execution.",
  "sources": "User command input, additional command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Execution of external scripts via subprocess, dynamic import calls to functions like assign_operator and nukeserver",
  "flows": "User command input -> command mapping -> subprocess call or dynamic import -> execution of scripts/functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with user-controlled arguments, dynamic imports based on command input without explicit validation, potential for destructive commands like 'nukeserver'",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a command dispatcher for server management scripts, mapping commands to scripts or functions. It uses controlled command choices, dynamic imports for specific commands, and subprocess calls for others. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. Risks stem from executing external scripts and dynamic imports, which could be exploited if environment or inputs are compromised. The code's design is straightforward and legitimate, with potential operational risks if environment controls are lax. The absence of hardcoded secrets or obfuscation indicates a benign intent. The primary concern is misuse of destructive commands like 'nukeserver' if proper access controls are not enforced. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, controlled CLI wrapper for server management scripts. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscated code. The main security considerations involve ensuring environment security and input validation to prevent misuse, especially of destructive commands. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.3) due to potential misuse of destructive commands and dynamic execution. Proper deployment controls are recommended to mitigate risks.",
