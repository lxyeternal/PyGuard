  "purpose": "The code locates 'libs/windows.exe' relative to its directory, checks for its existence, and executes it if present, with logging and exception handling.",
  "sources": "The path to 'libs/windows.exe' determined via os.path.join, and the existence check with os.path.exists.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True) where the external executable is run.",
  "flows": "Determine executable path -> check existence -> execute via subprocess -> handle exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or hardcoded credentials; execution of external binary without validation; use of random number in print (benign).",
  "analysis": "The script straightforwardly executes an external Windows executable located in a 'libs' subdirectory, with proper existence checks and exception handling. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is executing an unverified external binary, which could be malicious if supplied from an untrusted source. The code itself is benign, but the supply chain risk depends on the trustworthiness of 'windows.exe'. The malware score should reflect the potential risk of malicious payloads in the external binary, not the script. Scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate; a malware score around 0.4-0.5 and a security risk around 0.5-0.6 are justified due to lack of validation of the external executable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple launcher for an external executable with no malicious payload or obfuscation. The main security concern is executing an unverified binary, which poses a supply chain risk. The scores should reflect low inherent malware risk but moderate security risk due to external execution without validation.",
