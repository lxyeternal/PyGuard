{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, likely as a package entry point or module.",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' from a local module '.main', defines package metadata (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; minimal code structure with static imports and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package init file.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a main function from a local module and defines package metadata. There are no data inputs, no execution of untrusted data, and no dynamic code. No indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present. The package appears to be a standard module initialization script with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal package initializer with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
