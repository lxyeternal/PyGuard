  "purpose": "Minimal package initialization module for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, setting metadata and importing main functionality.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.main', setting __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network communication, or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "Import statement and metadata assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; straightforward structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package setup script with a docstring, an import statement, and metadata variables. No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Multiple reviews confirm the benign nature, with all scores for malware and obfuscation at 0 and very low security risk scores. The code does not contain anomalies or suspicious patterns. The only potential concern is the imported '.main' module, but based solely on this fragment, no malicious behavior is evident. The scores are consistent and appropriate, reflecting the benign and standard structure of a Python package's entry point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are correctly set to zero for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score. No further action is necessary.",
