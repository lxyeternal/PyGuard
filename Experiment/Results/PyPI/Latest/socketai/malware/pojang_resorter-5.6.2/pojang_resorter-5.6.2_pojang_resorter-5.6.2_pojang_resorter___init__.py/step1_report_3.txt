{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, package version, and author metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and sets metadata",
  "anomalies": "Lack of implementation code, only metadata and import; no suspicious or unusual code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a relative module, sets package version and author metadata. There are no data input or output operations, no dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or main module setup. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines metadata and imports a main function for the CLI tool. There are no signals of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
