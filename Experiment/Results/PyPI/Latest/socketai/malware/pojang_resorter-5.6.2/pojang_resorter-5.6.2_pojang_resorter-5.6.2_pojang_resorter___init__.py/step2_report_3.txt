  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a minimal module, likely `__init__.py`, importing `main` from `.main`.\n- It defines `__version__` and `__author__`.\n- No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, benign structure, no data flows, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning aligns with the code. The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable, given the minimal setup. Malware score of 0 is justified. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward import and metadata, benign.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No issues detected. The security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, minimal setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. No problems.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward import and metadata.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nMatches the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, standard package initialization.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:**  \n  No errors detected. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is justified given the code.  \n  The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct—no obfuscation detected.  \n  The security risk scores are very low or zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n- **Potential for Higher Risk Scores:**  \n  Since the code is purely metadata and import statements with no dynamic or external activity, increasing the scores would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the actual code behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a minimal, standard package module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and safe.",
