  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a docstring, a single import, and metadata variables (__version__ and __author__). There are no functions, no data input/output, and no external connections or data processing. It appears to be a straightforward module initialization with package metadata. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package metadata and import setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
