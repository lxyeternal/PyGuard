{
  "purpose": "The package provides functionality for a CLI tool called Pojang Resorter.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'main' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a module and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module-level docstring, import statement, and metadata variables (__version__ and __author__). It does not process any input, perform network communication, or execute dynamic code. The import statement imports a local module, which could contain more code, but this fragment alone shows no malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple package metadata and import structure with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and standard for a Python package module.",
