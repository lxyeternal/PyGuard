{
  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses the RCON connection to send the 'op' command to the Minecraft server, which can modify server permissions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the assign_operator function, which constructs and sends a command over RCON to grant operator privileges.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets; RCON password is obtained from command-line argument, which is standard but could be sensitive if not handled securely. Logging sensitive info like connection attempts; no data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely connects to a Minecraft server via RCON to assign operator privileges based on provided inputs. The logging captures connection attempts and errors but does not store or leak sensitive data beyond necessary operational logs. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The use of command-line arguments for sensitive credentials is typical but should be handled carefully in deployment. The core logic is straightforward and serves a legitimate administrative function.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a standard, legitimate operation of assigning operator rights on a Minecraft server. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. Overall security risk appears low, provided the inputs are securely managed.",
