{
  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password.",
  "targets": "Uses the RCON protocol to send an 'op' command to the Minecraft server, which can grant privileges.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into the assign_operator function, which then sends the command via the RCON connection to the server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code structures detected. Logging is standard. The code relies on external libraries but does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code reads sensitive input data (credentials, server details) from command-line arguments, which is typical for administrative scripts. It uses a well-known library (mcrcon) for RCON communication, which is expected in such contexts. The main action is sending an 'op' command to a server, which is a standard operation for server administration. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. The script performs straightforward server command execution based on user input.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate server administration utility with no signs of malicious intent. It securely handles inputs without hardcoded secrets, and the operation it performs is standard for server management. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
