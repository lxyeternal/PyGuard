  "purpose": "Assign operator privileges to a user on a Minecraft server via RCON connection.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments providing username, server IP, RCON port, and password.",
  "sinks": "The `mcrcon.command` method executing 'op {username}', which modifies server state.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from command-line arguments into the `assign_operator` function, which uses them to connect and send the 'op' command to the server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The code is straightforward and performs a standard administrative task.",
  "analysis": "The script takes user input for server credentials and username, establishes an RCON connection using the `mcrcon` library, and executes the 'op' command to grant operator privileges. It includes logging and error handling, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The command executed is a legitimate server operation. The code's security risk is low, primarily due to handling sensitive credentials via command-line arguments, which is typical but should be managed securely in deployment. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code's structure and purpose are clear, and the signals do not indicate any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, straightforward utility for managing Minecraft server operator privileges. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The security risk is minimal and acceptable for an administrative script, assuming proper credential management. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
