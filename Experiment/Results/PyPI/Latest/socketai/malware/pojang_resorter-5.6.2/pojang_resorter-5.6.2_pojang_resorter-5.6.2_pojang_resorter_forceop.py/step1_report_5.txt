{
  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command-line arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password.",
  "sinks": "Uses the RCON protocol to send an 'op' command to the server, which can elevate user privileges.",
  "flows": "User input (username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password) flows into the assign_operator function, which constructs and sends an 'op' command over RCON to the server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns. Logging configuration and exception handling are standard. No suspicious network activity is hardcoded; all data flows are typical for server management scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles user input via command-line arguments, with proper parsing and exception handling. It connects to a Minecraft server using RCON with provided credentials, issuing a command to assign operator privileges. The logging records connection and operation outcomes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code relies on the 'mcrcon' library to communicate with the server; usage appears straightforward and intended for legitimate server management.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs a legitimate administrative function—assigning operator privileges on a Minecraft server—without signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. It does not contain hidden backdoors, malicious commands, or suspicious data flows. Overall, it appears safe within its intended use case.",
