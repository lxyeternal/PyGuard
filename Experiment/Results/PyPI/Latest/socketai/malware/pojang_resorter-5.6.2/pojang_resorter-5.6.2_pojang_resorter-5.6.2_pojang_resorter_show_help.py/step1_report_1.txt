  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface (CLI) with help display and command options for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "Input is obtained from command-line arguments via argparse. No other data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code outputs ASCII art and command help text to the console.",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line arguments which are processed by argparse, then the ASCII art and help information are displayed. There are no data flows involving untrusted sources leading to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored console output, defines a function to display help with ASCII art and command options, and then calls this function in main. It only handles user input via argparse, displaying static help information with stylized ASCII art. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It solely outputs ASCII art and command options based on user input without any external data handling or sensitive operations.",
