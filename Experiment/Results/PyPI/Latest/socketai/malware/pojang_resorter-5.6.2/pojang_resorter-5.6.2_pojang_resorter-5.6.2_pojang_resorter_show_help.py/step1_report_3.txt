{
  "purpose": "Provide a command-line interface (CLI) help menu with ASCII art and colored text for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "User executes the script, which reads command-line arguments and imports modules (argparse, colorama).",
  "sinks": "Printing to console; no untrusted data output or external system calls observed.",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments influences the help display; data flows from input to printed output, but no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of colorama and ASCII art is benign. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a help display with ASCII art and command descriptions, and prints this help based on command-line arguments. It does not process or handle untrusted data beyond standard argument parsing. No network calls, no system modifications, no suspicious logic or obfuscation. Overall, the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a harmless CLI help utility that displays ASCII art and command options. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this code.",
