  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for a Python-Mojang interaction tool, displaying ASCII art, colorized headers, and available commands.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments parsed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "The argparse library handles command-line input; no external data sinks are used.",
  "flows": "User input (command) -> argparse parsing -> conditional help display with ASCII art and commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code detected. Usage of colorama is benign; ASCII art is decorative. No dynamic execution or external network interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output, then defines a function show_help() that displays ASCII art, colorized headers, and command descriptions. It uses argparse to define and print command options. There is no handling of external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated elements or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI tool for displaying help and command options with decorative ASCII art and colors. No malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The code appears intended for user assistance only.",
