  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and command help information for a CLI tool with colored output.",
  "sources": "Static ASCII art string, argparse command definitions, colorama initialization.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling.",
  "flows": "User command-line input parsed by argparse; static output generated; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama, defines a function to display ASCII art and help info with colored headers, and uses argparse for command parsing. It outputs static ASCII art and command descriptions without external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the script. The malware, security risk, and obfuscated scores are appropriately set to 0. The code serves solely aesthetic and help display purposes, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility with static ASCII art and command options. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The current assessment scores are accurate and appropriate.",
