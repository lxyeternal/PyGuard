  "purpose": "Analyze the setup.py configuration for potential malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on the inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' as package data.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, especially 'package_data' including 'libs/windows.exe'. No runtime code or dynamic behavior present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or code execution; the script is static and only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The static package configuration flows from the setup() parameters to the package installation process, with no runtime data flow or malicious payload execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' as package data; no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation within this script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with dependencies typical for multimedia and automation tasks. The inclusion of an executable file ('libs/windows.exe') is atypical but not inherently malicious. All reports correctly identify this as suspicious but lack evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores are zero, reflecting no malicious code detected. Security risk scores are low (0.2), acknowledging the suspicious executable but not confirming malicious intent. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or runtime behavior. The main concern is verifying the executable outside this script, as its purpose and safety cannot be determined from the setup.py alone.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign and standard, with the only notable anomaly being the inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe'. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk score (0.2) are appropriate, provided the executable is verified separately. Further inspection of the executable is recommended to confirm its safety.",
