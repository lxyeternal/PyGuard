  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign and standard, with the only notable anomaly being the inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe'. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk score (0.2) are appropriate, provided the executable is verified separately. Further inspection of the executable is recommended to confirm its safety."
