  "purpose": "This code exports an abstract sender class for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AbstractSender from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks; only module import and export",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module defining __all__ for public API exposure by importing AbstractSender from a local module. There is no input handling, no external data processing, and no suspicious code patterns. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python module with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply re-exports a class for use elsewhere.",
