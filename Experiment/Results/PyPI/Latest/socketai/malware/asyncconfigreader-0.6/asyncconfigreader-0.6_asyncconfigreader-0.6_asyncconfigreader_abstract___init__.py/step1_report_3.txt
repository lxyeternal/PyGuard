  "purpose": "Define the __all__ attribute for module exports, indicating that AbstractSender is the primary public interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AbstractSender from a relative module sender.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or potential data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import source flows directly to module scope; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and straightforward, with standard import and export declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module and sets the module's public API via __all__. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code structure is typical for Python modules defining exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
