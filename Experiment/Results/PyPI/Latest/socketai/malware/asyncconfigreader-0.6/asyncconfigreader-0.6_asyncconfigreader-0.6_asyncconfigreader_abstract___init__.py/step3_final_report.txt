  "purpose": "Re-export the AbstractSender class from the local sender module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "Import of AbstractSender from sender module; exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; minimal code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class and exposes it via __all__. No data flows from untrusted sources, no external communication, no obfuscation, and no malicious code are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal Python module that re-exports a class. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
