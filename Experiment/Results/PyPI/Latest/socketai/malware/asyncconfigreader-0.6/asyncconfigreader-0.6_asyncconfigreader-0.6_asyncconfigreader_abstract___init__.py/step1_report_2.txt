  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class named AbstractSender from a relative module 'sender' and sets __all__ for module exports. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that re-exports AbstractSender; it contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
