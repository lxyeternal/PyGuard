  "purpose": "Display a fake error message window using Windows API with configurable content.",
  "sources": "Message content from MessageConfig, read during Message class initialization.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Message class __create_message_window method calls windll.user32.MessageBoxW with MessageConfig data.",
  "anomalies": "Broad try-except block suppresses all exceptions silently; no validation or sanitization of MessageConfig content.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to show a Windows message box with configurable text, using standard Windows API calls. It does not process external inputs, perform network activity, or modify system files. The broad exception handling hides errors but is not malicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious API usage are present. The purpose appears to be for user notification or deception, but it is benign in nature. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign assessment, considering potential misuse for social engineering but no actual malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, benign, and intended for UI display. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
