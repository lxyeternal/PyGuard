  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'asyncconfigreader' package, specifying dependencies and package information.",
  "sources": "The 'install_requires' list specifying 'pynput==1.7.7'.",
  "sinks": "N/A - no code execution or data sinks are present in this script.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows or untrusted data processing occurs in this setup script.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard setup script with typical use of setuptools; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. The only dependency specified is 'pynput==1.7.7', a legitimate library for input device interaction. There are no code execution, data leaks, or malicious constructs present. The code structure and format are typical for a Python setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines the package name, version, dependencies, and packages to include.",
