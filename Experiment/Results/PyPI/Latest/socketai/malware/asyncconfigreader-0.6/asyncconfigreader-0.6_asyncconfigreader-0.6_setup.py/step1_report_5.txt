{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'asyncconfigreader', specifying its version, dependencies, and packages included.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings defining package metadata and dependencies; no input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the setup script is static and only declares package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious constructs or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies a fixed dependency on 'pynput==1.7.7' and automatically finds packages. There are no input data, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious code segments. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this setup script. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no malicious intent.",
