{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'asyncconfigreader' with a specific version and dependency on 'pynput==1.7.7'.",
  "sources": "The package name, version, and dependency list specified in the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No specific untrusted data sink points are present; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from the package metadata to the packaging system during installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present; the code is standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static parameters defining package name, version, required dependencies, and package discovery method. All elements are standard and straightforward. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, nor suspicious code patterns. The dependencies are explicitly specified, with no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. Overall, this appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate setup configuration without any anomalies.",
