  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input sources; static code with hardcoded package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, specifying package name, version, and a single dependency 'pynput==1.7.7'. It employs find_packages() for package discovery. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or untrusted input handling is present. The dependency is a legitimate library, and the script contains no suspicious constructs or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with high confidence, and assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The static nature and explicit dependencies confirm the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The dependency is legitimate, and there are no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
