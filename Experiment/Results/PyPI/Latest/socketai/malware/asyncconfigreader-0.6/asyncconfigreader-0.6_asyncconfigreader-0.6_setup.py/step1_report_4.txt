  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'asyncconfigreader'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools to configure package setup; static data in setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources; no data flow from external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or input processing; straightforward package setup flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a specific pinned version of pynput, but no suspicious code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or unusual code patterns. The dependency on pynput is explicit and version-locked, which is common in package requirements. No hidden or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical configuration file used in Python package distribution.",
