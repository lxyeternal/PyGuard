  "purpose": "Template for data sender with SSL verification control.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; potential invocation of _create_unverified_https which modifies SSL context.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; abstract class with no concrete data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The static method _create_unverified_https disables SSL certificate validation globally, which is a security concern if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class intended for subclasses to implement data transmission. The key concern is the method _create_unverified_https(), which overrides the default SSL context to disable verification, potentially exposing to man-in-the-middle attacks if invoked improperly. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The class itself is benign, serving as a template. The security risk stems from the potential misuse of the SSL bypass method, but the code does not perform any network operations or data leaks directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign abstract template with a utility method that disables SSL verification. While this introduces a security risk if misused, it is not malicious or obfuscated. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3 due to the SSL bypass. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no active malicious behavior is detected.",
