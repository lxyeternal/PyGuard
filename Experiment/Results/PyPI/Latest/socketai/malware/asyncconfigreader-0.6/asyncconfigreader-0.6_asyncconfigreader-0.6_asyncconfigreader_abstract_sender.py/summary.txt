  "conclusion": "The code is a benign abstract template with a utility method that disables SSL verification. While this introduces a security risk if misused, it is not malicious or obfuscated. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2-0.3 due to the SSL bypass. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no active malicious behavior is detected."
