  "purpose": "This code is setting up module imports and defining an export list for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing specific classes and enums from local modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard Python import syntax. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules and declares what symbols are exported. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or external inputs. The structure appears to be part of a larger package setup, typical for Python modules. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module import and export setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
