{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module's __init__.py file, which imports specific classes and enumerations from local modules to define the public API of the package.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes and enums from local modules (.ms, .enums, .utils). No external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet, as it only performs imports and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or external data; this code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and enums from internal modules, then exposes them via __all__. This is a typical pattern in Python package initialization files. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a Python package's public API. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Based on the limited snippet, it is safe.",
