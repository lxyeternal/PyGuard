{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enums from local submodules for use elsewhere, likely in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from .ms, .enums, and .utils modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports and defines __all__, which is standard for module exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only internal imports and exports are defined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to importing specific classes and enums and exposing them via __all__. It does not perform any processing, data handling, or network operations. It is a standard package initializer, with no suspicious or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization script that imports classes and enums for package export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
