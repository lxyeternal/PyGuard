  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a module initializer, importing classes and enums from internal modules and defining `__all__` for exports. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, external data handling, or other behaviors that could pose security risks.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Obfuscation:**  \n   None of the reports find any obfuscation or malware. The code is straightforward, with standard import statements, and no suspicious patterns or constructs. The malware score assigned is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the observed code.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly conclude that the code is a typical `__init__.py` style file serving as a package API interface.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Consistency:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. Their confidence levels are all 1, indicating certainty.\n\n**Critical Evaluation & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Given the simplicity and the absence of any suspicious or malicious activity, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is clear and standard; no obfuscation is present, so 0 is correct.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  The overall security risk is negligible; the code is purely structural and does not process or handle untrusted data. A score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Summary & Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The code is a standard module setup, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and poses no security concerns.",
