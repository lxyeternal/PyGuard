{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enumerations from local submodules for use in a larger Python package or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only contains import statements and an __all__ declaration, with no runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements that organize and expose specific classes and constants for external use. It uses relative imports, indicating it is part of a larger package. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or other activities that could indicate malicious intent. The __all__ declaration suggests it controls module exports for API clarity. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module initialization with standard import and export statements. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
