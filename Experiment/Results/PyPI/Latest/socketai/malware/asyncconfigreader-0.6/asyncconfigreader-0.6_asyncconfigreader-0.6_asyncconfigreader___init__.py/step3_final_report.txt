{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing specific classes and enums from internal modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.ms, .enums, .utils). No external data or input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py file that imports classes and enums from internal modules and defines __all__ for package exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior. There are no logical flaws or inconsistencies in the assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports' evaluations and scores are accurate and consistent. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
