{
  "purpose": "This code is responsible for re-exporting specific classes from its modules, likely as part of a package's public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .autostart, .message, .loader, .protector, .grabber",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes from sibling modules and defines the __all__ list for export. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious behavior. The structure is minimal and typical for Python package __init__.py files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving solely to re-export classes for public API access without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
