{
  "purpose": "This code imports several classes from local modules and defines an export list for a package, likely for modular functionality organization.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing is present; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles module imports and exports, which is standard for Python packages. It does not process input data, perform network operations, or include any suspicious logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues within this fragment. As this is a simple module initialization script, it is unlikely to contain malicious code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a Python package, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
