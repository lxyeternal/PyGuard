{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import interface, re-exporting specific classes from local modules for easier access elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations are present; no potential data leak points are identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output operations are present; the code only defines imports and an exported list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes from internal modules and defines an __all__ list for export. It lacks any input handling, data processing, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are detected. The structure and content appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initializer that re-exports classes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard part of a larger Python package.",
