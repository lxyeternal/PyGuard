  "purpose": "This code is used to re-export specific classes from local modules for easier access in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs import and export operations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns are present; the code is straightforward and typical for module exports",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from sibling modules and defines the public API via __all__. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior are detected. The structure is standard for Python packages intending to expose certain components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module re-export with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It does not contain any malware or obfuscated code. Overall, it is benign and typical for package API definition.",
