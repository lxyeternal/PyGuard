  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow or execution flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module that imports classes and defines an export list. It contains no dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or system modifications. Multiple reviews confirm its benign nature, with consistent scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initializer with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. The current scores and analysis are appropriate and should be maintained.",
