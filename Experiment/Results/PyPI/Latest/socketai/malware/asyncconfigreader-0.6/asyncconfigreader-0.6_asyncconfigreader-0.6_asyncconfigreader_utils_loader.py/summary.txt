  "conclusion": "The code pattern is inherently risky, enabling remote download and execution without validation, making it highly susceptible to malicious exploitation. The potential for misuse justifies high malware and security risk scores. It should be flagged as high risk in supply chain contexts, and modifications to include validation and safer execution practices are strongly recommended."
