{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the setup process for a Python package, including executing a test function during installation that loads and runs code from a zip archive.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, loading 'my.zip' via zipimport, and executing 'my.hello()' function within the test() function.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'my.hello()' which may invoke code within the 'my.zip' archive that could contain malicious code or unintended behaviors.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Loading and executing 'my.zip' via zipimport -> Calling 'my.hello()' within the loaded module.",
  "anomalies": "Loading and executing code directly from a zip archive during installation is unusual and potentially risky, especially if 'my.zip' is untrusted or malicious. The code does not specify how 'my.zip' is obtained or verified. The test() function is invoked during installation, which may execute arbitrary code contained within the archive.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a Markdown README file and defines a test() function that loads and executes a module from 'my.zip' via zipimport. During installation (via the custom 'LangInstall' class), test() is called, which loads and runs code from 'my.zip'. This behavior is atypical and potentially dangerous because executing arbitrary code from an archive during setup can lead to malicious code execution if 'my.zip' is compromised or malicious. There are no security checks, signatures, or validations of the zip archive. The setup configuration itself is standard, but the embedded dynamic code execution during installation is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes potentially untrusted code during package installation by loading and running 'my.zip'. This behavior poses a security risk if 'my.zip' is malicious or compromised. The approach of executing code from an archive during setup is unusual and can be exploited to run malicious code, making this a security concern.",
