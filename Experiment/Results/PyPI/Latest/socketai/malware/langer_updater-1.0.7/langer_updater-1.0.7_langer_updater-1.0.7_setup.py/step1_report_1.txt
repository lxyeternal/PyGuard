{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process for a Python package, including reading a README file, defining a test function that loads a module from a zip file, and executing this test during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' for long description. It loads a module from 'my.zip' via zipimport within the test() function.",
  "sinks": "The zipimporter loads code from 'my.zip', which could execute arbitrary code if the zip contents are malicious. The module's 'hello()' method is invoked, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The code loads 'my.zip' during installation, executes 'hello()' method from the module within it, which can execute arbitrary code if the zip file contains malicious content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of zipimport to load code from 'my.zip' during install is unusual; this could be a method to execute embedded malicious code. No validation of the zip contents or integrity checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a Markdown file for package description, then defines a 'test' function that loads and executes code from 'my.zip' via zipimporter, calling a 'hello()' function from that module. This function is invoked during the custom 'run' method of the install class, which is executed during package installation. The presence of dynamic code loading from a zip file during installation raises concerns, especially since the zip contents are not validated or inspected. This behavior can be exploited to run malicious code silently at install time, which is a common technique for malicious package behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present. The code does not appear obfuscated but employs dynamic code execution that can hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code's core suspicious element is loading and executing code from 'my.zip' during installation without validation, which could be exploited to run malicious code. This dynamic execution is an anomaly and warrants further investigation before trusting the package.",
