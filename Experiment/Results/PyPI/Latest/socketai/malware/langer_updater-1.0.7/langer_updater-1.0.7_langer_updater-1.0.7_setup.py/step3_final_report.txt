{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from 'my.zip' during installation without validation, which poses a significant security risk.",
  "sources": "Reading 'my.zip' via zipimport and executing 'hello()' from the loaded module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'hello()' from the unverified module, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "zipimport.zipimporter loads 'my.zip' -> importlib.util executes 'exec_module' -> calls 'module.hello()' -> executes code inside 'my.zip'.",
  "anomalies": "Loading and executing code from an external archive during setup without validation or signature checks.",
  "analysis": "The code loads 'my.zip' during setup using zipimport without any validation, then executes 'hello()' from it. This pattern allows arbitrary code execution at install time, which can be exploited maliciously. The behavior is suspicious and aligns with common supply chain attack vectors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.8, security risk ~0.75-0.85) are appropriate given the high potential for malicious activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. Overall, this pattern is dangerous and should be flagged as high risk unless 'my.zip' is from a trusted source and verified.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior by executing unverified external code during installation, representing a significant security concern. The assigned scores are justified; the pattern should be avoided or secured with validation to prevent supply chain attacks.",
