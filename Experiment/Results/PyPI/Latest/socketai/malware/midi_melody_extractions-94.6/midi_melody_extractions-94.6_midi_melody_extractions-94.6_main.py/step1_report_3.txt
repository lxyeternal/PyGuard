  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, encode MAC addresses, and send this data to specific external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network configuration and hardware info.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending constructed URLs containing system info data to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources, encoded (base64 for MAC addresses), appended as URL parameters, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external domains with obscure names; encoding of MAC addresses; no validation or authentication for outgoing requests; minimal error handling; usage of platform-specific commands to fetch MAC addresses which may be sensitive or potentially exploitable if mishandled.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system metadata such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, then all data is sent to a set of suspicious-looking URLs via HTTP GET requests with parameters. The URLs are obscure and potentially malicious. No data is processed or stored locally beyond encoding. No sensitive credentials or tokens are hardcoded, but the communication pattern indicates potential for tracking or exfiltration of system information. No malicious system modifications or destructive actions are present. The code's primary concern is its covert data exfiltration behavior rather than direct malware activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears designed to collect system information and send it to potentially malicious external servers, indicating a data exfiltration or tracking attempt. While it does not contain direct malware behaviors such as code execution, file manipulation, or network backdoors, its behavior is suspicious and could be used as part of a malicious supply chain attack or privacy violation. It warrants caution and further investigation.",
