  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, encode MAC addresses in Base64, and send this data to multiple remote URLs with unique identifiers.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading system info and executing shell commands), random.randint(), base64.b64encode()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to remote URLs",
  "flows": "System info is collected from sources, MAC addresses are encoded, then parameters are constructed and sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Usage of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domains, encoding of MAC addresses without validation, no response handling or logging, minimal exception handling (silently passing errors). The URLs point to domains associated with obfuscated or potentially malicious activity. No input validation for system info or data transmitted.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system data such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are obtained by executing system commands and then encoded with Base64. The code constructs URLs with these parameters and appends a random number as a query parameter, then makes HTTP GET requests to remote servers. The URLs are suspicious, indicating possible data exfiltration. There is no validation of the responses, and exceptions are silently ignored, which could hide failures. The data transmission pattern and use of obfuscated domain names suggest potential malicious intent or at least covert data collection. No malicious code execution or system damage is evident, but the behavior aligns with data exfiltration tactics.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for covertly collecting and transmitting system information, including MAC addresses, to remote servers under suspicious domains. The use of URL encoding, Base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and unprotected data transmission suggest malicious or privacy-invasive intent. Although there is no direct evidence of active malware such as system damage or backdoors, the code’s behavior is consistent with data exfiltration tools. Confidence is high in identifying data collection and exfiltration patterns, but low in confirming malicious intent without further context.",
