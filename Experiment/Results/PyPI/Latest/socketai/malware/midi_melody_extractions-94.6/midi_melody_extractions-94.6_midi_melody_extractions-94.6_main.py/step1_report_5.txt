  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to remote URLs with encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (calls subprocess for system commands), random.randint(), base64.b64encode()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for remote URL requests with query parameters containing collected data",
  "flows": "Source functions (system info, MAC addresses, random number, encoding) -> URL parameter construction -> urlopen() request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True for system commands (potential command injection), hardcoded suspicious URLs with .cn and .fun domains, encoding of MAC addresses before transmission, no validation or filtering of data, no checks for secure connections (HTTP only), silent exception handling without logging",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses via system-specific commands. It encodes MAC addresses using base64 before sending. The script constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or suspicious domains and makes GET requests with query parameters containing system info. The use of subprocess with shell=True may pose security risks if manipulated, although in this context, it appears used for system info collection only. The URLs are non-standard and suspicious, indicating possible data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The exception handling does not log errors, which is typical in malicious scripts trying to avoid detection. Overall, the script appears designed to stealthily collect and transmit system data to remote servers, suggesting malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to covertly collect and send system information to external servers with suspicious domains. It encodes sensitive data, uses system commands with potential security implications, and lacks proper validation or security measures. These behaviors indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
