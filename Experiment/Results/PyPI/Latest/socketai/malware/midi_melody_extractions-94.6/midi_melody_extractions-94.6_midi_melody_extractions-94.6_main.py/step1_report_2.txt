  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to a set of external URLs with encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system commands, random.randint() for generating request IDs.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send HTTP GET requests with system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) are collected, encoded, and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains (e.g., oast.cn, oast.fun) known for testing or malicious activity; encoding MAC addresses in base64 and transmitting them without user consent; no user prompts or warnings; exception handling that suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The code collects MAC addresses by executing system-specific commands, which could be used for device fingerprinting. The data is base64-encoded and sent to multiple external servers via GET requests, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance. The URLs used are suspicious, and there are no indications of user consent or legitimate purpose. The code does not perform any malicious actions directly like modifying files or executing harmful commands but has significant privacy implications. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or malicious intent behaviors such as reverse shells or data exfiltration are directly observed, but the data collection and transmission pattern are typical in tracking or malicious reconnaissance scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script collects system information and transmits it to external domains without clear user consent, which raises privacy concerns. While it does not exhibit overtly malicious actions like malware deployment, the behavior suggests tracking or reconnaissance activity that could be misused. The use of suspicious domains and silent data exfiltration points to potentially malicious intent, with a low confidence that it is benign.",
