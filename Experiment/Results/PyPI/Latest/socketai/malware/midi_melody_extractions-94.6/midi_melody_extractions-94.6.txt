      "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. While the code itself is straightforward, this behavior could be exploited to run harmful code without user consent. The current scores are reasonable but could be slightly increased to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, especially if 'main.py' is untrusted. Further review of 'main.py' is recommended before distribution."

      "conclusion": "The script functions as a covert data exfiltration tool, collecting system info and MAC addresses, encoding them, and sending the data to suspicious external domains. While it does not contain active malicious payloads like code execution or backdoors, its behavior indicates malicious intent related to privacy invasion and reconnaissance. The high security risk score is justified due to the covert nature and external communication to suspicious domains. The malware score, reflecting potential malicious activity, is moderate, acknowledging the covert exfiltration without active payloads. Overall, the code warrants caution and further monitoring, especially considering its potential misuse in malicious contexts."
