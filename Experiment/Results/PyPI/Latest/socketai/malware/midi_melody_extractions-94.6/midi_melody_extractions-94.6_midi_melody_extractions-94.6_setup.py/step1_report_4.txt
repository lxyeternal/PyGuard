  "purpose": "Configure package setup and define custom installation behavior that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from setuptools, including the custom class CrazyInstallStrat which imports and runs main() from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() from main.py during install, which could run arbitrary code if main.py contains malicious instructions.",
  "flows": "The install process triggers CrazyInstallStrat.run(), which then executes main() from main.py, potentially executing arbitrary code during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code from main.py during setup, which is unusual and could be malicious if main.py contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It defines a custom installation class that, after completing the standard install, imports and executes main() from main.py. This behavior is unusual because it executes external code during installation, which can be a vector for malicious activity if main.py is compromised or maliciously crafted. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present. The code itself does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators but the act of executing main() during install poses a potential security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a function from main.py during installation, which could be malicious if main.py is malicious. The setup itself appears legitimate but the post-install execution of external code is a security concern. This pattern should be reviewed carefully for malicious intent.",
