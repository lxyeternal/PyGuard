  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. While the code itself is straightforward, this behavior could be exploited to run harmful code without user consent. The current scores are reasonable but could be slightly increased to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, especially if 'main.py' is untrusted. Further review of 'main.py' is recommended before distribution."
