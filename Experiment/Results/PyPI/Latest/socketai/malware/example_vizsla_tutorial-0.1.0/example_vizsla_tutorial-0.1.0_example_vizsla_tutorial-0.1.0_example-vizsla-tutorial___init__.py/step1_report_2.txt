{
  "purpose": "Provides simple logging and arithmetic functions, likely for basic utility within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' in simple_math_operation function.",
  "sinks": "Return value of simple_math_operation; print statement in log_message function.",
  "flows": "Input 'a' and 'b' flow into the addition operation, output returned; print statement outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two simple functions: one for logging a static message and another for adding two values. There are no inputs from external sources beyond function parameters, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious behaviors observed. The functions appear benign and intended for basic utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard utility code without vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
