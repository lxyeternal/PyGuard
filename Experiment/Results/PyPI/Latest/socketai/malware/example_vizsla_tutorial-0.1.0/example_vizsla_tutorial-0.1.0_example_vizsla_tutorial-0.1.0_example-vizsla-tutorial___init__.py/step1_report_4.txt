{
  "purpose": "Provides basic logging message and simple addition operation",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for the simple_math_operation function",
  "sinks": "Return value of simple_math_operation, print statement in log_message",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into the addition operation, result is returned; print outputs a static message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no unusual code patterns or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: one for printing a static log message and another for adding two inputs. The inputs are used straightforwardly without sanitization or external data sources. No external network access, no file I/O, and no complex logic are present. The code performs simple, benign operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs basic functions, and shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
