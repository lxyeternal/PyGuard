{
  "purpose": "The code provides two utility functions: one for logging a static message and another for adding two numbers. It appears intended for basic logging and mathematical operations within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The functions read input parameters 'a' and 'b' for the addition function; the log_message() function does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into simple_math_operation() and are returned; log_message() outputs a static string. No external data flows are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions: one prints a static message, the other performs addition. There are no external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The functions are benign and serve basic utility purposes. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code poses no security threat and is safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple utility functions with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
