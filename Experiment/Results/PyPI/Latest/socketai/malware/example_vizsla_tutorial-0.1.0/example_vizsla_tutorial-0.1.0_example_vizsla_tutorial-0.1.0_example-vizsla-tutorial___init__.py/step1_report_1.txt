{
  "purpose": "Provides simple logging and mathematical addition functions.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' in 'simple_math_operation', and the standard output in 'log_message'.",
  "sinks": "Standard output in 'log_message'; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into 'simple_math_operation' and produce output; 'log_message' prints a static message with no external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward with no hidden or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions: one that logs a static message to the console and another that performs addition. There are no external data reads, no untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The functions are benign and perform basic operations only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a simple utility module with benign intent.",
