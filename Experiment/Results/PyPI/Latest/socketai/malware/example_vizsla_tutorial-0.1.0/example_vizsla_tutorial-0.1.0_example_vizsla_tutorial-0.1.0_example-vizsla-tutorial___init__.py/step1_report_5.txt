  "purpose": "The code provides basic functions for logging a message and performing a simple addition operation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' in simple_math_operation function, and the print statement in log_message.",
  "sinks": "Return value of simple_math_operation; output to console in log_message.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters 'a' and 'b' to the return statement; from print statement to console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two straightforward functions: one prints a static message, the other performs addition. There are no input validation, no external data reads, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The functions do not interact with external systems, network, or sensitive data. The code appears to be simple utility functions with benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs basic logging and mathematical operations without any suspicious or harmful patterns.",
