  "purpose": "Provides simple logging message and basic addition function",
  "sources": "Input parameters a and b in simple_math_operation",
  "sinks": "Return value of simple_math_operation, print statement in log_message",
  "flows": "Input parameters a and b flow into the addition operation; no external data flows into the system beyond function inputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The print statement is benign and for informational purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one prints a static message to the console, and the other performs a basic addition. There are no external data reads, no network communication, and no use of environment variables or sensitive data. The functions do not invoke any insecure operations or malicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears to be simple, safe, and intended for basic functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior. It provides straightforward utility functions without any security risks or suspicious activity.",
