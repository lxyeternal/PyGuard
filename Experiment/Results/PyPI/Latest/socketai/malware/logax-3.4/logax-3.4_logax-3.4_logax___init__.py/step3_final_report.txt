{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from a local module named 'info' using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import brings symbols into the namespace but does not execute code or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and namespace pollution; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import of all symbols from 'info'. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity is evident. The use of 'import *' is discouraged for clarity but is not inherently malicious. Without inspecting 'info', potential hidden issues cannot be ruled out, but based solely on this line, the code appears benign. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the stylistic concern rather than a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which is stylistically discouraged but not a security issue. The code's security risk is very low, and no malware is present.",
