{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the 'info' module within the same package, likely to access certain data or functions defined there.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which pulls in code/data from a local module ('info').",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this line; however, imported data could potentially be used elsewhere in the package.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'info' module into the current module through the import statement; no further flow is visible in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' is generally discouraged due to potential namespace pollution, but this is not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is evident in this line alone.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import of all contents from the 'info' module within the same package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues in this import statement by itself. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity or security risks can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard relative import from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this statement. Additional code review would be needed to assess further potential issues.",
