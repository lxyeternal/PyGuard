{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module '.info', likely to utilize its variables or functions.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the module '.info' within the package.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or data outputs in this line.",
  "flows": "The imported contents from '.info' could potentially be used elsewhere in the code, but no flow is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a relative import with a wildcard ('*'), which can obscure the imported names and make it harder to analyze dependencies. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are visible here.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement with a wildcard, which is a common practice for importing multiple names but can lead to namespace pollution and hidden dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity within this single line. Since this is just an import, the security risk depends on the contents of the '.info' module, which are not provided. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement does not indicate malicious intent or security risks by itself. However, the use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged for clarity and security. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
