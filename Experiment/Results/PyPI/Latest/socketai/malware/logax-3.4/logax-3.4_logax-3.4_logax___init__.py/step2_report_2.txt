  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .info import *`.\n- None of the reports identify any actual malicious activity, code execution, or suspicious behavior directly from this line.\n- The main concern raised is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure what symbols are imported and potentially hide malicious or unintended code.\n- No reports mention any anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code within the `info` module itself.\n- The confidence levels are mostly high (0.6 to 0.9), indicating the reviewers believe the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code is a simple import statement. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident from this line alone.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The main flaw is the use of `import *`, which is discouraged in Python because it pollutes the namespace and can hide dependencies. However, this is a style/quality concern, not a security flaw.\n- **Scores review:**\n  - Malware scores are all zero, consistent with the reports.\n  - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1–0.2), which aligns with the benign nature.\n  - Obfuscated scores are zero, as expected.\n  - Confidence levels are high, reflecting the reviewers' assessments.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware risk:** Since no malicious code or behavior is present, malware scores should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation is indicated; scores are correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, overall security risk should be very low, around 0.1 or less, which matches the reports.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports do not consider the contents of the `info` module. If `info` contains malicious code, then the import could be dangerous, but this cannot be inferred from the import line alone.\n- The use of `import *` can be problematic if the `info` module contains malicious symbols, but again, this is speculative without further context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code and no malicious activity, a low risk score of about 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment. The only point of contention might be the use of `import *`, which is stylistically discouraged but not inherently malicious or risky in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context or code, this import statement alone does not pose a security threat. The overall security posture depends on the contents of the `info` module, which is not available here.",
