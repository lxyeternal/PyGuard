  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a relative import from a local module named `info`.\n- It uses a wildcard import (`*`), which is discouraged in Python because it pollutes the namespace and obscures what symbols are imported.\n- There are no other code constructs, data flows, or suspicious activities visible in this snippet.\n- The actual contents of `info` are unknown, so potential malicious behavior could be hidden there, but cannot be inferred solely from this line.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the import of all symbols from `info`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that no malicious behavior is evident from this line alone.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Confidence: 0.6 (moderate)\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 (low)\n  \n**Assessment:** The low malware and security risk scores are justified. The use of `*` is noted but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that this is a standard relative import, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Confidence: 0.7 (higher confidence)\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n  \n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes the benign nature of the import statement.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Confidence: 0.9 (high confidence)\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n  \n**Assessment:** The high confidence is justified given the simplicity of the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states that the import is not suspicious and that no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Confidence: 0.9\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (very low)\n  \n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes that wildcard imports can obscure dependencies but are not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Confidence: 0.6\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n  \n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable, considering the potential for namespace pollution but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity in this import statement.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified, reflecting minimal security concerns solely from this import.\n\n**Potential improvements:**\n- The use of `import *` can be flagged as a best practice concern, but not a security risk per se.\n- Without knowledge of `info`, we cannot assess whether the imported symbols are malicious, but from this snippet alone, the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### **Final System-Level Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (a slight concern due to namespace pollution, but not security-critical)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a simple relative import with a wildcard, which is generally discouraged but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. No changes to scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**Work-out Summary:**\n- The code is not malicious.\n- The risk is minimal.\n- The use of `import *` is a stylistic concern but not a security issue.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as is, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
