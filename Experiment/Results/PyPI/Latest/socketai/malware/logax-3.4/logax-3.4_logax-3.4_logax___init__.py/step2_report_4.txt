  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their findings, scores, and implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports concern a single line: `from .info import *`.\n- No other code is provided, so our assessment is limited to this import statement.\n- The primary concern with such imports is potential namespace pollution, obscured dependencies, or malicious code hiding within the imported module.\n- None of the reports identify any actual malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The confidence levels are mostly high (0.6 to 0.9), but the overall risk and malware scores are low (mostly 0 to 0.2).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** The import statement is present in all reports, and the code matches the original code snippet.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity is provided or implied.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** The reports correctly identify that the line is a simple import, with the main concern being the use of `import *`.\n\n### Specific points per report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that `import *` can obscure symbols but considers the risk low.\n- **Justification for risk:** Since no malicious activity is evident, a low risk score (0.2) seems reasonable.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Also correct; no malicious activity or security issues are apparent.\n- **Score adjustment:** The risk score could be slightly increased to 0.1 to reflect the general caution about wildcard imports, but 0 is acceptable.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, appropriate and consistent.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk due to the wildcard import, but still low. This is reasonable.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior reasoning; the use of wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** All are correctly at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the context, a risk score of 0.1 to 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting the potential issues with wildcard imports but no actual threat.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which is a style and clarity issue rather than a security threat.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or activity.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import, which can cause namespace pollution but is not inherently dangerous)\n\n**Summary:** The import statement is benign in isolation. The main improvement would be to avoid `import *` for clarity and maintainability, but from a security perspective, there is no issue.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of the imported module to ensure it does not contain malicious code, but based solely on this import statement, there are no security concerns.",
