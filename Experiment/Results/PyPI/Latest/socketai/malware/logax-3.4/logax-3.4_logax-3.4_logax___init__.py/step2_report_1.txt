  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that this is a simple relative import of all symbols from a local module named 'info'.\n- There are no other code constructs, no data input, no network operations, no code execution, or suspicious patterns visible.\n- The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious.\n- Without access to the contents of 'info', we cannot determine if the imported module contains malicious code or secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on issues present:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that this is a relative import of all symbols from 'info'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or code execution.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports do not identify any actual security flaws or malicious activity stemming from this line alone. They correctly note that 'import *' can obscure the namespace but is not inherently malicious.\n- No report claims or implies that the 'info' module contains malicious code; they only discuss the import statement itself.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Confidence scores:** Range from 0.6 to 0.9, which seems reasonable given the minimal code.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious activity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly low (0.1 to 0.2), which is appropriate for a benign import statement.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nThe scores seem consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- The overall risk score is low because this line alone does not perform any malicious activity.\n- The malware score is 0, correctly indicating no malware.\n- The use of 'import *' is a stylistic concern but not a security threat here.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the reports are cautious and correct.\n- Since the code is just an import statement, there is no basis for suspecting malicious intent unless the 'info' module itself is malicious, which cannot be determined here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since the use of 'import *' can be considered a minor issue, but not a security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but not malicious. The code's security risk is minimal, and no malware is present.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or context is needed.",
