{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from a module named 'info' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .info module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious behavior observed",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to the import process from a local module",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered suspicious due to potential obscurity, but is common in Python packages for convenience; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns identified",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement using relative import syntax. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modifications. The use of 'import *' is sometimes discouraged but not inherently malicious. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or security risks in this snippet. Given the minimal content, there is no indication of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose appears to be to include definitions from a local 'info' module.",
