  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing symbols from 'info'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') can be considered unusual as it can introduce unknown or unintended symbols into the namespace, which may obscure malicious or harmful code. However, in this context, it simply imports all symbols from a local module.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing all symbols from a module named 'info'. There are no other code constructs, no data input handling, no network operations, or code execution present. The use of a wildcard import can sometimes be suspicious in larger or untrusted codebases, but in a controlled or local context, it may be benign. Without access to the contents of 'info', no malicious behavior can be identified directly from this line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident from this line alone. The use of a wildcard import is not inherently malicious but can sometimes hide risky or unintended code. Overall, the risk is low.",
