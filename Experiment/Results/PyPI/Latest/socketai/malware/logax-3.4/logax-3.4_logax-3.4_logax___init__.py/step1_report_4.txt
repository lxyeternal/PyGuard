{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module from the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present; however, imported data could potentially be used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'info' module into the current namespace via import *.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can obscure what data is imported, but this is common in some codebases. No other unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement. There are no input sources such as user input, network data, or environment variables. No sinks or data exfiltration points are visible within this snippet. The import statement alone is not suspicious; it simply includes code from a local module. Without additional context or code that utilizes imported data, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard import statement that loads code from a local module. No anomalies, malware, or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
