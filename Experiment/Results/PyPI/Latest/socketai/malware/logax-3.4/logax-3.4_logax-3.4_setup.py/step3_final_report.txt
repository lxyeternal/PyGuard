  "purpose": "Standard setup script for Python package 'logax', defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs handled.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated code. Dependencies are common libraries ('requests', 'pybase64'). The author and author_email fields are empty, which is unusual but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, justified by the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No modifications are necessary.",
