  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (HTTP requests to external servers)",
  "flows": "Collect system info from sources, construct URL with parameters, send HTTP request to each URL in the list",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, collection and transmission of hostname, username, current directory, and a random number without user consent or encryption, potential data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs embedding these parameters and sends requests to external domains. The domains appear suspicious and possibly malicious. The data transmission occurs unencrypted and without user notification, indicating potential data exfiltration. No input validation or user consent mechanisms are present. The code does not perform any harmful system modifications but actively transmits system info to remote servers, which could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for covert data collection and exfiltration, suggesting malicious intent. It contacts suspicious domains and transmits system info without user awareness, indicating a high malicious potential.",
