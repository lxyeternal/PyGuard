  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs for tracking or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node() (hostname), getpass.getuser() (username), os.getcwd()() (current directory), random.randint() (random number)",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (sending data to external URLs)",
  "flows": "hostname, username, current_path, rd_num → full_url → urllib.request.urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "Use of external URLs that appear suspicious or controlled by a third party; sending system info to these URLs; no user consent or encryption; hardcoded URL domains that are suspicious; dynamic URL construction with user/system info.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or tracking domains. It then performs HTTP GET requests to these URLs with system info as query parameters. The data flow indicates potential privacy violation and unauthorized data exfiltration. The URLs do not appear legitimate and may be used for tracking or malicious purposes. No encryption or user consent is present. The code has no obfuscation but exhibits suspicious external communication behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates system information to external, suspicious domains without user consent, indicating malicious intent related to tracking or privacy invasion. The external URLs and data collection are suspicious and potentially malicious.",
