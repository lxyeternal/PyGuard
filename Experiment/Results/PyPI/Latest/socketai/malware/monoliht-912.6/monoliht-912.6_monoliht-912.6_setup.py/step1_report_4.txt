  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'monoliht' Python package, including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class, which imports and executes 'main' from 'main'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run' method executes code from an external module ('main') during installation, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that extends setuptools' install command. During installation, it imports and executes a 'main' function from a 'main' module. This behavior could be used to run arbitrary code upon package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main' contains harmful instructions. The setup configuration appears standard, but the invocation of external code during setup is atypical. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'install_requires' and 'setup_requires' is normal. Overall, the code executes external code at install time, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if the 'main' module is compromised or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main concern is executing an external 'main' function during package installation, which could be used maliciously to run arbitrary code. While no explicit malicious code is visible here, the behavior is potentially dangerous and warrants caution. There is no evidence of obfuscation or malware, but the design pattern used is suspicious.",
