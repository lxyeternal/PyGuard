  "purpose": "Set up and install the 'monoliht' package, including executing custom post-installation code.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method of the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class calls 'from main import main' during installation.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'main()' function after installation; potential risk if 'main' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "Installation process invokes 'CrazyInstallStrat.run()', which imports and executes 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "Custom install command executes code ('main()') during setup, which is unusual and could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, upon running, imports and executes a function 'main' from the 'main' module. This occurs during the package installation process, which is uncommon and potentially dangerous if 'main()' performs malicious actions. The code does not show the content of 'main', so its behavior is unknown. The code structure itself is straightforward and uses standard setuptools mechanisms, but the execution of external code during install is suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external network activity are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a 'main()' function from an imported module during installation, which could be malicious depending on the implementation of 'main'. The pattern is unusual for legitimate setup scripts and warrants further investigation of 'main'.",
