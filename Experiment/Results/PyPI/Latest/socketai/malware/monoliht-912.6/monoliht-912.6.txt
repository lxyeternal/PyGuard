      "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant security risk. While the actual content of 'main()' is unknown, this practice should be treated with caution, and the package should be reviewed thoroughly before use."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert collection and transmission of system information to suspicious external domains, indicating malicious or highly suspicious activity. While no active malicious payloads are present, the exfiltration behavior and suspicious URLs justify high security and malware concern scores. The code should be treated as malicious or at least highly suspicious, warranting further analysis or blocking."
