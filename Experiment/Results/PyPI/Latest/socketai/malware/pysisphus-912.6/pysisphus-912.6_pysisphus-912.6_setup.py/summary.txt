  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, as it can run arbitrary, potentially malicious code. This pattern is a known supply chain attack vector. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It is recommended to avoid such practices, validate 'main.py' contents, and prevent code execution during setup unless explicitly necessary and secure."
