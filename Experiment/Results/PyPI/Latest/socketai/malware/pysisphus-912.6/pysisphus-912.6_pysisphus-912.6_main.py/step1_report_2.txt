  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number.",
  "sinks": "Performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs with embedded system data as query parameters.",
  "flows": "System info -> URL encoding -> HTTP request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded URLs that appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate package functions. The data sent includes hostname, username, and current directory, which could be sensitive. The use of random number in URL path may be for tracking or obfuscation. No user input is directly involved, but system info is being exfiltrated.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system info (hostname, username, current working directory) and sends this data to several URLs controlled by an external entity. The URLs have suspicious, non-standard domains, indicating possible malicious intent. The data transmission occurs unconditionally, and there's no obvious legitimate reason for such external contact. The code does not perform any apparent functionality related to a legitimate package; it seems designed to track or exfiltrate user environment details covertly. There are no indications of obfuscation, backdoors, or other malicious payloads beyond data exfiltration. The use of try-except ensures that errors do not halt execution but does not mitigate the malicious intent of the network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects and transmits system information to external servers, indicating malicious intent related to user tracking or data theft. The suspicious URLs and the nature of data sent are consistent with malicious behavior. Overall, the code is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
