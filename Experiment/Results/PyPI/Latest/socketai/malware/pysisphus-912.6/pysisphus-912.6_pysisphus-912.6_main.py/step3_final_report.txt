  "purpose": "Collect system info and send to remote URLs, likely for malicious data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external suspicious URLs",
  "flows": "System info variables are encoded into URL parameters and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious external URLs, data sent without user consent, no obfuscation or payloads, no input validation",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters and makes HTTP requests to three suspicious domains. The URLs are unrelated to typical package functionality and suggest covert data exfiltration. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, but the behavior indicates privacy-invasive data transmission. The code operates straightforwardly, but the external communication to untrusted domains is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. It lacks obfuscation but exhibits high privacy invasion and security risk. The behavior aligns with tracking or exfiltration malware, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
