  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to specified URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), current user (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests with collected data to external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> constructs URLs with parameters -> makes HTTP requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple external domains, including suspicious-looking URLs. No explicit hardcoded credentials, but data exfiltration to third-party domains is suspicious. The code gathers environment info and transmits it silently.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs. The URLs appear suspicious and could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. The data flow is straightforward and does not include any obfuscation or malicious payloads such as code execution or data theft beyond system info exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code segments are present. The code's primary concern is its potential to silently transmit system data to external servers, which can be malicious depending on the context.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for data collection and exfiltration to potentially malicious domains. While it does not contain explicit malicious payloads like code injection or backdoors, its behavior suggests tracking or spying, which is suspicious in a package context.",
