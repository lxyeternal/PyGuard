{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple external URLs with a random identifier as part of a tracking or data exfiltration mechanism.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), current user (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Constructed URLs with system data as query parameters, sent via urllib.request.urlopen to external domains.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, directory, random number) is embedded into URLs and sent over the network to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains with obfuscated-looking subdomains; data exfiltration behavior; no clear benign purpose; no user interaction or explicit permission request.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers identifiable system information and transmits it to external servers under the guise of a URL request. The domains used are obscure and appear to be malicious or for tracking. The use of random numbers as identifiers may indicate session tracking or data correlation. The code executes network requests without user consent or transparency. No validation or sanitization occurs for the data, and the purpose appears to be tracking or malicious data collection. No suspicious obfuscation or hidden code execution is detected beyond the network calls and data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior consistent with data exfiltration or tracking, contacting suspicious domains with system data. It is likely malicious or at least highly suspicious for privacy invasion. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be avoided.",
