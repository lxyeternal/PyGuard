  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection.",

  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current path) -> URL encoding -> HTTP GET request to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Sending system details to suspicious, unrelated domains; usage of multiple external URLs with similar structure; no clear legitimate purpose for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information including hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters along with a random number. It iterates over a list of suspicious-looking URLs and makes HTTP GET requests to each, sending system details. The URLs appear to be obfuscated or part of a command-and-control or tracking infrastructure. There are no explicit malicious payloads or code injections, but the behavior indicates data exfiltration or covert tracking. The use of external, untrusted URLs and collection of environment info without user consent suggests malicious intent or privacy violation. No obfuscated code or malware signatures are present, but the purpose of data collection is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to silently send system details to external domains, which is typical of data exfiltration or tracking malware. While not explicitly malicious in terms of code injection or destructive actions, it poses a privacy and security concern due to unknown external communications and data collection without user consent.",
