  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it via HTTP requests to specified external URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), current user (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Uses urllib.request.urlopen to send data to external URLs, potentially exposing sensitive system information to third parties.",
  "flows": "Collects system data -> Encodes parameters -> Sends HTTP GET request to multiple external URLs with collected info embedded in URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Sends system information to suspicious external domains without any user consent or obvious legitimate purpose; the URLs appear malicious or suspicious; use of multiple external domains and data exfiltration-like behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers host, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP requests to third-party domains. The URLs seem suspicious, possibly malicious, and are likely used for tracking, fingerprinting, or exfiltrating system data. The use of obscure domains and data transmission without user knowledge indicates malicious intent. No input validation or user prompts are present. The script's structure is straightforward, but the intent to silently send system data to unknown servers is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be malicious, designed to gather system info and send it to external, suspicious domains possibly for tracking or data theft. It demonstrates potentially malicious behavior with a high security risk. The overall malicious intent score is high.",
