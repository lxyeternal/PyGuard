  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines package metadata (name, version, author, email, description), and calls setup() with this information. All elements are standard for Python package distribution and contain no dynamic or obfuscated code. No input handling, no data processing, and no external connections are made. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
