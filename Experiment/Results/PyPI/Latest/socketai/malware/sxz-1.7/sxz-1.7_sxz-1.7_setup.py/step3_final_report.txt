  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process external data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only from setuptools and calls setup() with hardcoded, static metadata. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code is a typical package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
