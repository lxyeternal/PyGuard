  "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('main()') during installation, which is a significant security concern. While the actual content of 'main()' is unknown, this pattern is inherently risky and could be exploited for malicious activities. Therefore, the pattern warrants a high security risk score and warrants caution. The malware score should be moderate to high depending on trustworthiness, but given the pattern alone, it should be set around 0.5. Overall, this setup pattern is dangerous and should be reviewed thoroughly before use."
