      "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('main()') during installation, which is a significant security concern. While the actual content of 'main()' is unknown, this pattern is inherently risky and could be exploited for malicious activities. Therefore, the pattern warrants a high security risk score and warrants caution. The malware score should be moderate to high depending on trustworthiness, but given the pattern alone, it should be set around 0.5. Overall, this setup pattern is dangerous and should be reviewed thoroughly before use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a passive exfiltration tool that transmits system info to suspicious domains without active malicious payloads. It warrants high security concern due to privacy invasion but should not be classified as active malware. Malware suspicion scores should be moderate (~0.4), while security risk remains high (~0.75). The reports' assessments are generally accurate; minor score adjustments are recommended to reflect passive exfiltration rather than active malware."
