{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data to remote URLs with unique identifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), executing subprocess commands to obtain MAC addresses, and gathering network addresses.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP GET requests to external URLs with encoded system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are gathered, encoded, then transmitted via URL parameters to multiple remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious URLs likely controlled by an attacker, encoding of MAC addresses, and passive HTTP requests without any response handling or validation. The code does not perform any direct malicious actions, but the data exfiltration pattern is suspicious. The URLs seem malicious or maliciously crafted, suggesting possible command-and-control or data collection for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system identifiers such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, which appear to be associated with malicious infrastructure. The URLs include a random number as a parameter, likely to prevent caching and uniquely identify each request. It makes silent HTTP GET requests to these URLs, indicating an attempt to exfiltrate data or check-in with a command-and-control server. The code uses standard libraries without obfuscation, but the external domains and data exfiltration pattern are concerning. No malware or destructive actions are present, but the code’s purpose aligns with reconnaissance or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a data collection and exfiltration tool targeting system info and MAC addresses, sending this data to suspicious external servers. While it does not contain active malicious payloads or destructive actions, the pattern of behavior and suspicious URLs indicate a potentially malicious intent or compromised package used for reconnaissance or covert data exfiltration.",
