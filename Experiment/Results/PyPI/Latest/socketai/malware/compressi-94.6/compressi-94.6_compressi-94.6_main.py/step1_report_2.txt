  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to predefined external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading network interfaces), URL parameters (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with encoded system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered and encoded (MAC addresses), then used to construct URLs which are accessed via HTTP GET requests, transmitting the data to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain patterns, encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, no validation or encryption of data, minimal error handling which silently ignores failures, hardcoded URL domains that seem malicious or suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code collects potentially sensitive system data including MAC addresses, username, hostname, and current directory. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, then sends this information via HTTP GET requests to three external domains with obscure patterns, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The use of multiple URLs and encoding methods suggests an attempt to obscure data collection. There is no explicit malicious behavior such as executing commands, writing to files, or connecting back to a command and control server. However, the code's behavior of transmitting system information to unknown external servers without user consent indicates potentially malicious intent or at least privacy violations. The domains appear suspicious, possibly associated with malicious activities or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and exfiltration to external servers, which is suspicious. Although it does not contain overt malware like executing malicious commands or damaging files, its behavior of silently sending system info to untrusted domains indicates malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The overall security risk is high due to data exfiltration, despite the lack of direct destructive actions.",
