{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function that reads network interface info, and random.randint() for generating a request ID.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sends data over the network to external domains, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered and encoded (source). The encoded MAC addresses and other info are included as URL parameters. Data flows from sources to the URL via URL parameters and then is transmitted over the network (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts suspicious domains with a pattern suggestive of command-and-control or data exfiltration infrastructure. No user consent prompts or encryption of data is used. The URLs and encoded MAC address hint at potential tracking or data collection behavior. The use of multiple URLs indicates possibly multi-host command and control infrastructure. No clear benign purpose for transmitting this info is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers device-specific information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 before sending. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends system info via HTTP GET requests. The URL endpoints are not associated with any benign services and appear to be designed for tracking or exfiltration. The use of random request IDs (rd_num) suggests tracking or correlation of requests. No authentication or encryption is used, which indicates the data is transmitted plainly. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but performs covert data transmission, which could be malicious if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects system information and transmits it to suspicious external domains without user knowledge. This behavior indicates potential data exfiltration or tracking, aligning with malicious activity. While it does not execute harmful system commands, its data collection and transmission pattern pose privacy and security concerns.",
