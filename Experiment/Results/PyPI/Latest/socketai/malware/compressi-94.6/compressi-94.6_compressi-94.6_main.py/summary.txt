  "conclusion": "The code is a passive exfiltration tool that transmits system info to suspicious domains without active malicious payloads. It warrants high security concern due to privacy invasion but should not be classified as active malware. Malware suspicion scores should be moderate (~0.4), while security risk remains high (~0.75). The reports' assessments are generally accurate; minor score adjustments are recommended to reflect passive exfiltration rather than active malware."
