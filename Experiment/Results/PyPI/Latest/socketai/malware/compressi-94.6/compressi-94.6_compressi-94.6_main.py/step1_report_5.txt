{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces, and random.randint() for generating rd_num.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send collected data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, rd_num) is assembled into URL parameters and sent over the network via urlopen() to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and consistent data exfiltration pattern; no explicit user consent handling. No hardcoded credentials or encryption keys found. The URLs are suspicious and potentially malicious. The code does not verify the response or restrict data flow.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to obfuscate their content. It constructs URLs targeting suspicious domains and sends data via HTTP GET requests without encryption or validation. The use of external URLs with unusual domain names suggests potential data exfiltration. The code lacks any user notification or consent mechanism. No malware signature or malicious payloads are directly embedded, but the behavior indicates possible covert data collection and transmission, which aligns with malicious or privacy-invasive activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a system information gatherer and exfiltrator, sending sensitive details to external, suspicious domains. This behavior is indicative of malicious intent, such as data theft or covert surveillance. The use of multiple URLs and encoding further suggests an attempt to evade detection. No other malicious payloads are present, but the activity itself is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
