  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points for the 'opengrep' package.",
  "sources": "Static strings and variables defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or untrusted data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores reflecting no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor discrepancy is a security risk score of 0.1 in one report, which is unjustified given the static, configuration-only nature of the code. The code adheres to standard practices and contains no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor security risk score in one report should be adjusted to 0 for consistency and accuracy.",
