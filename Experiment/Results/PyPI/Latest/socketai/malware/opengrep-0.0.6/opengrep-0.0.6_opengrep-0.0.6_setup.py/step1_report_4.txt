{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for the 'opengrep' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package configuration, and uses functions from 'setuptools' to gather packages and define entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or external data handling occurs; the code only sets static configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "The static variables and function calls set the package configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code constructs are present. Usage of 'setuptools' is standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution occurs. All data are static strings and function calls to well-known packaging modules. The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
