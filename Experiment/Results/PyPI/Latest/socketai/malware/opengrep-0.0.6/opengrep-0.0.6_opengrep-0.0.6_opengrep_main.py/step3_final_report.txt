  "purpose": "Collects system hostname and exfiltrates it to an external server via HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "os.popen('hostname') to retrieve hostname; external URL request with hostname as parameter.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data over network; external server at pipedream.net.",
  "flows": "hostname retrieved from system -> URL constructed with hostname -> HTTP GET request sent to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() for hostname; disabling SSL verification with verify=False; suppressing all warnings globally; no input validation or error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the hostname via a system command and sends it to an external URL over an insecure connection, suppressing warnings. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present, but the behavior suggests potential privacy invasion or data exfiltration. The use of verify=False and suppression of warnings increases security concerns. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0.2-0.4, risk 0.6) are appropriate; minor adjustments recommend malware score around 0.3 and risk at 0.7 for better reflection of suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior related to data exfiltration and insecure network practices but does not contain explicit malware payloads or malicious code. The current scores are justified; a slight increase in malware suspicion and risk scores is recommended to better align with the behavior's potential implications.",
