  "purpose": "Analyze code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on indicators like obfuscation, dynamic execution, suspicious data flows, and external communication.",
  "sources": "Input data reads, environment variables, network communication functions, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system writes, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network transmission or eval/exec functions, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation levels, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), suspicious string patterns, external communication, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation (score 0.8), uses dynamic execution (eval/exec), and shows signs of external communication, leading to a malware suspicion score of 0.6 and security risk of 0.65. These features justify the elevated scores. Other reports show benign patterns with no suspicious features, low risk, and no malware indicators. The scores are consistent with the described features, with Report 3 justifying higher suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic code use. No further code analysis is provided to confirm malicious payloads, so scores remain appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that only Report 3 shows significant suspicion of malicious activity, justified by obfuscation and dynamic execution signs. The other reports are benign. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No adjustments are necessary.",
