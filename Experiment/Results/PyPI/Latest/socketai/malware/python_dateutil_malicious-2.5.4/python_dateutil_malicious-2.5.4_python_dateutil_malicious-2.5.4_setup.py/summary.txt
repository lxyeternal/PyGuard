  "conclusion": "The code is definitively malicious, executing system commands and exfiltrating sensitive data during package import. The behavior aligns with malware, and the scores of 1 for malware and security risk are appropriate. The straightforward nature of the code supports an obfuscation score of 0. Overall, this package represents a high-severity supply chain attack and should be flagged for removal and investigation."
