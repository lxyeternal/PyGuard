{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from system environment: socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends data over the network to an external URL, potentially leading to data leakage or malicious exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data sources (hostname, cwd, username) flow directly into the requests.get() call as URL parameters, resulting in exfiltration during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes performing network activity during package installation without user consent, sending system info to a suspicious URL, and lack of obfuscation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly collects system info and exfiltrates it via a network request during setup, which is highly suspicious. The URL used appears malicious or at least suspicious. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present beyond data exfiltration. The activity occurs covertly during installation, indicating malicious intent. The behavior aligns with supply chain attack tactics or privacy invasion. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.8, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation ~0) are justified given the malicious exfiltration activity. The code does not perform malicious actions like code execution but the exfiltration alone is serious. The high confidence score (~0.9) is appropriate. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior with high security risk, warranting classification as malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, representing a malicious supply chain attack vector. The behavior is straightforward but malicious, with high security implications. The scores in the reports are justified and consistent. The package should be considered malicious and flagged accordingly.",
