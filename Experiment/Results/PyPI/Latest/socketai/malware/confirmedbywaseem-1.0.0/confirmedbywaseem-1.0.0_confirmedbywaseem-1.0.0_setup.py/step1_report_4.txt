{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects environment information and sends it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, current working directory, and username via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "requests.get() sending data to an external domain, potentially leaking environment info.",
  "flows": "Collect hostname, cwd, and username, then transmit via HTTP GET request to a remote server during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs environment data collection and exfiltration within a package setup script, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL used is obfuscated and points to a domain that may be malicious or used for C2 or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools install command to include a step where it gathers system information (hostname, current working directory, and username). It then makes a GET request to an external URL with these details as parameters. This behavior is hidden within the setup process, which is typically used only for package installation. Such behavior can be used for malicious purposes, such as fingerprinting victim environments, data exfiltration, or establishing a command-and-control channel. The URL appears obfuscated, which suggests malicious intent or an attempt to avoid detection. The code does not perform any malicious actions beyond data collection and transmission, but the purpose and context strongly suggest malicious or privacy-invasive intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly collects environment info and transmits it to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious or suspicious behavior. This pattern aligns with malicious supply chain attacks or data exfiltration schemes.",
