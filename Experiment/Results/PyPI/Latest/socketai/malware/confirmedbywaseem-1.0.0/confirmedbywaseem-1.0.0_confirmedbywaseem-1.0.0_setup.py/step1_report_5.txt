  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, socket, getpass, os, and requests; reads system hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get call that sends collected data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Upon installation, collects system info (hostname, cwd, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of sending system info without user consent during package installation; hardcoded external URL; custom install class performing network activity during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during the installation process, gathers system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to a specified external URL using an HTTP GET request. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which is suspicious because it can collect and transmit user data without explicit consent. The external URL appears suspicious and may be used for tracking or malicious purposes. No other malicious code or obfuscation is present; the actions are straightforward but malicious in intent. The code does not perform any harmful operations on the user's system beyond data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation without user consent. It is highly suspicious and should be considered potentially malicious. This code could be used for tracking or more malicious data collection.",
