{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to an external server with collected system information, potentially transmitting untrusted data.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username) is collected and sent via the requests.get() call to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unsolicited network request during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL used for data exfiltration appears malicious or at least suspicious, indicating potential data leakage or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that extends setuptools' install class. During execution, it gathers system details such as hostname, current directory, and username, then immediately sends this data to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. The request URL appears malicious or at least suspicious, suggesting potential data exfiltration or backdoor activity. No other malicious code like code execution, file modification, or backdoor creation is evident. The network activity occurs during installation, which is unusual and indicative of malicious intent or at least malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the external request is a strong indicator of malicious or privacy-invasive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior: it exfiltrates system information to an external server during package installation. This behavior is indicative of potential supply chain attack tactics or privacy invasion, representing a security risk.",
