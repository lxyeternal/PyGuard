{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call with system data sent as parameters",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username) is gathered and sent via HTTP GET request to an external server during installation",
  "anomalies": "Code performs data exfiltration during package installation without any explicit user consent or indication, and the URL used is suspicious and resembles a malicious C2 server or tracker.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and additional modules like requests, socket, getpass, and os. It defines a CustomInstall class that overrides the run method. In this method, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to a remote URL. The URL is obfuscated and appears malicious, designed to collect system info surreptitiously during package install. The request occurs automatically during the install process, which could be used for malicious tracking or exfiltration. No user prompt or warning is provided. The code does not include any explicit malicious commands like system manipulation, file access beyond info gathering, or data theft beyond info exfiltration. However, its intent and behavior are suspicious given the context of a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent, indicating a potential supply chain attack or malicious tracker. The URL used is suspicious, and the data collection is covert.",
