{
  "purpose": "Define a custom setup script that, upon installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "system info variables (hostname, cwd, username) flow from source functions to the requests.get() call, transmitting data to a remote URL",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system information to an external URL during installation without user consent; use of requests in setup.py for data exfiltration is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to perform additional actions after the normal installation process. It gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external server via a GET request. The URL used is a suspicious domain, suggesting potential data exfiltration or malicious behavior. Such behavior is hidden inside the setup process, which is a common tactic for malicious packages to steal information. No other malicious code or backdoors are present, but the act of exfiltrating user data during installation is highly suspicious and could be malicious if used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly transmits system information to an external server during package installation, which is malicious behavior. This could be used for data collection, tracking, or more malicious activities. It raises significant security concerns and should be considered malicious.",
