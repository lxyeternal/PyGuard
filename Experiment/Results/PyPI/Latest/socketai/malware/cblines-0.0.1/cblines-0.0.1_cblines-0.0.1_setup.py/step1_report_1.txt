  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'cblines' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the setup() function parameters and the imported 'setuptools' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data flows into vulnerable operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows from sources to sinks that could indicate malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is standard package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module, a common library for packaging. It calls setup() with static, benign parameters specifying package name, version, author, description, and packages. All values are hardcoded and standard for a setup script. There are no inputs from external sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns detected. The purpose appears to be straightforward package configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
