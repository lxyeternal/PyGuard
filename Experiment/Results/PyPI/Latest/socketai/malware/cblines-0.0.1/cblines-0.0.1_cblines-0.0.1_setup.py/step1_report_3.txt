  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the Python package 'cblines'.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' module and the call to 'setup()' function with static parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used or propagated.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded secrets or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with fixed string parameters for package name, version, author, description, and packages. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs. The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward Python package setup configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The package appears safe based on the provided code.",
