  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools with static parameters.",
  "sources": "No dynamic input, external data sources, or user input; static parameters in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, network operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with fixed, hardcoded arguments. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
