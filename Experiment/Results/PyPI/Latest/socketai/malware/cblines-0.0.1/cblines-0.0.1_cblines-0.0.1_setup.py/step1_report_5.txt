  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup information for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input sources are explicitly read; package metadata is hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata including package name, version, author, description, and package list. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network or file operations. The setup script appears standard and typical for Python package distribution. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for Python package distribution with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
