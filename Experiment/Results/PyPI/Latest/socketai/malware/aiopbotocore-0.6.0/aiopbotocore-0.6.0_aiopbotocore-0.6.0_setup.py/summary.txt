  "conclusion": "The package exhibits privacy-invasive behavior by silently transmitting system information during installation. While it lacks destructive payloads or obfuscation, the exfiltration activity is serious enough to be considered malicious in the context of supply chain security. The activity warrants high malware and security risk scores, reflecting the privacy violation and potential for malicious use."
