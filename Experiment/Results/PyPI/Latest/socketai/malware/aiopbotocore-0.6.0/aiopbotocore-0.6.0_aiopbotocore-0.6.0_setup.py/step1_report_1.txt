{
  "purpose": "To perform a package setup and install process with a post-install action that sends system information to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The 'send' function retrieves system information via 'platform.node()' and 'platform.system()'; the 'requests.get' call sends data to an external URL during post-install.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' request acts as a sink, transmitting system information to an external server, potentially leading to data leakage.",
  "flows": "System info from 'platform.node()' and 'platform.system()' flows into the URL string, which is then used in 'requests.get' to transmit data externally during post-install.",
  "anomalies": "The code embeds a hardcoded URL with a unique identifier that receives system info; it performs network communication during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that defines a custom install command which, upon execution, sends system hostname and OS information to a specific URL via an HTTP GET request. The URL appears to be a webhook or endpoint for data collection. This behavior is executed during the installation process, which is unusual and can be considered malicious because it secretly transmits system information without user consent. No other suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated elements are present. Usage of external dependencies like 'requests' is legitimate but combined with the network call during install raises concerns about privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly transmits system information during package installation by sending data to an external URL, which is indicative of malicious behavior and privacy invasion. It appears designed to collect system data without user knowledge, constituting malicious activity.",
