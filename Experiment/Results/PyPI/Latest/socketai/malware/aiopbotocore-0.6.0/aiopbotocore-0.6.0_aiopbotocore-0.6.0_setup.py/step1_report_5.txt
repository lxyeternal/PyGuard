{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package called 'aiopbotocore' and execute a post-install action that sends system information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using platform.node() and platform.system(). It also makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL via requests.get().",
  "sinks": "The HTTP request to an external URL acts as a sink that transmits system data outside the local environment.",
  "flows": "System info collected (source) flows into an HTTP GET request (sink), triggered during the post-installation process (via run method).",
  "anomalies": "The send() function makes a GET request to a specific URL with system info, which is unusual for a standard setup script. The URL is hardcoded with a webhook domain, which could be used for data exfiltration. No user prompts or data validation is involved. The import of 'platform' as a package in install_requires is unnecessary and suspicious since 'platform' is a standard library module, not an external dependency.",
  "analysis": "The setup script performs typical package installation steps, but the PostInstallCommand class overrides the run method to include a call to send(). The send() function constructs a URL with system information and sends an HTTP GET request to a webhook URL. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system info during installation, which is not typical or transparent behavior for a setup script. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL and system data transmission without user consent or notification constitutes malicious activity. The inclusion of 'platform' in install_requires is unnecessary and may suggest attempts to obscure or mislead. Overall, the code executes a potentially malicious post-install action that leaks system info to an external server.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation via an external webhook URL. The inclusion of an external network call in the post-install process and hardcoded URL indicate malicious intent and potential privacy violation.",
