{
  "purpose": "The code performs a post-installation action that sends system information to a remote URL via an HTTP GET request, likely for data collection or tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "The system info is read from platform.node() and platform.system() during the send() function execution.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call transmits data over the network to an external URL, potentially leading to data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from platform module functions (node and system) into the URL string, then through requests.get() to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Network request during package installation without user notification, use of a hardcoded webhook URL, and unnecessary import of 'platform' in install_requires.",
  "analysis": "The code executes a network request during installation that transmits system hostname and OS type to an external URL, which is unusual and privacy-invasive. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads like backdoors. The activity resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance typical of malicious supply chain behavior. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates potential malicious intent. The import of 'platform' in install_requires is unnecessary and suspicious. The activity does not modify system files or perform destructive actions but raises privacy concerns. The data exfiltration during setup justifies a high malware and security risk score, with malware likely around 0.8 and risk around 0.75.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits privacy-invasive behavior by silently transmitting system information during installation. While it lacks destructive payloads or obfuscation, the exfiltration activity is serious enough to be considered malicious in the context of supply chain security. The activity warrants high malware and security risk scores, reflecting the privacy violation and potential for malicious use.",
