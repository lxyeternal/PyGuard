  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'huggingleg' Python module.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for package name, package list, and version; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Usage of 'distutils' is deprecated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward setup configuration using 'distutils.core'. It defines package name, packages, and version without any external input, dynamic code, or malicious constructs. There are no indications of malware or security risks. The use of 'distutils' instead of 'setuptools' is noted but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python module named 'huggingleg'. No malicious behavior or security issues are detected.",
