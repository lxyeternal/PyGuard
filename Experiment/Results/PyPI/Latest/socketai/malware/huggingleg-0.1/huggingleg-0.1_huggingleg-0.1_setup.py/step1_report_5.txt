  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'huggingleg'.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings for package name, package list, and version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines static package metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools', which is less common but not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script defining package metadata. There are no external inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard package setup script with minimal configuration. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code inclusion are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
