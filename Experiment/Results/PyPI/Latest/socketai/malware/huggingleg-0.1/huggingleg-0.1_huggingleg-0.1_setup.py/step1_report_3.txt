  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'huggingleg'.",
  "sources": "Constants defining package name, list of packages, and version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools', which is less common but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using distutils to define package metadata. No input reading, external data fetching, or malicious code is present. The script merely specifies package name, contained packages, and version. There are no anomalies like obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behavior. The use of 'distutils' is deprecated in favor of 'setuptools', but this alone does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
