  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'huggingleg' to facilitate distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reads package name, package list, and version from the script inputs",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from source to sink beyond standard setup parameters",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' is outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, specifying the package name, included packages, and version. No external data input, environment variables, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of 'distutils.core' is deprecated but not malicious. The code lacks any obfuscated or suspicious constructs, backdoors, or secret communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
