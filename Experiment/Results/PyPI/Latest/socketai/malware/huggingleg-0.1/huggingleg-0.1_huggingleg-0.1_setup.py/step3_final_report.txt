  "purpose": "A minimal setup script configuring a Python package named 'huggingleg' with static parameters.",
  "sources": "Static parameters within the setup() call: package name, list of packages, and version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform actions affecting external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as the code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools', but this is not malicious or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static setup script with no dynamic or malicious components. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not malicious. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate. The minimal security concern is due to deprecated usage, not malicious intent. Confidence in benign nature is high; no anomalies or malicious signals detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The low security risk score due to deprecated usage is justified but does not indicate a security threat. Overall, the package poses no security risk or malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
