{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom installation process that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket, os, and getpass modules during the custom install step.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends collected data to a remote IP address, potentially leaking system information to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system info sources (hostname, cwd, username) and sent via an HTTP GET request to the specified IP address during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits sensitive environment information (hostname, current directory, username) to an untrusted external server without user consent, which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup tools but extends the install command to include network communication that logs system details to a remote server. The IP address used is non-standard and potentially malicious. No other suspicious code or obfuscation is present. The data collection during installation is an anomaly, as it could be used for malicious tracking or information theft. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials but exhibits behavior typical of supply chain attacks involving data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by collecting and transmitting system information during package installation without user consent. This behavior indicates a malicious supply chain attack aimed at information theft or system tracking. The overall security risk is high due to unauthorized data exfiltration.",
