{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation command to send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username using socket, os, and getpass modules.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends data to a remote server, potentially leaking sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "System info gathered from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get() call, which transmits data to an external IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request during installation without user consent or obvious necessity, and uses hardcoded IP address in the request URL, which is suspicious. The comment '# Dependency Confusion POC' suggests awareness of supply chain attack techniques.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard modules to collect system info and sends it to an external IP address during package installation. This behavior is unusual and could be intended for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded IP and network request in setup routines is suspicious and typical of malicious package behavior. No other malicious code, backdoors, or credential theft mechanisms are present, but the data collection behavior is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation, which could be malicious or a supply chain attack vector. While no direct malware is present, the data exfiltration raises security concerns.",
