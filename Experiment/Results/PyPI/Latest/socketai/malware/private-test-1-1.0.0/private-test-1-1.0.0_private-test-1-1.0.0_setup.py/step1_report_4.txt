{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation command to send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends data to an external IP address (http://192.198.82.14:3000/log), which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The source functions collect hostname, current working directory, and username, which are then sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code conducts data exfiltration during package installation without user consent; hardcoded IP address; no validation or encryption of data; uses a setup script to perform network activity, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, when executed, gathers system information and immediately sends it to a specific remote IP address. This behavior occurs during package installation, which is typically not expected to perform network communication. The hardcoded IP and the data sent suggest potential malicious activity aimed at tracking or data theft. No other malicious code or obfuscation is present; the behavior is straightforward but suspicious due to its stealthy nature and data exfiltration intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system info and sending it to a remote server during package installation, indicating possible data exfiltration or surveillance. It could be used for malicious supply chain attacks if distributed through PyPI.",
