{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external IP address 192.198.82.14:3000/log",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) → requests.get() (network request) → external server",
  "anomalies": "Network request during installation without user consent, hardcoded suspicious IP, straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs data exfiltration during setup, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, especially in supply chain contexts. The behavior is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads, but the exfiltration pattern is a common tactic in malicious packages. The hardcoded IP and data collection without user notification heighten concern. The scores assigned in the reports vary, but given the behavior, a higher malware score (around 0.8) and risk score (around 0.9) are justified. The code's intent appears malicious, even if technically not malware in the traditional sense.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. The behavior warrants high suspicion and security concern. The malware score should be adjusted upward to approximately 0.8, and the security risk score to 0.9, to accurately reflect the severity of the activity.",
