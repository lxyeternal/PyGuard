  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom installation process that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()) during installation.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server at 192.198.82.14:3000/log, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "System info is collected during the install.run() method and transmitted over the network to the specified IP address.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a custom installation step to exfiltrate system information without user consent, indicating suspicious behavior. The IP address used for data exfiltration appears malicious or untrusted. No other suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a custom install class that overrides the run() method. During installation, it collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data to a remote IP address via an HTTP request. This behavior resembles a supply chain attack or data exfiltration tactic, common in malicious packages. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or other malicious code found. The IP address and the nature of data transmission are suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is performing data exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious. It appears designed to gather system information without user consent and send it to an external server, representing a security threat.",
