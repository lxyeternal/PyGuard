{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during package installation and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, indicating potential malicious activity or privacy invasion.",
  "sources": "System commands executed via os.popen() and os.system() to gather OS info, hostname, user, IP addresses, and other system details.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing curl to send a JSON payload containing system info to an external URL (Slack webhook).",
  "flows": "Sources (system info commands) feed into the data payload, which is then transmitted via os.system() to the external webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection and exfiltration during installation, use of hardcoded webhook URL, execution of system commands without sanitization, and lack of user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to run system info commands based on platform, then constructs a JSON message with details like hostname, user, IP, OS info, and current directory. It then sends this data via a curl command to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, all during package installation. The commands used are standard but executed insecurely, and the data exfiltration occurs without user awareness. The activity resembles spyware or reconnaissance behavior, with privacy implications. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs covert data collection and transmission, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to covert data exfiltration during installation, hardcoded webhook URL, and insecure command execution. It should be considered malicious or highly privacy-invasive, warranting caution and potential removal from repositories.",
