  "flows": [
    "System info collected via os.popen() -> formatted into JSON payload -> sent via os.system() to Slack webhook"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Usage of os.popen() and os.system() to execute system commands and send data over network without validation",
    "Sending potentially sensitive system information (hostname, username, IP addresses, OS info) to an external Slack webhook",
    "The webhook URL is hardcoded in the script, which is a security concern",
    "No validation or sanitization of collected data before transmission"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs system information collection based on OS type, then constructs a message and sends it via a curl command to a Slack webhook. The data includes hostname, username, public IP, current directory, and OS details. These actions occur during the installation process, which is unusual and suggests potential malicious intent to exfiltrate system info. The direct use of system commands and hardcoded webhook URL indicate suspicious activity. This could be used for reconnaissance or unauthorized data collection. No evidence of data manipulation or malicious payload execution was observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information to an external server during package installation. It appears to function as a reconnaissance or data exfiltration tool. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and system data collection without validation increases suspicion.",
