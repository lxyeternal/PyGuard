  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen('uname -a'), os.popen('ifconfig'), os.popen('curl ifconfig.me'), os.popen('systeminfo'), os.popen('ipconfig'), os.popen('tasklist'), os.popen('whoami'), os.popen('hostname')",
  "sinks": "os.system('curl -X POST ...')",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, user identity, hostname) are collected via os.popen calls, then combined into a payload and sent via an HTTP POST request using os.system",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers detailed system information and sends it over the internet to a Slack webhook without any user consent prompt or obvious legitimate purpose. The use of 'os.system' with formatted data to send sensitive info appears suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command in setuptools, and during installation, it executes multiple system commands to gather OS details, network configuration, and user info. It then constructs a message including system details and posts it directly to a Slack webhook URL using 'os.system'. The data collected includes hostname, username, IP configuration, and other system info, which are transmitted without any indication of user awareness or consent. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or surveillance rather than benign installation activities. The code does not perform any malicious actions like modifying files or executing malware, but it leaks sensitive information externally, which is a security and privacy concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to collect and transmit system information to an external service without user consent, indicating potential malicious behavior and privacy violation. Although it does not contain direct malware, the data exfiltration activity is suspicious and poses a security risk.",
