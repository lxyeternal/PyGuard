  "anomalies": "The code gathers sensitive system information (hostname, username, IP configurations, OS details) and sends it unencrypted to an external URL. The use of os.popen and os.system for data collection and transmission is potentially dangerous and indicative of data exfiltration activity. The code does not verify or sanitize the data before transmission. No user input is directly involved, but the data collection and transmission method resemble behaviors typical of information harvesting malware.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. During installation, it collects detailed system info based on the platform, including OS details, network configurations, and user info. This data is then assembled into a message and sent via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL. The data collection and transmission happen unconditionally during the installation process, which could be malicious if the package is used maliciously. The use of os.popen and os.system for executing system commands and network requests without validation suggests potential exfiltration of sensitive data or malicious information gathering, fitting behaviors of spyware or data theft malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting comprehensive system information and exfiltrating it to an external Slack webhook during package installation. This pattern is characteristic of data theft or covert surveillance malware. The activity appears intentional and not related to legitimate setup processes, indicating malicious intent.",
