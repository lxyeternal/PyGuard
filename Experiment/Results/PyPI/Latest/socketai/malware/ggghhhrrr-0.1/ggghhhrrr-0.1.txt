The package name's unusual nature suggests caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Further review of the 'notify' function's code is necessary to fully assess security risks."

It does not contain malware or obfuscation but could be used for tracking or command-and-control if misused. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low."
