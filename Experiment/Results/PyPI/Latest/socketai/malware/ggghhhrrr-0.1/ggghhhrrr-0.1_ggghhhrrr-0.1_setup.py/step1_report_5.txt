  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for packaging and distribution of the 'ggghhhrrr' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name, version, dependencies, and entry point definition.",
  "sinks": "The entry point specifies a console script that will invoke 'ggghhhrrr.__init__:notify'.",
  "flows": "The package installation can create an executable script 'ggghhhrrr' that calls the 'notify' function in '__init__' of 'ggghhhrrr' module.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'ggghhhrrr' and script name are unusual and nonspecific, but no malicious code or secrets are evident. The code does not include inline code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious URL/network calls.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses standard setuptools functions to define a package with a single console script. The script entry point points to 'notify' in the module 'ggghhhrrr.__init__', which is typical. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The package name and script are unconventional but not malicious. The dependencies and setup configuration are standard.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard for Python package distribution. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code. The unusual naming does not imply malicious intent but could warrant further review of the package contents.",
