      "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, potentially enabling supply chain attacks or malicious payloads. While the code itself is simple and not obfuscated, the behavior warrants caution. The overall malware score should be increased to approximately 0.8, and the security risk score should be around 0.8 as well, indicating a high potential threat. Further investigation into the contents of 'main.py' is recommended before deploying this package."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior targeting suspicious domains, indicative of reconnaissance or privacy-invasive activity. While it lacks malicious payloads, its pattern warrants high security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable; a malware score around 0.6 and a security risk score of approximately 0.75 accurately reflect the behavior. No obfuscation is present beyond base64 encoding. Overall, the script should be flagged for further review due to its exfiltration pattern and suspicious domain usage."
