  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, potentially enabling supply chain attacks or malicious payloads. While the code itself is simple and not obfuscated, the behavior warrants caution. The overall malware score should be increased to approximately 0.8, and the security risk score should be around 0.8 as well, indicating a high potential threat. Further investigation into the contents of 'main.py' is recommended before deploying this package."
