  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs for tracking or data collection.",
  "sources": "Input sources include platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() which reads MAC addresses from system commands, and the list of URLs.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sends data to external servers, potentially leaking sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is collected and encoded, then transmitted via GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains (oast-cn, oast.fun) that resemble malicious or testing domains; MAC addresses are base64-encoded and sent without user consent; no explicit user notification or control. No apparent obfuscation but collection of sensitive info and silent transmission are concerning.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers device-specific info such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses across different OS. The MAC addresses are encoded with base64, then sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs that appear suspicious and potentially malicious. No user interaction or permission checks are present before data transmission. The use of these specific URLs suggests possible tracking or command-and-control behavior. There is no evidence of data validation, encryption beyond base64, or user notification. The code does not perform harmful actions like file manipulation or system compromise but facilitates privacy invasion via data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for covert data collection and exfiltration of system information, which is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the domains involved and lack of user awareness. It likely constitutes malicious behavior aimed at tracking or reconnaissance.",
