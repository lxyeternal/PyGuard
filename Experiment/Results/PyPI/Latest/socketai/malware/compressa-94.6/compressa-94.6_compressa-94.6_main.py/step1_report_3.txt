  "purpose": "The script gathers system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and sends it via HTTP GET requests to external URLs, possibly for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "System information retrieval functions (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses()), random number generation (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs, passing collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, encoded MAC addresses) is collected, combined into URL parameters, and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs contacted are suspicious, non-standard, and resemble malicious or tracking domains. Base64-encoding MAC addresses may be used to obscure data. The code does not verify or sanitize data before transmission. The code suppresses exceptions silently, hiding potential errors. The inclusion of multiple external URLs suggests data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information: hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, possibly to obscure their content. The URLs targeted are suspicious and non-standard, indicating potential malicious intent. Data is transmitted via HTTP GET requests to these URLs with URL-encoded parameters. The silent exception handling prevents detection of network failures or errors. The overall behavior resembles a data collection or exfiltration mechanism potentially used in malicious supply chain attacks or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to gather system details and send them to external, suspicious domains, which could be used for tracking, malicious data exfiltration, or other malicious purposes. While the code does not perform destructive actions, its behavior is potentially malicious due to the suspicious domains and data collection. It should be considered a security risk.",
