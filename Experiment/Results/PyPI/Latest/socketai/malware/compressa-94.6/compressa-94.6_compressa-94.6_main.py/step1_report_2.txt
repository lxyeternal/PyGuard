  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to specified remote URLs via GET requests with encoded MAC address data.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses()), generating random number, encoding MAC addresses, and constructing URLs with parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data over HTTP GET requests to remote servers.",
  "flows": "System info and encoded MAC address are gathered and encoded, then included as URL parameters in HTTP requests sent to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains likely under the same control, encoding MAC addresses and sending them out, use of random numbers in URL, no explicit user consent, no validation or encryption of transmitted data. The URLs appear suspicious and related to known malicious or testing domains. The code does not indicate malicious activity directly, but it collects and transmits sensitive data without clear purpose or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs with these parameters, appending a random number. The URLs are suspicious and potentially malicious domains. Data is sent via GET requests without encryption or user consent. The code does not perform any malicious actions like executing system commands beyond info collection nor does it exfiltrate data directly from files, but the pattern of data collection and transmission to suspicious domains indicates potential privacy invasion or malicious tracking. There is no obfuscation or malicious payload, but the data exfiltration pattern raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and transmits it to suspicious external servers, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. While it does not execute destructive actions or malware directly, its behavior resembles data exfiltration and tracking, warranting caution. It appears intentionally designed to send system identifiers to remote servers, with no clear user consent.",
