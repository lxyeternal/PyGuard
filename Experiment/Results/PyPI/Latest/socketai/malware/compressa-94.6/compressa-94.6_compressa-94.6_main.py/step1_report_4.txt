  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it encoded to external URLs as part of telemetry or potentially malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), network addresses (get_mac_addresses), and encodes data (base64.b64encode).",
  "sinks": "URL requests to external domains with parameters including hostname, username, directory, and encoded MAC addresses.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, MAC addresses) are encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs, potentially exposing sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated URLs, encoding MAC addresses before transmission, and sending data to suspicious, non-standard domains. No explicit user prompts or interactive input, but data collection and external network requests are notable.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system identifiers such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across different OS platforms. It encodes the MAC addresses with base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends GET requests to multiple external domains. The URLs appear suspicious, as they do not match legitimate domains and include non-descriptive subdomains, indicating potential data exfiltration. The use of random numbers in URLs adds to obfuscation. There are no obvious signs of malicious payload execution or backdoors, but the pattern of data collection and transmission is typical for tracking or covert information leaks. The network requests are made without user consent or indication, raising security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script gathers and transmits system and network identifiers to suspicious external servers without user consent, which could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond the suspicious data transmission pattern.",
