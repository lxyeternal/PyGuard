  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to remote URLs with URL-encoded parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) and a random number are gathered and sent via GET requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple external domains with suspicious URL patterns, sending system info without user consent, inclusion of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends GET requests to each URL, potentially leaking sensitive system information to untrusted external servers. The URLs seem malicious, possibly for tracking or exfiltration. The code does not perform any malicious actions like data theft or backdoor access directly, but it covertly transmits system details, which is suspicious. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present. The code's primary concern is privacy violation through secret data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to covertly send system information to external servers, which raises privacy and security concerns. While it does not contain explicit malware like data theft or remote control, it behaves suspiciously by exfiltrating system details without clear user consent. It should be treated as potentially malicious due to its hidden data transmission to suspicious URLs.",
