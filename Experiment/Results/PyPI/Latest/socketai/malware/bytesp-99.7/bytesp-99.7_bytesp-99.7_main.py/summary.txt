  "conclusion": "The code is primarily privacy-invasive, performing covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads but exhibits behaviors that could be used maliciously. The malware score should be increased from low values to approximately 0.7, and the security risk remains high (~0.75). The obfuscation score is correctly 0. No immediate malicious payloads are present, but the behavior warrants caution and further investigation."
