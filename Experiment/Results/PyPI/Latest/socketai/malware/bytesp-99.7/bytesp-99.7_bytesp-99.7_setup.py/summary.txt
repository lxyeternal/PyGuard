  "conclusion": "The main concern is executing main() during installation, which can be exploited maliciously. The code pattern is suspicious and should be reviewed thoroughly. The scores reflect a moderate to high security risk, with a malware score of 0.5 and a security risk of 0.75, consistent with the potential for malicious activity. Further investigation into main.py is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."
