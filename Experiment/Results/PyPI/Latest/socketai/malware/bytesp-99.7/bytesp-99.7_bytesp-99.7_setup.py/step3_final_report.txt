  "purpose": "The code executes a custom install command that calls main() from an external module during setup, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from main import main' and the call to main() in the run() method of the CrazyInstallStrat class.",
  "sinks": "The execution of main() during the install process, which could run arbitrary code with system privileges.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method executes install.run(self), then imports main and calls main(), creating a source-to-sink flow of code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code (main()) during setup without validation or restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, imports and executes main() from an external module. This pattern is suspicious because it allows arbitrary code execution at install time, which can be exploited maliciously. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The risk depends entirely on the content of main(). The scores assigned in reports (malware around 0.5, security risk around 0.75) are appropriate given the potential for malicious payloads. The pattern of executing external code during setup is a common tactic in malicious packages to run backdoors or malicious scripts. Without inspecting main.py, the exact risk cannot be confirmed, but the pattern warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The main concern is executing main() during installation, which can be exploited maliciously. The code pattern is suspicious and should be reviewed thoroughly. The scores reflect a moderate to high security risk, with a malware score of 0.5 and a security risk of 0.75, consistent with the potential for malicious activity. Further investigation into main.py is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
