  "purpose": "Provide a CLI help menu with ASCII art and command descriptions for a Python-based tool related to Mojang interaction.",
  "sources": "argparse library for command-line argument parsing, input from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, no output to external systems, no network activity.",
  "flows": "User invokes the script with command-line arguments, which are parsed and displayed as help information.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The ASCII art and color formatting are purely aesthetic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display ASCII art and command descriptions, and then invokes this function if run as main. It uses argparse to define subcommands and outputs the help menu with colors. No user input is processed beyond argument parsing, and there are no external data or network interactions. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help menu script that only displays ASCII art and command descriptions. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious patterns present.",
