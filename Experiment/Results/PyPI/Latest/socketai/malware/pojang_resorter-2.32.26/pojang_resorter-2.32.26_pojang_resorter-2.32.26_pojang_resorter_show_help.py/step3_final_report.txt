{
  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and command help information for a CLI tool with colored output.",
  "sources": "argparse for command-line arguments, colorama for colored terminal output",
  "sinks": "None; static print statements only",
  "flows": "Input arguments parsed by argparse, then displayed via print with color formatting",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; purely aesthetic display",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, initializes colorama, defines a function to display ASCII art and help info with colored headers, and calls this function in main. It sets up argument parsing with subcommands but does not process them further. The output is static, with no network activity, data leaks, or dynamic code execution. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code's purpose is purely aesthetic CLI help display, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility that displays ASCII art and command descriptions. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external interactions, and no obfuscation. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's functionality. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting a safe, non-malicious script.",
