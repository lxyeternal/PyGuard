{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for a Python-Mojang interaction tool, displaying help information with ASCII art and color formatting.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments processed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "Display output to the terminal via print statements; no external data or network transmission.",
  "flows": "User input is parsed by argparse, then triggers the display of ASCII art, command descriptions, and help information.",
  "anomalies": "Use of colorama for colored terminal output is benign; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code is straightforward and only manages CLI help display.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries (argparse, colorama), initializes colorama, and defines a help display function that prints ASCII art and command help with colors. It registers four subcommands but does not process or execute these commands beyond help display. There are no network operations, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign CLI helper script focused on user guidance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward command-line help display script with colored ASCII art and command descriptions. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are detected. It simply formats and prints help information.",
