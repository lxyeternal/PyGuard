{
  "purpose": "This code provides a CLI tool for interacting with a hypothetical Python-Mojang system, displaying ASCII art, colors, and command help messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "targets": "The code prints ASCII art, help messages, and colored text; no data is sent externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "User inputs command arguments (source) are processed by argparse to display help and ASCII art (sink). There are no external data flows or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code. Usage of colorama is standard for terminal color formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for terminal color output, defines a function to display help with ASCII art and color formatting, and registers several subcommands. It then displays the ASCII art and command options when run directly. No input from untrusted sources, no external communications, and no code injection or malicious logic are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended solely for CLI help and display purposes. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
