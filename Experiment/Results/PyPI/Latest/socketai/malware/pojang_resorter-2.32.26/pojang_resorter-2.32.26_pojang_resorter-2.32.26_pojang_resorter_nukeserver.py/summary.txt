  "conclusion": "The code acts as a loader for an external executable, which could be malicious if tampered with. While the script itself is benign, its behavior introduces a high supply chain security risk. The malware likelihood is low based on the code alone, but the potential impact is high if the external binary is malicious. Proper validation and integrity checks are recommended before execution."
