{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'pojang_resorter', including its dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list, package discovery via 'find_packages()', and entry point definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this setup script; potential issues could arise if dependencies or entry points are malicious.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from package metadata to dependency specifications and entry point definitions, with no dynamic or external data input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The dependencies listed are common Python packages, and the setup structure follows standard conventions without obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard 'setuptools' functions to define package metadata, dependencies, and console scripts. All dependencies are publicly available packages, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data sources are present. The entry point correctly references a main function within the package. The specified Python version range is typical. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious code are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears to be a standard configuration file for a Python package with typical dependencies and entry points. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code.",
