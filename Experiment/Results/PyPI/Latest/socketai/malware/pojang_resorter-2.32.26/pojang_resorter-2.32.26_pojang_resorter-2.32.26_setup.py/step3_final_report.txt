{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package with common dependencies used for GUI automation, image processing, and network operations.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and the setup() function parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code is purely declarative and does not process runtime data",
  "flows": "No data flows; the script only declares package metadata and dependencies without executing malicious logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, listing dependencies that are common in automation and image processing tasks. No code execution, data handling, or network communication logic is present. The dependencies could potentially be misused if malicious versions are introduced, but there is no evidence of malicious activity within this script. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (0), reflecting the benign nature of the code and dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The dependencies are standard and used legitimately. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code is safe for use.",
