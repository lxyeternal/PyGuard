  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The dependencies are common for automation and image processing. The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusions are accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes that the setup script is standard, with no malicious intent. The dependencies and configuration are typical, and no suspicious code is present.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The confidence is high, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** While acknowledging the dependencies are common, this report assigns a security risk of 0.2 and a malware score of 0. Despite dependencies like 'pyautogui', 'pygetwindow', and 'requests' can be used maliciously if misused, their presence alone doesn't indicate malicious activity. The report correctly notes no malicious code is visible.\n- **Potential concern:** The security risk score of 0.2 suggests some caution, but since no actual malicious behavior is detected, this might be slightly overstated.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score remains at 0, which is justified. The security risk score could be lowered to 0, aligning with the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** The report finds no anomalies or malicious code, and the setup script appears standard. The confidence is high, and the malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** No issues here; the assessment is sound.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Recognizes the dependencies are common, and no malicious behavior is evident. It assigns a security risk of 0.2, which may be slightly high given the lack of evidence.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score should remain at 0. The security risk score could be adjusted downward to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code is a standard setup script with no malicious code or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as unobfuscated (0).\n- **Risk Score:** The majority of reports assign a low to moderate risk (0.1-0.2). Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident, a risk score of **0** is more appropriate across the board.\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe setup script is a typical, benign Python package configuration. While dependencies like 'discord.py' and 'pyautogui' can be misused if exploited, their mere presence does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Assign malware score = 0, obfuscated = 0, and risk score = 0.",
