The current scoring in the reports is accurate; malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should be 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 can be lowered to 0 for a more conservative assessment. Overall, the script is safe and suitable for use."

      "conclusion": "The code acts as a loader for an external executable, which could be malicious if tampered with. While the script itself is benign, its behavior introduces a high supply chain security risk. The malware likelihood is low based on the code alone, but the potential impact is high if the external binary is malicious. Proper validation and integrity checks are recommended before execution."

It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no external interactions, and no obfuscation. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's functionality. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting a safe, non-malicious script."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, employing heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution to conceal payloads. The high scores across reports are justified, indicating a significant security threat. It should be treated as high risk until further analysis confirms its intent."

      "conclusion": "The script functions as a controlled command dispatcher with potential external risks. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is external module integrity and input validation. The overall security posture is moderate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score around 0.55 due to external dependencies and destructive commands."
