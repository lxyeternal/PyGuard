{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface to execute predefined scripts or functions based on user input, primarily for server management tasks.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse; command and extra arguments provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing scripts; direct function calls imported from external modules ('pojang_resorter.forceop' and 'pojang_resorter.nukeserver').",
  "flows": "User input -> command map validation -> subprocess execution or direct function invocation -> external modules/functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential lack of input sanitization for 'extra_args'; reliance on external modules which could be malicious; execution of destructive command 'nukeserver'.",
  "analysis": "The code restricts commands via a command map, reducing arbitrary execution. It imports specific functions from local modules and executes scripts via subprocess, passing user-provided arguments directly. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The main risks stem from external modules ('forceop', 'nukeserver') which could be malicious if compromised, and from the execution of scripts or functions with unvalidated arguments. The 'nukeserver' command is destructive and warrants caution. Overall, the code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious payloads, but external dependencies and lack of input validation pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a controlled command dispatcher with potential external risks. It does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The primary concern is external module integrity and input validation. The overall security posture is moderate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score around 0.55 due to external dependencies and destructive commands.",
