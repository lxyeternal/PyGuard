  "purpose": "Obfuscated code intended to decode and execute hidden payloads",
  "sources": "Input data is embedded in a base64-encoded string within the code itself",
  "sinks": "exec() function executes the decoded code, potentially running malicious payloads",
  "flows": "Base64 string is reversed, then decoded, decompressed, and executed via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda for dynamic import and obfuscation; reverse string decoding; layered decoding and decompression",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' for decompression and 'base64' for decoding. It reverses a large base64-encoded string, decodes it, then decompresses it. The result is executed directly with exec(). This pattern indicates intentional obfuscation and the execution of a potentially malicious payload. The use of string reversal and layered decoding is typical of hiding malicious intent. There are no other library calls or data flows aside from the decoding and execution pipeline. The absence of any input sources beyond the embedded string and the use of exec() to run decoded code constitute high risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, employing multiple obfuscation techniques to hide its payload, which is executed directly. Such patterns are commonly associated with malicious code aiming to hide malicious intent and execute arbitrary code. The code's intent appears to be malicious due to obfuscation and direct execution of decoded data.",
