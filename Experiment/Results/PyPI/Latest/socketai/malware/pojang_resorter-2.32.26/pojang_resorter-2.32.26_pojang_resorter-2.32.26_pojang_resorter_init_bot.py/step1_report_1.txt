  "purpose": "Obfuscated script likely intended to execute decompressed and decoded code.",
  "sources": "Input data is from a base64-encoded, reversed string within the lambda function, which is then decompressed.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decompressed code via exec() function.",
  "flows": "Code reverses the string, decodes from base64, decompresses with zlib, then executes the result.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated code using string reversal, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic execution. The inline lambda function and the compressed payload suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that performs multiple layers of decoding and decompression. It reverses a long base64-encoded string, decodes it, decompresses it, and executes the resulting code. This pattern is typical of obfuscated malware designed to hide malicious payloads. The direct use of exec() on dynamically generated code is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior. No other library usage is suspicious; the core concern is the obfuscation and execution flow, which are often used to conceal malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly obfuscated, decompresses and decodes a payload, and executes it dynamically. This behavior strongly suggests malicious intent, such as hiding payloads or backdoors. Due to the obfuscation and dynamic execution, the code poses a significant security risk.",
