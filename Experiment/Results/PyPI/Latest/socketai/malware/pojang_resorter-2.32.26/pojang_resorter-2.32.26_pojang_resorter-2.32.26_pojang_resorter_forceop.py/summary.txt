  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scoring in the reports is accurate; malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should be 0. The slight risk score of 0.1 can be lowered to 0 for a more conservative assessment. Overall, the script is safe and suitable for use."
