  "purpose": "The code assigns operator privileges to a specified username via command-line input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line argument 'username' through argparse.",
  "sinks": "Prints confirmation message to stdout; no data sinks that leak untrusted data or perform unsafe actions.",
  "flows": "Input from command line (username) flows into assign_operator() and is printed out.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscation or hidden behavior. The script's function is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script uses argparse to accept a username and then prints a message confirming privilege assignment. It does not perform any actual privilege changes, network communications, or sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is simple, clear, and designed solely for logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for privilege assignment logging. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
