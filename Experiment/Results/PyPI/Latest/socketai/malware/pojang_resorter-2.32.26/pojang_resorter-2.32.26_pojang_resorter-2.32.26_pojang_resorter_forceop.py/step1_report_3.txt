  "purpose": "The code assigns operator privileges to a specified username.",
  "sources": "Input: command-line argument 'username' provided via argparse.",

  "flows": "Input from command-line argument flows through 'assign_operator' function and is output via 'print'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No use of unsafe code practices.",
  "analysis": "The script parses a username from command-line arguments and prints a confirmation message. There is no code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward, and there are no hidden or obfuscated components. The code does not perform any network activity, file operations, or sensitive data handling beyond the input prompt. Overall, the code appears to serve a simple administrative function without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic script to assign operator privileges by printing a confirmation message. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe with no evident security concerns.",
