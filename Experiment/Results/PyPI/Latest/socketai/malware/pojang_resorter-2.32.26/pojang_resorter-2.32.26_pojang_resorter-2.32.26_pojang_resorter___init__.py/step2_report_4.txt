  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The original code is a minimal module that imports a local 'main' function and defines some metadata variables (__version__, __author__). There are no data flows, no external communication, no user input handling, and no suspicious code.\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no anomalies, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, metadata and import statements only, with no security issues.\n\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since the code is static, with no external communication, no user input, no suspicious patterns, and only local imports and metadata, the risk score should remain at 0.\n\n- No justification exists for a higher risk score.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware scores**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n- No malicious activity is indicated or suggested.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports correctly assume no vulnerabilities based on static analysis.\n\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are unjustified.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure consistency of scores**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The code is a typical package initialization file with no security concerns.\n- The import of 'main' from a local module is standard and does not pose any risk.\n- The hardcoded metadata is common practice and benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores should remain at zero for malware and risk, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
