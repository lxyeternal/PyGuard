  "purpose": "Provides basic metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .main import main' suggests reading the main module of the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here beyond the import of main, which likely contains functional code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are evident. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__ and __author__) and imports the main function from a local module. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The import is a standard practice in Python packages. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and straightforward, serving as part of a CLI package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
