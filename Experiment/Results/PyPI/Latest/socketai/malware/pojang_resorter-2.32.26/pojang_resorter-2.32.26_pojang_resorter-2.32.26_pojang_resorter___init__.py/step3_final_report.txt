{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package initialization module, providing metadata and importing the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (__version__, __author__) and imports a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "The flow involves static import of 'main' and setting metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module defining version and author metadata, importing a local 'main' function, with no data processing, input/output, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, external data flows, or vulnerabilities are evident. The import of 'main' does not imply malicious intent, as its content cannot be assessed here. The code's simplicity and static nature support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
