  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and only includes package metadata and a single import statement. There are no data input, processing, or output operations, nor any external network interactions. The import is local and standard, and version/author info is hardcoded. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to define package metadata and import a local module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
