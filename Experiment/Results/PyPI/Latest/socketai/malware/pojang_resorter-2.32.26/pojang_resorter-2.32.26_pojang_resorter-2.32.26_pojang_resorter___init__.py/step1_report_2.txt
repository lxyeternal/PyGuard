  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "No input reading or data fetching; only module metadata and import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely initializes module attributes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining package metadata (__version__, __author__) and importing the main function from a local module. No user input handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing is present. The import statement is standard for Python packages, and there are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The metadata indicates versioning and author info, which are common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization code with no malicious behavior or security issues. It solely defines metadata and imports the main function. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
