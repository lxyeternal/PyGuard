  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single print statement that outputs 'hello'. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external network calls, and no suspicious or malicious constructs. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or other malicious patterns. It appears to be a benign, trivial program with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and contains no malicious behavior. It performs a simple output operation with no security risks.",
