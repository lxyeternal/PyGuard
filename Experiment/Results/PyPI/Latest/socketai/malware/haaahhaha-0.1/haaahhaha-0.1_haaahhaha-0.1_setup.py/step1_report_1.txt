{
  "purpose": "Custom installation script that downloads and executes an MP3 file from a specified URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables and executes system commands via subprocess, specifically the curl command and PowerShell to download and run a file.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess calls execute external commands that can run downloaded files and potentially malicious content.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a download command with a URL, runs it via PowerShell, checks if the file exists, then executes the downloaded file using PowerShell. The flow from URL to executing the downloaded file is the key source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an MP3 file from a remote URL and automatically executes it without any verification or user consent, which is highly suspicious. The URL appears to point to a media file, but the script treats it as an executable by executing the MP3 file, which may be an attempt to run arbitrary code or cause harm.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon installation, downloads a media file from a Discord CDN link using curl via PowerShell. It then attempts to run this file as a process. The use of a hardcoded URL, combined with automatic execution of the downloaded file, constitutes malicious behavior or at least a significant security risk. The script does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded content. The use of subprocess with PowerShell commands to download and execute code without any checks is indicative of potential malicious intent, possibly designed to persist or run harmful code on the host system.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes a malicious or potentially harmful behavior by downloading an external file and executing it without user consent or validation. It poses a serious security threat if installed, as it could run arbitrary or malicious code on the system.",
