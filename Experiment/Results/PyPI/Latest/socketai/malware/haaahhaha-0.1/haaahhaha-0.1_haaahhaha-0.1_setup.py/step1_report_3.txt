{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an MP3 file from a specified URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the network via a curl command executed in PowerShell to download a file from a remote URL.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is executed directly with PowerShell's Start-Process, which could potentially run malicious code if the file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Source: curl download command -> downloaded file saved as 'b.mp3' -> execution command 'Start-Process' to run 'b.mp3'.",
  "anomalies": "The script downloads an MP3 file and immediately attempts to execute it, which is unusual for a package installation script. The URL points to a media file, yet it's executed as a process, which is suspicious. No validation of the downloaded content. The use of hardcoded URL and the silent download-and-execute pattern are red flags.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to run a custom method. During installation, it constructs a PowerShell command to download an MP3 file from a Discord CDN URL using curl, saving it as 'b.mp3'. If the download is successful, it attempts to run the MP3 file directly via PowerShell's 'Start-Process', which can execute files without validation. The use of media files as executables is highly suspicious. No checksums, validation, or safeguards are present. This behavior could be used to deliver malicious payloads or execute arbitrary code, constituting potential malware. The pattern is consistent with obfuscation or malicious activity to hide payload delivery behind media files.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits suspicious behavior by downloading a media file and executing it directly, which is uncommon and risky in package installation routines. The approach resembles malicious tactics for delivering or executing harmful payloads. Given the direct download and execution without validation, this code likely poses a security threat.",
