  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the Python package 'pykane'.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within the setup() function (name, version, author, description, packages).",
  "sinks": "None; no external input or data flow present.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned directly to setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author name 'saybyetomelolxd' and description 'None' as a string, but these are placeholders and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools. It contains no external input, dynamic code, network operations, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with consistent scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The unusual author name and placeholder description do not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The minor anomalies are placeholders and do not impact security. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
