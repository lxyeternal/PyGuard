{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent or malware delivery.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/Anch.exe' used in curl.exe command; the subprocess call executing the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded executable via PowerShell's Start-Process, which can run untrusted code with system privileges.",
  "flows": "The code reads input from the remote URL (source), saves it to disk, then executes it directly (sink) without validation or checks.",
  "anomalies": "No validation or signature checks on the downloaded file; immediate execution of remote code; use of PowerShell for silent download and execution; no obfuscation or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a straightforward download of an executable from an untrusted source and executes it without validation, signature verification, or sandboxing. This pattern is characteristic of malware droppers or supply chain attacks. The code is clear, not obfuscated, and uses standard PowerShell commands. The lack of validation and immediate execution of remote code pose high security risks. The behavior aligns with known malicious tactics, justifying high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential by downloading and executing an untrusted remote binary without validation. It should be classified with maximum malware and risk scores, as it represents a typical malicious supply chain behavior.",
