  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to untrusted remote download and silent execution without validation. It aligns with typical malware delivery patterns, warranting a malware score close to 1 and a high security risk score. The behavior is consistent with malicious activity, and the lack of validation or user prompts further elevates the threat level."
