{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL and executes it silently on the local machine.",
  "sources": "URL string in the curl.exe command, os.getcwd() for output path",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded executable via PowerShell Start-Process",
  "flows": "curl.exe downloads Anch.exe from URL to local path -> PowerShell runs Anch.exe silently",
  "anomalies": "Download from a suspicious external URL and immediate execution of the downloaded file without validation or sandboxing; no checksums or signatures are verified",
  "analysis": "The script automates downloading a remote executable file from a URL hosted on GitHub and executes it immediately. This pattern is typical of malicious activity aiming to run payloads covertly. The code does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file, and executing an unverified remote executable poses high security risks. The use of PowerShell commands within subprocess calls to both download and run the executable increases the potential for malicious activity. No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or other anomalies are present, but the purpose and behavior strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to automatic downloading and execution of an external executable without validation. It resembles typical dropper behavior used in malware campaigns.",
