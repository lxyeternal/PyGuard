  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the 'tronyx' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and repository URL.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, static metadata definitions in setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external data processing",
  "flows": "Static data from file read into long_description, then into setup() parameters",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic evaluation present",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard 'setup.py' script that imports setuptools and pathlib, reads a local README.md file for the long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata, dependencies, author info, and repository URL. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All operations are static and typical for Python packaging scripts. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
