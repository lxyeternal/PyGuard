  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'tronyx' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is used in a manner that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from source to sink; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activities. The code adheres to standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, reads the README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and repository URL. All operations are standard for a Python package setup. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the code does not perform any runtime data processing or external communications. The only external data read is from a local README.md file, which is safe. No unusual code patterns or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup.py script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
