  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No. The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is low (0.2), which is reasonable given the minimal context. Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all zero, aligning with the assessment. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No. The import is standard, with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The analysis correctly states the benign nature.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is high (1), which is justified. Scores for malware, obfuscated, and risk are all zero, consistent with the findings. No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No. Again, a simple import with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is 0.9, which is appropriate given the thoroughness. Malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all zero or very low, matching the assessment. No changes required.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No. The import appears standard and benign.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, which is justified. All scores align with the benign nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Presence of issues:** No. The import is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Confidence is 0.8, reasonable given the minimal context. Scores for malware, obfuscated, and risk are all zero, consistent with the conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify this as a benign import statement with no malicious activity or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are reasonable and align with the analysis.  \n- **Malware scores:** All zero, correctly reflecting no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, indicating no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk scores:** All very low or zero, appropriate for such simple import statements.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments:** None needed. The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- **My estimate:**  \n  - **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n  - **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal risk, just due to import context, but effectively negligible)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign import statement with no security concerns based on the provided reports.",
