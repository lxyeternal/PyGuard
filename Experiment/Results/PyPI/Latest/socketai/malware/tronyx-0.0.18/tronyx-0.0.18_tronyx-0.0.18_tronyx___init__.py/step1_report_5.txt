  "purpose": "Importing the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports 'perm' from a local module; no external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways visible in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected. The import is relative, which is typical in module packages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement, which suggests modular code organization. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden behaviors. The import does not reveal any credentials, network activity, or code execution beyond loading a module.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard import statement within a package, with no malicious intent or anomalies detected.",
