  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file 'main' during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is from importing 'perm' from 'main' during module load; no further data flow is visible.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only performs a standard import; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single member 'perm' from a local module 'main'. It does not contain any executable logic beyond this import statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. The simplicity indicates a standard import statement typical in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project.",
