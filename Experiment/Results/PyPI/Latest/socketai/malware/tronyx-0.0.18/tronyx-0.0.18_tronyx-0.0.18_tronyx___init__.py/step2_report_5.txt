  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of the conclusions.\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is a straightforward import statement with no additional context. No malicious activity or security concern is evident.\n   - **Scores:** confidence 0.2, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** The low confidence score aligns with the minimal context. No issues found.\n   \n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above, a simple import. No signs of malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — consistent.\n   - **Justification:** High confidence due to the straightforward nature; no issues.\n   \n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement. No suspicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** confidence 0.9, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1 — slightly higher confidence, but still consistent.\n   - **Note:** The securityRisk is 0.1, perhaps indicating minimal concern due to the relative import. This seems reasonable.\n   \n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as previous, no anomalies.\n   - **Scores:** confidence 1, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — appropriate.\n   \n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same minimal import; no malicious signs.\n   - **Scores:** confidence 0.8, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0 — consistent with the assessment.\n   \n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this code snippet is a benign import statement.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as expected.\n- The confidence scores are generally high, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n- The securityRisk scores are very low, which aligns with the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the minimal code provided.\n- No adjustments needed unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal, just due to the nature of relative imports, but overall negligible)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and consistent. Given the code snippet, there is no evidence of security issues or malicious intent.",
