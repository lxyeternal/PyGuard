{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of 'perm' from the local 'main' module, likely for use within a larger package or module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code only imports a module component without executing or processing data.",
  "flows": "The import loads 'perm' from 'main', with no data flow beyond module loading; no external data or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and contains no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import is from a local module, which is common in Python projects. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The absence of suspicious patterns and the straightforward nature of the code suggest it is benign. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0 and high confidence levels. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports reflects minimal caution but is not indicative of actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign relative import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
