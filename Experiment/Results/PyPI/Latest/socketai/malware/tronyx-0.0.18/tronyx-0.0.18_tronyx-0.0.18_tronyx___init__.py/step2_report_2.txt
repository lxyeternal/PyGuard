  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Evidence of Malicious Activity:**\n   - All reports describe a single import statement: `from .main import perm` or similar.\n   - The code is minimal, with no execution, input/output, network activity, or data handling.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The import is from a local module, which is standard practice in Python projects.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence scores are high where the analysis is certain, and slightly lower where some uncertainty exists, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Given the evidence, none of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5.\n   - The highest confidence is 1, with risk scores at 0.1 or 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No report suggests any reason for elevated risk based on the code snippet.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - Since the code is only an import statement with no malicious activity, malware scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - No suspicious behavior or malicious payloads are indicated.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the limited context.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are evident; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - Minor variations in confidence and security risk are acceptable given the subjective assessment nuances.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Overall malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal but non-zero uncertainty about context, but no actual risk)  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- The minimal security risk score reflects the lack of evidence for any threat.  \n- The malware score remains at 0, as there is no indication of malicious intent or payload.  \n- Obfuscation is not present.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is benign, and the current scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
