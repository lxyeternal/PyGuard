  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by transmitting a private key over the network without security measures, indicating potential data exfiltration. While no explicit malware or malicious payloads are present, the pattern is concerning, especially if the remote server is malicious. The scores of malware at 0.5 and security risk at 0.7 are appropriate, reflecting moderate suspicion and high privacy risk."
