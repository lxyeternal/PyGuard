  "purpose": "Send a private key to a remote server and retrieve a switcher value to determine a binary state.",
  "sources": "The 'private_key' parameter passed into the 'perm' function; network requests to external URLs via requests.post and requests.get.",
  "sinks": "Network requests that transmit the private key and receive data; the use of 'requests' library for external communication.",
  "flows": "Input 'private_key' is sent via POST request to an external URL; the response from a GET request is parsed as JSON; decision is made based on the response content.",
  "anomalies": "Potentially unsafe transmission of private keys over HTTP/HTTPS without additional encryption or validation; hardcoded URLs could be suspicious if unknown; the function's intent to send sensitive data externally is a concern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that transmits a private key to an external endpoint and then retrieves a switcher status. The private key is sent in plain JSON, which could be a security risk if the connection is not secure. The code does not perform validation or encryption of the private key before transmission, and the remote server's purpose is unclear, raising potential privacy and security concerns. The switcher URL's purpose is also unclear, but its response influences local control logic. No malicious code such as data theft, system damage, or backdoors is present, but the act of transmitting sensitive data externally warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to transmit sensitive private key data to an external server, which could pose privacy or security risks. No malicious activity is evident, but the external data handling behavior could be malicious if the remote server is untrusted or if data is intercepted. The overall risk is moderate due to potential data exposure.",
