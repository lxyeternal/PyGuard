{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function that prints 'It Works' with no input, external communication, or complex logic.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data leaks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static and self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial function that outputs a static message. All reports confirm its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present, and the code does not perform any risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
