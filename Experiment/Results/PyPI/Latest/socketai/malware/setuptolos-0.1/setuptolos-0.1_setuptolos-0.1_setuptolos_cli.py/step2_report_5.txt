  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and overall security implications.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The original code is a straightforward function:\n```python\ndef cli():\n    print(\"It Works\")\n```\n- All reports describe it as a simple CLI function printing a static message.\n- No external data sources, no input handling, no external communication, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns are mentioned.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate each report's reasoning and scores**\n\n- All reports consistently state the code is benign, simple, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are 1.0 across all reports, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0 or 0.0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- Malware scores are 0, indicating no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Check for any logical flaws or inconsistencies**\n\n- The reports uniformly conclude no security concerns, which is accurate.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No report claims potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher-than-0.5 risk or malware scores**\n\n- Since the code is trivial and does not perform any data processing, external communication, or contain suspicious patterns, raising the risk or malware scores above 0 is unwarranted.\n- The malware score of 0 accurately reflects the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Step 5: Final assessment**\n\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code poses no security risk.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are thorough and correct; no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a trivial, harmless function that prints a static message. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring aligns with the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
