  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a simple print statement: `print(\"It Works\")`.\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, with no input sources, no external dependencies, and no suspicious behavior.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data flows that could be exploited.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, indicating no security risk.\n   - This is justified because the code performs a benign, static output with no data processing, no external communication, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they directly analyze the code's behavior.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is harmless.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- **Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Estimated Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a trivial print statement with no external dependencies, no data flow, and no suspicious behavior. All evidence points to a benign, testing or confirmation script.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are appropriate and should remain as-is. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
