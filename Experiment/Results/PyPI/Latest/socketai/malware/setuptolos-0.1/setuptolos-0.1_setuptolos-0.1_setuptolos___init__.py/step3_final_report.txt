  "purpose": "A simple print statement used to confirm code execution.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static code with no data reading or external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data beyond the print statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static output with no data input or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial print statement with no input, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with full confidence, no obfuscation, no malware, and no security risks. The scores assigned are consistent with the code's behavior. No suspicious or malicious activity is present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
