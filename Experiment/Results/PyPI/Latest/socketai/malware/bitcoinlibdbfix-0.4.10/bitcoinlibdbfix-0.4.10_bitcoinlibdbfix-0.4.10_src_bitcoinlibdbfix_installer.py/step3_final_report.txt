  "purpose": "Manage 'clw' command and backup database files in user directory.",
  "sources": "Checks for 'clw' command via 'which', reads database files from '~/.bitcoinlib/database'.",
  "sinks": "Deletes files, creates symlinks to sys.executable, reads database files.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'clw' command -> removes or creates symlink -> backs up database files.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling masks errors; creates symlink to sys.executable; no validation of command outputs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: locating and removing existing commands, creating symlinks, backing up database files. No network activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. Broad exception handling could hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. Symlink creation to sys.executable is common in installers but could be misused if environment is compromised. No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup/maintenance routine with no malicious activity detected. The scores of malware 0 and obfuscated 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.2-0.3) reflects minor concerns about environment manipulation and broad exception handling but does not indicate malicious intent.",
