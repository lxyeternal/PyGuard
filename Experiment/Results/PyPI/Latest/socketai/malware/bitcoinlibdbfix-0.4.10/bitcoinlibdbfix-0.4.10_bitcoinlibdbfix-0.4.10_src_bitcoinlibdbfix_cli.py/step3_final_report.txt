{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for managing a Bitcoin wallet, including importing transactions, private keys, creating wallets, and handling database files.",
  "sources": "Arguments for file paths, passwords, passphrases, and private keys; data read from command-line inputs and files.",
  "sinks": "send_to_all method, which transmits data (file paths, text, sensitive info) potentially over the network or to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input arguments (file paths, passwords, private keys) are checked heuristically; if deemed files, their paths are sent; otherwise, their content or labels are sent via send_to_all.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic, unencrypted transmission of sensitive data (passwords, private keys, database files) without user confirmation or encryption; silent exception handling masking potential issues.",
  "analysis": "The code parses CLI arguments related to wallet and transaction management. It heuristically detects if arguments are file paths and sends either the file path or the content/label to send_to_all. Sensitive data such as passwords, passphrases, and private keys are transmitted without encryption or explicit user consent, posing significant privacy risks. Exception handling is broad and silent, which could mask malicious activity or bugs. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The primary concern is the insecure handling of sensitive data, which could lead to data leaks or privacy violations. The code's behavior aligns with high privacy and security risks but does not exhibit malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious nor obfuscated but exhibits high security and privacy risks due to the automatic, unencrypted transmission of sensitive user data. The scores should reflect no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a high security risk (~0.75) because of data handling practices.",
