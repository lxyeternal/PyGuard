{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package, setting exports and attempting to run pre-install checks if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements: .cli, .version, and optionally .installer",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or network operations observed",
  "flows": "Importing modules, then conditionally executing run_pre_install if available",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of run_pre_install suggest a setup or pre-install process; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and performs an optional pre-install step by importing run_pre_install from a local installer module. The try-except block ensures that failure to import or run this function does not disrupt normal operation. No signs of malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward, with standard package initialization logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard package bootstrap code with a pre-install hook. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
