  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, representing typical package setup logic. The execution of run_pre_install() during import is a potential vector if the function is malicious, but no evidence supports this. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's apparent safety. Caution should be exercised if run_pre_install() is from an untrusted source, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe."
