  "purpose": "This code appears to set up module exports and optionally runs a pre-install check during import.",
  "sources": "Import statements for main, __version__, and run_pre_install",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_pre_install() if available, which may perform checks or setup tasks",
  "flows": "Import triggers the attempt to run run_pre_install(), which may execute code during module import",
  "anomalies": "Running run_pre_install() during import can be suspicious if it performs disruptive or malicious actions; however, this is a common pattern for pre-install scripts",
  "analysis": "The code imports core functions and version info, then attempts to run a pre-install hook if available. The try-except block prevents errors if the installer module is absent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The only notable behavior is executing run_pre_install() during import, which should be scrutinized for side effects. Without knowing what run_pre_install() does, it is not possible to definitively assess malicious intent, but the pattern itself is typical for setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain explicit malicious behavior; it performs standard setup tasks with a potentially executable pre-install hook. The actual risk depends on the implementation of run_pre_install(), which is not provided here. Overall, low likelihood of malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
