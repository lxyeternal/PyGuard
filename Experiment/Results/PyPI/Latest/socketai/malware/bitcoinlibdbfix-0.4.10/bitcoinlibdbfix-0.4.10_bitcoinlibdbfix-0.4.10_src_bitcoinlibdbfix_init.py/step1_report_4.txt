  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install() during import, which may run arbitrary code if present in the installer module",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions and version info from local modules and defines __all__ for module exports. The notable behavior is the try-except block that attempts to import run_pre_install() from an installer module and execute it immediately if available. This could trigger pre-install checks or setup routines during module import. Since run_pre_install() is conditionally executed only during import, its purpose is likely for setup rather than malicious activity. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present. The execution of run_pre_install() is a common pattern for setup routines, though its specific content is unknown. Overall, the code appears standard for package setup routines, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a package that performs pre-install checks during import. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues based on this fragment alone. The only noteworthy aspect is the conditional execution of run_pre_install(), which is typical in setup scripts and not inherently malicious.",
