  "anomalies": "Execution of run_pre_install() during import without validation; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and sets __all__ for module exports. It attempts to import run_pre_install from the installer module and executes it if present, within a try-except block to avoid errors if absent. No network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The main security concern is executing run_pre_install() during import, which could run malicious code if the function is compromised. However, without the implementation details, this risk cannot be confirmed. The code appears standard for setup routines, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with this analysis, reflecting a low but noteworthy risk due to executing code during import.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, representing typical package setup logic. The execution of run_pre_install() during import is a potential vector if the function is malicious, but no evidence supports this. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's apparent safety. Caution should be exercised if run_pre_install() is from an untrusted source, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
