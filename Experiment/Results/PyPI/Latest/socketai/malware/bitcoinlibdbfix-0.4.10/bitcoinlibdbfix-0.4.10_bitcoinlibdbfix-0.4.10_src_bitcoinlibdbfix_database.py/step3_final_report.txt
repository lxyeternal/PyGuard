{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information, read files from specified directories, encode them, and transmit the data to external services such as Telegram, Discord, and a custom API endpoint. It facilitates data exfiltration and remote monitoring.",
  "sources": "Requests to external APIs (IP geolocation), reading files from filesystem, environment variables (hardcoded tokens and URLs), and user-specified directories.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Telegram, Discord, and custom API endpoints; file reads from disk; data encoding and transmission functions.",
  "flows": "Sources include external API calls and file reads; data flows through encoding and packaging functions; sinks are network requests to external services with data from sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded API tokens, webhook URLs, and static hashes; no input validation or encryption; straightforward code with no obfuscation; potential for covert data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code reads system info and files, encodes data, and sends it to external services using hardcoded credentials. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present, but the embedded secrets and data exfiltration functions pose significant security risks. The code's design enables covert data theft, which is consistent with malicious intent. No anomalies in code structure or logic errors are detected beyond the security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, security risk ~0.8, obfuscation 0) are justified based on capabilities and vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not obfuscated but contains embedded credentials and functions that facilitate covert data exfiltration. While no active malicious payloads are present, its capabilities and security flaws suggest high potential for malicious misuse. The overall malware score is approximately 0.75, and the security risk score is around 0.8, reflecting significant security concerns.",
