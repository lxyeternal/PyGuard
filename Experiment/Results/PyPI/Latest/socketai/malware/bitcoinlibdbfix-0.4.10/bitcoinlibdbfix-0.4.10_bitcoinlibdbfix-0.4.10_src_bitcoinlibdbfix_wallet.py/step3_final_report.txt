{
  "purpose": "Manage Bitcoin wallets, generate keys, import transactions, and send transactions using the bitcoinlib library.",
  "sources": "User inputs for wallet name, network, passphrase, transaction files, and transaction details; data read from transaction JSON files.",
  "sinks": "Printing of passphrases, private keys, transaction hashes, and status messages; potential exposure of sensitive data in logs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → wallet creation/import functions → sensitive data generation → plaintext output; transaction data read from files → transaction import and send functions → network broadcast if push enabled.",
  "anomalies": "Sensitive data such as passphrases, WIFs, and public keys are printed directly in plaintext, which is insecure but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet management operations using well-known libraries. It generates and prints sensitive data like passphrases and private keys without encryption or secure handling, which poses security risks but no malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code relies on user inputs and external libraries in a straightforward manner. The main concern is the insecure exposure of secrets via print statements, which could lead to data leaks if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious payloads or behaviors. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. The security risk score is approximately 0.3, reflecting the security concern of plaintext secret exposure but not active malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate wallet management software with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the insecure handling of sensitive data through plaintext printing, which should be addressed in production but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk with a moderate security concern due to secret exposure.",
