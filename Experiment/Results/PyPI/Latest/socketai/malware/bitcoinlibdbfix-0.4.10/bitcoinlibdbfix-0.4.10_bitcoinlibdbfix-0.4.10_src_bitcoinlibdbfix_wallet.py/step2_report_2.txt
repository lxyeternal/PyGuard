  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior detected; standard wallet operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Comments:** The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious external calls or obfuscation. Sensitive data like passphrases are generated via Mnemonic, which is standard. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. The low malware and risk scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard wallet management, sensitive data handled straightforwardly.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** No malicious code, no suspicious network activity. Sensitive data is printed, which is typical but not ideal security-wise.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard wallet functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** No suspicious network activity or backdoors. The code relies on user inputs and standard libraries.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard functions but notes that sensitive data (passphrases, private keys) are printed, which could be a security concern.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 (higher due to handling sensitive data insecurely)\n- **Comments:** The code's core functions are legitimate, but printing sensitive info in plaintext is a security risk, though not malicious.\n\n**Assessment:** The higher security risk score is justified due to poor handling of secrets, but malware remains zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; no malicious intent, standard wallet operations, sensitive data printed.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** No malicious behavior, but again, sensitive data exposure is a concern.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The functions are standard and rely on well-known libraries.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, which is accurate given the code's clarity.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Generally low (0.2), with one report raising it to 0.4 due to insecure handling of secrets.\n\n### **Critical Observations:**\n\n- The code **does not** perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- It **handles sensitive data** (passphrases, private keys) insecurely by printing them, which is a security concern but not malware.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious code injection.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly increased to **0.3** due to insecure handling of secrets (printing passphrases and private keys). This is a security best practice concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is clear, no obfuscation present.                       |\n| Security Risk    | 0.3               | Handling sensitive data insecurely by printing, but no malicious activity. |\n\n**Final note:** The code appears legitimate, with no malware or malicious intent. The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets, which should be addressed in production environments but does not constitute malware or a high security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate a detailed report summary based on these findings?**",
