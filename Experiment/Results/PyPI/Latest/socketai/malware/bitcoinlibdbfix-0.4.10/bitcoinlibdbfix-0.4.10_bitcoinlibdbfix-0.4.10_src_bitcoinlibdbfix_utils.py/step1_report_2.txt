  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or network communication, but without seeing the actual content, the purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions, environment variables, reading from files, or network data sources if present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writes, system commands, or data exfiltration points if present.",
  "flows": "Data flow would typically be from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs), possibly involving transformations or processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are identifiable without specific code snippets; look for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "Since the provided code is missing, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be conducted. Normally, I would identify sources such as input functions or data reads, then trace data to sinks like network calls or file writes. I would check for suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. Without the code, I cannot confirm malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information provided to conduct a thorough review. No clear malicious behavior or security risks can be identified without analyzing specific code content.",
