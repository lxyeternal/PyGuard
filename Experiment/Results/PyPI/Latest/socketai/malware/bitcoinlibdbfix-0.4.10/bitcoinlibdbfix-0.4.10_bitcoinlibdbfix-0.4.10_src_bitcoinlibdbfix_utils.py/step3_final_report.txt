  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, logs, or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks, such as untrusted input leading to network communication or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is minimal or absent, and no suspicious patterns or dangerous system calls are present. The confidence level is high (0.9), with malware score at 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk is very low (0.1), consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indicators of malware or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
