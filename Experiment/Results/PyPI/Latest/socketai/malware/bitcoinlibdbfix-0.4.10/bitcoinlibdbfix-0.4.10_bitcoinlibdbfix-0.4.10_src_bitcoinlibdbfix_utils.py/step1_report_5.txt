  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific comments or documentation, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and potentially from the file system or network if there are file or socket operations (though not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Data is written to the console (print statements), file system, or network sockets. Specific untrusted sinks are not clearly identified without more code context.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or inputs flows into processing functions, which may then output to logs, files, or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are immediately evident. The code does not perform any malicious network connections or system modifications. There are no obfuscated elements or misleading variables visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard Python syntax. It reads some environment variables and processes data in functions. No unusual language features, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The absence of network activity, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation mechanisms suggests a benign intent. The structure and formatting are normal for typical Python scripts. Without additional context or external dependencies, there are no apparent security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected. The security risk is minimal, and there is no indication of malware.",
