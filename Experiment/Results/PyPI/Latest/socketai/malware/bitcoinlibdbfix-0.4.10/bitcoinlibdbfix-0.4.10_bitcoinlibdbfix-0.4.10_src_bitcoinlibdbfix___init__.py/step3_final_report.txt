  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "eval/exec usage, hardcoded credentials/URLs, environment variables, data input points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, eval/exec execution, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment, user input) to eval/exec or network sinks, potentially via obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, high obfuscation scores, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code features eval/exec with untrusted data, obfuscation, and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. Reports 1-4 show no suspicious activity, with scores reflecting benign code. Report 5 exhibits multiple red flags, including dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and suspicious data flows, justifying high malware and risk scores. The scores across reports are consistent with their descriptions, but given eval/exec and hardcoded secrets in Report 2, the malware score should be increased from 0 to approximately 0.65 to better reflect potential risk. Overall, the assessments are aligned with the evidence, and the scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low risk; however, Reports 2 and 5 contain features indicative of potential malicious behavior, warranting higher malware and obfuscation scores. The overall security posture is moderate, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and further analysis of suspicious patterns.",
