  "sources": "Potential sources include environment variables, input functions, external file reads, or network requests (if present in the code). Since no code is provided, specific sources cannot be identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network transmissions, file writes, or database queries. No specific sinks can be identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks is not identifiable without the code snippet; generally, this involves untrusted data moving through functions to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified due to the absence of code. If code were provided, look for obfuscated patterns, unusual dynamic execution, or hidden code segments.",
