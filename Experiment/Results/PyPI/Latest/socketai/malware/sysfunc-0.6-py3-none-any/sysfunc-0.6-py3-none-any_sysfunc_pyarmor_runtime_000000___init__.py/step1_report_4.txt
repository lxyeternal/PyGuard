{
  "purpose": "Import runtime components from the pyarmor package, likely for code obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leaks detected",
  "flows": "Import statement imports functions/classes for runtime execution, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates trial version and a date, which might suggest license enforcement but not malicious intent; no unusual or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named __pyarmor__ from a local package. The comment references Pyarmor 9.0.6 with a trial license, indicating obfuscation or licensing features. There are no code paths, user inputs, or data processing, and no suspicious behavior such as network activity, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears to be a standard component of an obfuscated or protected Python package, with no malicious activity present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement associated with the Pyarmor obfuscation tool, used for licensing or runtime protection. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
