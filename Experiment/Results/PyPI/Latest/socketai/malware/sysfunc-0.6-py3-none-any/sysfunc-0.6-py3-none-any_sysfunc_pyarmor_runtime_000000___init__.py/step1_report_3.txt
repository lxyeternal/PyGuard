{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely related to code protection or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from a local or third-party module.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates this is part of a Pyarmor trial version, which is used for code obfuscation and licensing. No malicious activity detected in the import statement itself.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a comment and a single import statement. The comment suggests this is a trial version of Pyarmor, a legitimate code obfuscation tool. The import imports __pyarmor__ from the pyarmor_runtime module, which is common in obfuscated Python code protected by Pyarmor. There are no suspicious functions, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is minimal and appears benign, likely part of a protected script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal import statement associated with Pyarmor protection, with no signs of malicious behavior. The presence of the trial comment indicates legitimate obfuscation tooling, not malware.",
