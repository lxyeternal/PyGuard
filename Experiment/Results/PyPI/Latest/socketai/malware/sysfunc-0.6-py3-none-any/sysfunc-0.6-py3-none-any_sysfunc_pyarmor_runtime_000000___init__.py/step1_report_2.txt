{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the use of Pyarmor trial version with a date, which is typical for obfuscation tools but may suggest code protection measures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a relative module named pyarmor_runtime. The comment references Pyarmor version 9.0.6 with a trial license, which suggests that this code is likely obfuscated or protected by Pyarmor. There are no active data flows, user input handling, or suspicious behaviors present. The presence of a runtime import is standard in protected scripts to enable de-obfuscation or licensing checks. No malicious code or backdoors are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement used for code obfuscation or licensing, with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a protected script using Pyarmor.",
