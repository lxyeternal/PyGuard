{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ module from the pyarmor_runtime package, likely related to code obfuscation or runtime protection.",
  "sources": "The code imports __pyarmor__ from the local module pyarmor_runtime.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are evident.",
  "flows": "The code does not process or transfer any data; it merely performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates a trial version of Pyarmor with an expiration date, but this alone is not suspicious. The import statement is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single module __pyarmor__ from the package pyarmor_runtime. The comment references Pyarmor 9.0.6 trial, which suggests this code is part of an obfuscated or protected runtime environment. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import is typical for scripts that rely on obfuscation or licensing protection mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard runtime import associated with obfuscation or license management; it does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
