  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a straightforward import of `__pyarmor__` from a local `pyarmor_runtime` module.\n- Comments indicate the use of Pyarmor trial versions, which is common in obfuscated or protected code.\n- No evidence of data flows, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors is present.\n- The code is minimal and typical for obfuscated or license-protected scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The import statements are syntactically correct and match the original code.\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious activities are present in the code snippets.\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk scores:** Low, reflecting the benign intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n\n**1. Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- **Malware scores (0):** Correct, no malware is evident.\n- **Obfuscated scores (~0.1-0.2):** Slightly higher than zero, but justified given the presence of obfuscation tools (Pyarmor) and licensing comments.\n- **Security risk (~0.1-0.2):** Slightly elevated but acceptable; the code is minimal and doesn't pose risks.\n\n**2. Any logical flaws or assumptions?**  \n- The reports assume that the presence of Pyarmor and trial comments is benign, which is generally correct.  \n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made beyond the benign interpretation.\n\n**3. Are the scores consistent?**  \n- Yes, all reports are consistent in their low scores for malware and risk, given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as part of a protected environment, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.1-0.2 (consistent with obfuscation tools in use)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minimal risk, primarily licensing/obfuscation-related)\n\n**In conclusion,** this code is benign, likely part of an obfuscated or protected script using Pyarmor. The scores are justified and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard import statement associated with Pyarmor licensing/protection.\n- No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- Scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n- **Risk:** 0.2",
