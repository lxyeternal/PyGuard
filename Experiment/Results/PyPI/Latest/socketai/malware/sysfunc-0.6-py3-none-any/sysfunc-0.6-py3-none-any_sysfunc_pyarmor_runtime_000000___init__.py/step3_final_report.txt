{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime component, likely for license or obfuscation purposes in a protected script.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a module from a relative path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports a runtime component; no data flows or malicious control flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comments indicating a Pyarmor trial version and timestamp; minimal code structure; no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement associated with Pyarmor licensing or obfuscation. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The comments suggest licensing enforcement, which is typical for protected scripts. The malware score is 0, as there are no signs of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is low (~0.2), consistent with the use of obfuscation tools. The security risk score is also low (~0.2), reflecting minimal risk. The code's simplicity and context indicate it is benign and standard for protected environments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as part of an obfuscated or licensed script using Pyarmor. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
