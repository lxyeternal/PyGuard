  "purpose": "Import runtime components for the Pyarmor protection system.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is a straightforward import",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating a trial version and a timestamp, which may suggest licensing or version control information, but no malicious behavior or obfuscation evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single module (__pyarmor__) from a relative package, likely used for runtime protection or obfuscation. The comment indicates a trial version of Pyarmor with a date, but no other suspicious or malicious indicators such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions. The structure and content are standard for such licensing or protection modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement related to Pyarmor's runtime. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
