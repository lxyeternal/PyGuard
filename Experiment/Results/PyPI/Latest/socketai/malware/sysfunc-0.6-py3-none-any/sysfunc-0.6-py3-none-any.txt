      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Pyarmor license/protection mechanism with no explicit malicious activity. The embedded binary data and obfuscation are typical but warrant caution. Static analysis alone cannot confirm safety; dynamic analysis is advised if source trustworthiness is uncertain. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a slight adjustment to malware score for the code with opaque payloads. Overall, the risk is low, and the code is likely legitimate protection code, but vigilance is recommended due to obfuscation and encrypted data."
