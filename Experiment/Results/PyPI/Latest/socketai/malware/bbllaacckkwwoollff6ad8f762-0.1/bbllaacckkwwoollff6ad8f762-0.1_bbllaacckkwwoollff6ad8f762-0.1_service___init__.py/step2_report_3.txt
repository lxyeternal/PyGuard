  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n1. Confirm if issues are present:\n- All reports describe the code as a single print statement outputting a static message.\n- There are no input sources, data flows, or external interactions.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are mentioned.\n- The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical errors or misleading claims are evident.\n- The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- The code is purely informational, with no security implications.\n\n5. Malware score considerations:\n- No malicious activity is described or implied.\n- The code does not perform any network, file, or data manipulation.\n- Malware score should stay at 0.\n\n6. Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n- No suspicious behavior is implied.\n\n7. Score consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a trivial print statement with no input, output, or malicious intent.\n- All reports correctly identify it as benign.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThis code poses no security concern.",
