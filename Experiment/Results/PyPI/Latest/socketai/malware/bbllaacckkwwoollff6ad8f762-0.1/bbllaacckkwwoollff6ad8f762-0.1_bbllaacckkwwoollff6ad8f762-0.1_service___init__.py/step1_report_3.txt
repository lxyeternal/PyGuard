  "purpose": "Initialization message indicating that a service module has been loaded or started.",
  "sources": "None, as the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None, no untrusted data is being output or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow present, only a simple print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with a single print statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement that outputs a message indicating the service module has been initialized. There are no sources of untrusted input, no sinks that could leak data, and no complex logic or suspicious behavior. The code does not perform any network activity, data manipulation, or contain hidden payloads. It appears to be a benign initialization message.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign with no malicious intent. It is a simple initialization message with no security risks.",
