  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to execute a command and send its output to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system command output via subprocess.check_output, and network request to remote server via http.client.HTTPConnection.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request sending encoded data to a remote server.",
  "flows": "exec_command() captures output from 'id' command, encodes it, then send_put_request() transmits data over network.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically executes system command ('id') during installation, sends data to external server without user consent, hardcoded server URL, no authentication, replaces '=' characters in base64 output, which may affect data integrity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during package installation, executes the 'id' system command to obtain user identity information. This output is base64-encoded with padding characters removed and then sent via an HTTP PUT request to a hardcoded remote server address. The network request occurs automatically without user interaction, potentially leaking system info. The hardcoded server URL and lack of encryption or authentication indicate malicious intent to exfiltrate data. The encoding modification ('replace' removing '=') could cause decoding issues but appears intended to obfuscate the data. The code does not perform any harmful system modifications but secretly transmits data, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects system information and exfiltrates it to a remote server during installation, indicating malicious intent. It performs unauthorized data leakage without user awareness, representing a security risk.",
