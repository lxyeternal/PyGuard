  "purpose": "During package installation, execute 'id' command, encode output, and exfiltrate data to a hardcoded server.",
  "sources": "Execution of subprocess.check_output(['id']) during install; reading system info.",
  "sinks": "send_put_request() transmitting encoded data via HTTP PUT to external server.",
  "flows": "exec_command() calls subprocess, encodes output, then send_put_request() transmits data to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of system command during install; automatic data exfiltration without user consent; hardcoded server URL; removal of '=' padding in base64 encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code runs 'id' during installation, encodes its output, and sends it to a remote server silently. No authentication or encryption is used. The behavior indicates covert data exfiltration, which is suspicious. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. The network request is performed automatically, and the server URL is hardcoded. These signals suggest malicious intent, specifically privacy violation and potential backdoor activity. The code does not contain destructive payloads but performs unauthorized data collection. The behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration rather than benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during installation, indicating malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, security risk ~0.8, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this behavior. The package should be flagged for review, and its behavior warrants high concern due to privacy violation and unauthorized data transfer.",
