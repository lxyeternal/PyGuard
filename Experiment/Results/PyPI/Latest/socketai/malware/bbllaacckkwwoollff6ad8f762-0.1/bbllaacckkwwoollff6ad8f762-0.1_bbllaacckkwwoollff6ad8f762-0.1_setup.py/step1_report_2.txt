{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that executes a command and sends the output to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.check_output(['id']) reads the output of the 'id' command, and the send_put_request() sends data to an external server.",
  "sinks": "The HTTPConnection request sends data over the network to a specific URL, potentially exfiltrating data.",
  "flows": "exec_command() calls subprocess to execute 'id', encodes its output, and passes it to send_put_request() which transmits data over HTTP to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes system command 'id' during installation and automatically sends its output remotely without user consent. The server URL is hardcoded. The purpose appears to be data exfiltration. The base64 encoding removes padding, possibly to obfuscate data.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom installation class that, upon running, executes the 'id' command to obtain system user info, encodes this info, and sends it via an HTTP PUT request to a specific remote server. The hardcoded server address and automatic data transmission during installation are suspicious behaviors. The command execution and network request happen without user interaction, indicating possible malicious intent such as data exfiltration or backdoor behavior. There is no obvious malicious code like malware payloads, but the behavior strongly resembles covert data collection. No other suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs potentially malicious behavior by executing a system command and transmitting its output to a remote server during installation, indicating a probable backdoor or data exfiltration mechanism. The design is suspicious and should be reviewed further before use.",
