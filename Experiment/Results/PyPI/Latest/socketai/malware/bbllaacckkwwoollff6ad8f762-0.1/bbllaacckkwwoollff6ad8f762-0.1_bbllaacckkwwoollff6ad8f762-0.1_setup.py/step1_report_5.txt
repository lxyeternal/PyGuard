  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process to execute a command and send its output to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading command output via subprocess.check_output(['id']), and network request to remote server.",
  "sinks": "Sending encoded command output via HTTP PUT request to an external server.",
  "flows": "exec_command() executes 'id' command -> encodes output -> send_put_request() sends data over network.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes executing system command during package installation and exfiltrating data to a remote server without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the setup process, executing the 'id' command during installation and transmitting the result to a specified external URL. The data is base64-encoded and sent via an HTTP PUT request. The code does not sanitize or restrict the data or target URL, which is suspicious. The network request is hardcoded to a specific server, indicating potential data exfiltration. The installation process is hijacked to run arbitrary code (system command) and transmit data, which are common malicious behaviors. No obfuscated code or malicious backdoors are present, but the behavior is covert and potentially malicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by executing system commands during installation and exfiltrating system information to an external server without consent. This behavior suggests it is malicious or at least highly suspicious, designed for covert data collection.",
