{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script that executes a command to retrieve system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system command output via subprocess.check_output(['id']) and encoded_result from this output.",
  "sinks": "The encoded system information is sent via an HTTP PUT request to a specified external server.",
  "flows": "The system command output is captured, base64-encoded, and then transmitted over the network to the remote server during the custom install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically executes a system command ('id') and transmits the output to a remote server without user consent or explicit permission. The server URL appears hardcoded. The purpose of transmitting this data is suspicious. No user input validation is present. The code is embedded within a setup process, which can be used to hide malicious activity during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the package installation process by defining a custom install command. During installation, it runs the 'id' command to retrieve system user info, encodes the output, and sends it to a specific external server via an HTTP PUT request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration. The hardcoded server URL and automatic execution without user approval are suspicious. The code does not perform any obvious malicious actions like damaging files, executing reverse shells, or mining cryptocurrencies, but the pattern of silently sending system data to an external server suggests potential malicious intent. The use of standard modules and straightforward logic reduces the likelihood of obfuscation or code manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an automated collection and transmission of system information during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. It exfiltrates user data without consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
