  "purpose": "Custom setup script that executes a command and sends data to a remote server during installation",
  "sources": "exec_command() executes 'id' command; send_put_request() reads network response; subprocess.check_output(['id']) reads system info",
  "sinks": "send_put_request() sends data over HTTP connection to external server",
  "flows": "exec_command() captures 'id' output -> encodes it -> passes to send_put_request() -> HTTP request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of executing system command during package installation and transmitting data externally without user consent; no visible hardcoded credentials but actively transmits system info",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process that, during installation, executes the 'id' command to gather system information. The output is base64-encoded and sent via an HTTP PUT request to a specified remote server. The network communication occurs automatically during installation, which could be used for malicious data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets are present, but the act of transmitting system info without user awareness is suspicious. The code does not contain obfuscated or complex code patterns; however, the purpose of transmitting 'id' output during install raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and transmits it to an external server during package installation, which is suspicious behavior indicating potential data exfiltration. There are no hardcoded credentials or malware signatures, but the automatic external communication and execution of system commands are security risks.",
