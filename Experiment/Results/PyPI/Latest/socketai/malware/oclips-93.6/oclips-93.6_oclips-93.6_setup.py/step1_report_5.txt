{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'oclips', which customizes the installation process to run a function from 'main' after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'main' module during the custom install step.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'main()' in the custom install method could execute arbitrary code if 'main' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method calls 'main()' from the 'main' module, which may execute arbitrary or malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes 'main()' after installation without any validation or restrictions; no code signatures or checks are present. The setup script itself appears standard but the invocation of external code in post-install step is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that runs 'main()' from the 'main' module after installation. This behavior is unusual and potentially malicious because it executes code during package installation. There are no indications of obfuscation or encrypted code. The 'main' module is not shown, so its contents are unknown. The setup dependencies seem benign ('requests', 'psutil'), but the execution of 'main()' could be exploited if the 'main' module contains malicious logic or if the package is tampered with. Overall, the key concern is the post-installation execution of external code without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard setup with a suspicious custom install step that executes 'main()' from an external module during installation. This behavior can be exploited for malicious purposes such as executing arbitrary code or backdoors. The package should be reviewed carefully before use.",
