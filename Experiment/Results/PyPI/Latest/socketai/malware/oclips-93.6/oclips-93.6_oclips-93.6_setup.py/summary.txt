  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting the uncertainty and danger of arbitrary code execution during installation. Further inspection of the 'main' module is recommended before deploying or trusting this package."
