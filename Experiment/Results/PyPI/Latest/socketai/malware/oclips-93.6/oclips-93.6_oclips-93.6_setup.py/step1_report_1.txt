{
  "purpose": "The setup script is used to package and install a Python project named 'oclips', including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements, the setup configuration, and the 'main' module import within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' within the custom install class after installation could be a sink if 'main()' executes arbitrary or malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method invokes 'install.run(self)', then dynamically imports and executes 'main()' from 'main'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes executing 'main()' from an imported module immediately after installation, which could trigger arbitrary code execution. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for packaging, defining a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method. After the standard install process, it imports and executes 'main()' from 'main'. This behavior could be intended for post-install setup but is also potentially malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code. The setup configuration appears normal with specified dependencies. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns besides the post-install execution.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the execution of 'main()' after installation, which could be malicious if 'main()' performs harmful actions. Without inspecting 'main()', this behavior presents a security risk, especially in supply chain contexts. The rest of the code appears standard for a setup script.",
