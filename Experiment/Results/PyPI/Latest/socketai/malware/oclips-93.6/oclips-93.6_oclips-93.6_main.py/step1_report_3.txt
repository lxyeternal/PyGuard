{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses) and send it via HTTP requests to external URLs, potentially for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading platform information (platform.node), user credentials (getpass.getuser), current directory (os.getcwd), MAC addresses via subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen for sending data to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) collected and encoded, then transmitted through GET requests to external URLs with query parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, encoding MAC addresses in base64, no error handling beyond silent pass, presence of hardcoded URLs possibly used for data exfiltration, and gathering system info without explicit user consent. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses from the system. MAC addresses are encoded in base64 and sent as part of URL parameters to three external domains that appear suspicious. The use of subprocess to invoke system commands to retrieve MAC addresses varies depending on OS. The data is transmitted via GET requests without any response processing or validation. The code does not contain malicious commands or data leaks beyond info gathering, but it operates in a manner consistent with potentially tracking or reconnaissance activity. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are explicitly present. The domains used are suspicious and could be part of a malicious C2 infrastructure or tracking network.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily gathering system info and exfiltrating it to external domains that appear suspicious. While it does not contain explicit malicious payloads like file manipulation or system damage, it demonstrates suspicious data collection and transmission behaviors that warrant caution. It may be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance, but lacks direct malware actions.",
