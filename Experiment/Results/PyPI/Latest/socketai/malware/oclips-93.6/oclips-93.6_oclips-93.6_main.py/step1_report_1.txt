  "purpose": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and then sends this data to multiple URLs via GET requests with encoded parameters.",
  "sources": "System functions (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), get_mac_addresses() function which reads MAC addresses from system commands.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs with query parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from system info functions flow into URL parameters, which are then sent over the network via urlopen() to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses and sending this encoded data to external domains without user consent. The URLs used are suspicious and resemble command-and-control or malicious domains. The code does not handle responses, only attempts to send data. The random number is generated and used as part of URL query parameters, possibly for session tracking or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host-specific information: hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses using system-specific commands. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs from a predefined list of suspicious domains. Data is sent via HTTP GET requests with URL-encoded parameters to these domains. No user interaction or user consent is apparent. The code silently handles exceptions during network requests, preventing detection of failures. The external domains are suspicious, and sending system details without explicit user approval poses privacy concerns. The use of random numbers in URLs suggests possible tracking or obfuscation. The code structure appears straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code constructs, but the behavior indicates potential privacy invasion or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it to suspicious external servers without user consent, indicating malicious intent or at least privacy-invasive behavior. The overall behavior resembles data exfiltration typical of malware, with no legitimate purpose evident. The presence of suspicious domains and encoding methods heighten concern. This script should be considered malicious or security-threatening.",
