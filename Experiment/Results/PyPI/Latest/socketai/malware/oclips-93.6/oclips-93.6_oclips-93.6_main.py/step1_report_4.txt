  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, encode MAC addresses, and send this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send data to external URLs with encoded system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered, MAC addresses are encoded in base64, then included as URL parameters in GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, encoding of MAC addresses, and network activity that occurs without user interaction or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system-specific identifiers like hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, then sent as URL parameters to three external domains, which appear suspicious and potentially malicious. The URLs are non-standard, possibly malicious or tracking domains. The code executes network requests in a loop, which could be for data exfiltration or tracking. No user prompts or obvious benign purposes are present. No input validation or user consent is observed. The data transmission occurs unconditionally in the main() function, indicating potential privacy violation and unauthorized data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system data and transmitting it to suspicious external domains without user consent. The purpose appears to be data exfiltration or tracking, suggesting a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
