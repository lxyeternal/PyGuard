  "conclusion": "The code performs privacy-invasive data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains without user consent, indicating high malicious potential. The behavior warrants high security concern, and the scores in the reports are appropriate. Slightly increasing malware and risk scores provides a more conservative assessment of its maliciousness."
