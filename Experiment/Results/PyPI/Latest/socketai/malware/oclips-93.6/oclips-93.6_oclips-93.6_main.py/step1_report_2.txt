  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to remote servers via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "System commands (getmac, ifconfig), platform information, environment variables (getpass.getuser), current working directory.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen to send HTTP GET requests with encoded system info to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info (MAC addresses, hostname, username, directory) are collected, encoded in base64, then included as URL parameters in HTTP requests to remote URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domains; collection and transmission of potentially sensitive system info; encoding MAC addresses; no explicit user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers MAC addresses through system commands, retrieves hostname, username, and current directory, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs pointing to seemingly suspicious domains and sends system info via HTTP GET requests without any encryption or user awareness. The data collection and transmission are consistent with potentially malicious behavior aimed at tracking or exfiltration. The code does not perform any harmful system modifications, but the transmission of system identifiers to unknown external servers indicates a high privacy risk. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft mechanisms are present beyond the data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to collect system identifiers and transmit them to external, suspicious domains, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent related to system tracking or data exfiltration. It does not contain obvious backdoors or malware payloads, but its behavior is suspicious and warrants caution.",
