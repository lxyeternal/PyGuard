{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python package and includes a custom post-installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the network via requests.get() to download a file from a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable is saved locally and then executed via os.system(), potentially executing malicious code on the system.",
  "flows": "The flow starts with the install process, then calls send(), which downloads a file from the internet and runs it immediately after installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatically downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which is highly atypical and suspicious. No validation or verification of the downloaded file is performed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'send' that fetches an executable from a remote URL and executes it directly after download. This function is called during the custom post-install command 'PostInstallCommand', which overrides the default setup install process. The download URL points to a potentially malicious executable, and executing it without user consent or verification introduces a significant security risk. This behavior resembles malware, as it can silently install harmful software during package installation. The code structure indicates intent to run external code automatically, violating security best practices. No obfuscation or encryption techniques are used; the malicious intent is explicit.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is designed to download and execute an external executable during installation, which is a clear security risk and likely malicious behavior. The package can potentially infect systems with harmful software upon installation. This code should be considered dangerous and should not be used in production or trusted environments.",
