{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup that, upon installation, downloads and executes an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The send() function retrieves data from an external URL and writes it to a local file.",
  "sinks": "The open(filename, 'wb').write(rqs.content) writes external content to disk; os.system('start ' + filename) executes the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "The send() function is called during the custom post-install process, which downloads a file from an external URL and then executes it.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable during installation without user consent or verification, which is highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and requests library, then defines a send() function that downloads an executable from a hardcoded URL and immediately executes it. A custom install class overrides the default to call this function after installation. The setup() function includes this custom command, causing the external file to be downloaded and run whenever the package is installed. This behavior resembles malicious activity, as it can deliver arbitrary executables without user knowledge. No obfuscation or malicious code obfuscation techniques are used; the code is straightforward but intentionally malicious in its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to download and execute an external executable during package installation, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent or malware distribution. The package should be considered dangerous and not used.",
