  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging of a Python library named 'notoken887' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "User input includes package metadata, package discovery via find_packages(), and entry point definition for console script.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external data interactions present.",
  "flows": "Metadata and package configuration flow into packaging process; entry points specify executable script.",
  "anomalies": "Author email is a well-known historical figure's email address, which may be inappropriate or suspicious but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package details, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, no external data fetching, no suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or embedded malicious code. The package description mentions 'obfuscation test lib' but provides no evidence of actual obfuscation or malicious intent. The author email is unusual but not inherently malicious. No anomalies in code structure or logic are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a typical package configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is likely intended for package distribution, with no security risks evident in this code.",
