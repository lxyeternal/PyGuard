  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, author, author_email, url, description, long_description, classifiers, python_requires, entry_points.",
  "sinks": "None; no dynamic input, external data fetching, or code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') which are unprofessional and potentially provocative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no dynamic or malicious code. The only notable signals are the suspicious contact info and URL, which could indicate untrustworthiness but do not constitute malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The security risk scores vary slightly, reflecting metadata concerns but no active threats. The code itself is benign; the metadata warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; the primary concern is the suspicious metadata, which could be used for social engineering or misdirection but does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), mainly due to metadata concerns. No active malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
