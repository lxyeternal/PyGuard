  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; the primary concern is the suspicious metadata, which could be used for social engineering or misdirection but does not contain malicious code or obfuscation. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), mainly due to metadata concerns. No active malicious behavior or obfuscation detected."
