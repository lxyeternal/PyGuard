  "conclusion": "The code pattern involves dynamic decryption and execution, which is inherently risky and can be exploited maliciously if the encrypted content or TokenCryptor is compromised. No explicit malicious payloads are present, but the pattern warrants caution. The overall security risk is moderate, with low malware likelihood but high potential for misuse in supply chain scenarios."
