{
  "purpose": "The script downloads and executes a remote executable, sets it to run at startup, potentially to establish persistence.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET request to fetch 'https://github.com/GODOFTHUGS/sounds/raw/main/stealer.exe' and reading environment variables for APPDATA.",
  "sinks": "Saving the downloaded file to disk, creating a shortcut in the startup folder, executing the downloaded file with subprocess.Popen.",
  "flows": "HTTP response content -> Save as 'stealer.exe' -> Create shortcut in startup folder -> Execute 'stealer.exe'.",
  "anomalies": "Downloads executable directly from a remote URL, creates a shortcut in startup folder, runs executable without validation, uses 'shell=True' in subprocess which can be unsafe.",
  "analysis": "The code downloads an executable from a remote source, which is suspicious. It then adds a shortcut to the Windows startup folder, ensuring persistence. The execution of the downloaded file is done with 'shell=True', which is potentially unsafe, and the filename 'stealer.exe' suggests malicious intent. No checks are performed to verify the executable's integrity or origin. The code's purpose aligns with typical malware behaviors such as remote code execution, persistence, and potential data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to perform malicious activities by downloading, executing, and persisting a potentially harmful executable. The use of a suspicious URL, filename, and the behavior of establishing persistence indicate high malicious intent.",
