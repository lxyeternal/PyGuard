  "purpose": "Minimal package module serving as an entry point or metadata holder for the Pojang Resorter CLI package.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.main', package metadata variables (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import statement and metadata definitions, with no data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initialization module containing a docstring, an import statement, and metadata variables. It lacks data processing, network activity, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. All indicators point to benign, standard package setup. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The high confidence scores are justified given the code's clarity and simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
