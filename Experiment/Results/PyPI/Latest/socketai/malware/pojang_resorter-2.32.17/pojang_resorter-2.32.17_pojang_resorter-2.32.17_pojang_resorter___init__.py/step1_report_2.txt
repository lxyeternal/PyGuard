  "purpose": "Provides basic metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The __version__ and __author__ variables, and the import statement from .main",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines metadata and imports a module",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining package metadata and importing a main module. No input handling, no network activity, or sensitive data processing detected. The import is relative, assuming a local main module, typical for package entry points. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module entry point with package metadata. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
