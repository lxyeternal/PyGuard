{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool by importing main functionalities and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be processed or leaked are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code; it's primarily a module initialization file.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with standard package metadata and an import statement; no unusual code, secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a package with minimal metadata and imports a 'main' function from a local module. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network operations, or other suspicious behaviors. The import of 'main' suggests this is part of a larger package, but on its own, it shows no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It simply sets metadata and imports a main function for the CLI tool. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
