  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths identifiable in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module docstring, import statement, version, and author metadata. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The import suggests reliance on a local 'main' module, but no malicious patterns are visible in this snippet. The code appears to be a straightforward package module definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple package initialization or module descriptor with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
