  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a minimal module that:\n  - Contains a docstring describing it as \"Pojang Resorter Package.\"\n  - Imports `main` from a local module `.main`.\n  - Defines `__version__` and `__author__` metadata variables.\n\n**Assessment of the Code:**\n- The code is straightforward, typical for a package's `__init__.py` or main module.\n- No data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n- The import is local and standard for Python packages.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Describes core functionality as an entry point/module.\n- Findings: No suspicious activity, benign.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Metadata and import.\n- Findings: No anomalies, no malicious patterns.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above, package metadata and import.\n- Findings: No suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1.0\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, matches the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Package initialization.\n- Findings: No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Basic package setup.\n- Findings: No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Verification and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is benign, minimal, and standard.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate given the code snippet.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All are 0, which is appropriate. The code shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable here; all scores are zero, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Correctly zero; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No, all reports rely on observable code features.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  Fully consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and shows no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and appropriate. No changes needed. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that.",
