{
  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot and send it to multiple webhook URLs, likely for remote monitoring or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The code reads webhook URLs from a hardcoded list and captures screenshots using PIL.ImageGrab.grab().",
  "sinks": "The code sends images to external webhook URLs via HTTP POST requests using the requests library.",
  "flows": "Screenshot is captured (source) -> saved in memory -> sent via POST request to each webhook URL (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URLs with generic tokens; no user input or environment variables; no obvious data exfiltration beyond sending screenshots.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and third-party libraries. It sets up logging, defines a list of static webhook URLs, and captures a screenshot using PIL.ImageGrab. The screenshot is saved to an in-memory buffer and then posted to each webhook URL. The URLs contain what appear to be valid Discord webhook endpoints, and the code logs success or failure for each send operation. There is no evidence of code obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or data harvesting beyond sending screenshots. The intent seems to be remote monitoring or possibly malicious surveillance if used without user consent. No hardcoded credentials are present besides the webhook URLs. No suspicious code patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or reverse shells are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate screenshot capture and reporting via webhooks. It does not exhibit malicious intent or contain malicious code, but the use of static webhook URLs and in-memory screenshot transfer could be abused for unauthorized surveillance. Overall, it appears to be a surveillance or monitoring tool rather than malware, but the potential for misuse is high if deployed without user awareness.",
