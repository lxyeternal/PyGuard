  "conclusion": "The main script is benign and functions as a command dispatcher. The security risk depends on the trustworthiness of external scripts, which are executed without validation. The code itself does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The risk score should be kept low, around 0.2, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. Given the potential for external script compromise, implementing checksum verification or code signing is recommended for enhanced security."
