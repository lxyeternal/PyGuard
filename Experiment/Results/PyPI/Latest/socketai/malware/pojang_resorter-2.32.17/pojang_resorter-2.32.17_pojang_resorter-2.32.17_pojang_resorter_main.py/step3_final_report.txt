  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool that maps user commands to specific Python scripts and executes them via subprocess.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument parsing, script name mapping, and script existence check.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing external scripts based on user input.",
  "flows": "User input -> command mapping -> script path verification -> subprocess.run() to execute script.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no code signing or checksum verification; reliance on external scripts without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command dispatcher that executes external scripts based on user commands. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code itself. The primary security concern is executing external scripts that could be compromised if the environment or filesystem is untrusted. The code performs minimal validation, only checking for script existence. No validation of script integrity or authenticity is performed. The risk stems from the external scripts' trustworthiness, not the main code. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, considering the potential for malicious scripts if environment is compromised. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious payloads are noted, but external script integrity remains the main concern.",
  "conclusion": "The main script is benign and functions as a command dispatcher. The security risk depends on the trustworthiness of external scripts, which are executed without validation. The code itself does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The risk score should be kept low, around 0.2, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. Given the potential for external script compromise, implementing checksum verification or code signing is recommended for enhanced security.",
