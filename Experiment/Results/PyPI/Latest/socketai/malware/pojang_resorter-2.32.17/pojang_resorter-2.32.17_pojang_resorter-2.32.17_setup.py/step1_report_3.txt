{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'pojang_resorter', including its dependencies and entry point.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads package metadata, dependencies (install_requires), and entry points; all are static definitions without runtime input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling within this script, as it solely provides package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script is static configuration code only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all dependencies and configurations are typical for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to specify package info, dependencies, and console scripts. All dependencies listed are common libraries related to GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing. There is no code execution, no dynamic code, nor any suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns are present. The code performs a typical package setup configuration without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely specifies dependencies and entry points for the package 'pojang_resorter'.",
