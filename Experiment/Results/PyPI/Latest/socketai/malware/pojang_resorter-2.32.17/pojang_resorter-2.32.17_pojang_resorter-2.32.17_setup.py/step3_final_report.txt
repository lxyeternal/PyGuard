{
  "purpose": "Defines the package configuration for installation, specifying dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters: name, version, packages, install_requires, entry_points, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or runtime data handling; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow or code execution beyond package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; dependencies are standard, and no dynamic code or network activity is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. All listed dependencies are common open-source packages related to GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing. The entry point specifies a console script, which is typical for CLI tools. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The script does not execute any code at runtime besides package installation configuration. The absence of dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input indicates a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
