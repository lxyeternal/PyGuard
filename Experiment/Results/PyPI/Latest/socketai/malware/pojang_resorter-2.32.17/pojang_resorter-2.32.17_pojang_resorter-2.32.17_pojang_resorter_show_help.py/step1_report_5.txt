  "purpose": "To provide a command-line interface (CLI) help message for the Pojang Resorter tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse.ArgumentParser",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or security issues; no untrusted data handling beyond argument parsing",
  "flows": "Input from command line flows into argparse to determine command choices and display help",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only displays help information",
  "analysis": "The code imports argparse to handle command-line arguments, defines a function to show help information with a description and command choices, and calls this function if the script is executed directly. No user input is processed beyond argparse's standard handling. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No data leaks or security-sensitive operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI help display script with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility for user guidance.",
