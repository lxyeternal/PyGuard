{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool that displays help information for a set of predefined commands related to a Pojang Resorter application.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via argparse.ArgumentParser and the 'command' positional argument.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data directly; the code only displays help information.",
  "flows": "User inputs a command; argparse parses and validates it; show_help() displays help details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and only implements help display.",
  "analysis": "The script imports argparse for command-line argument parsing, defines a function show_help() that initializes an ArgumentParser with a description, adds a command argument with specific choices, and calls print_help(). The main block calls show_help() to display usage instructions. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond command-line arguments, and no data is processed insecurely. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI help display utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations beyond showing help information for predefined commands.",
