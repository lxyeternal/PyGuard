{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) help display for the 'Pojang Resorter' tool.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command-line argument 'command' via argparse, used to determine user instructions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks such as network communication, file writing, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code reads command-line arguments (source) and displays help information (sink). There are no complex data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'show_help' that initializes an ArgumentParser with a description and a command argument restricted to specific choices. It then prints the help message. When executed directly, it calls this function. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious commands, or suspicious behavior. The code solely displays help information based on predefined choices, with no dynamic or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely presents help info for valid commands and does not process untrusted data or perform any malicious actions.",
