  "purpose": "A simple CLI help utility using argparse to display help information for predefined commands.",
  "sources": "The command-line argument 'command' input, which is restricted to specific choices.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only prints help information without external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument 'command' flows into argparse's choice validation, then to print_help().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function show_help() that creates an ArgumentParser, adds a 'command' argument with specific choices, and prints help. The main block calls show_help(). No untrusted data is processed beyond argument validation, and no external system calls or malicious code are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is solely to display help info, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's functionality and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
