  "purpose": "Import 'perm' from local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data or inputs involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions affecting system security.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard import statement with no dynamic behavior, data processing, or external interactions. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The minimal nature of the code indicates a benign intent, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores should reflect this, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. The reports are accurate and consistent; no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
