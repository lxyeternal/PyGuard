  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .main import perm`.\n- The code is a simple import statement, referencing a local module `main`.\n- No dynamic code execution, external data, or complex logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores mostly at 0, with some variation in confidence and security risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code `from .main import perm` is present in all reports.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports indicate any malicious activity; all assign malware scores of 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree the code is straightforward and non-obfuscated.\n- **Risk assessment:** The overall security risk is minimal, given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Logical consistency and scoring:\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, aligning with the code's clarity.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which seems reasonable for such a minimal import statement.\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Confidence scores:** Range from 0.8 to 1, reflecting certainty about benign nature. This seems appropriate.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above 0 (0.1) in some reports, which could be justified as a conservative default in case of incomplete context. Given the code's simplicity, a score of 0 or 0.1 is reasonable.\n- **Scores higher than 0.5:** None are assigned, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- No issues are apparent in the reports' reasoning or scoring.\n- The conclusion in all reports aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0, given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Could be further lowered to 0, considering the code is benign and straightforward, unless there's an external context indicating otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if a conservative default is preferred)\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and reasonable. No changes needed unless additional context suggests otherwise.**",
