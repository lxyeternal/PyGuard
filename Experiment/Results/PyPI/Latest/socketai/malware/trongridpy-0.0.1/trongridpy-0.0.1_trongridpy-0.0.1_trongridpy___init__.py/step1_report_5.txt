  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows detected; import statement does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a single import statement; no anomalies or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol 'perm' from a local module named 'main'. There is no evidence of data manipulation, input reading, or untrusted data sources. The import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or suspicious characteristics. It appears benign and typical for Python projects.",
