  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: `from .main import perm` (or similar variations).\n- The code is a straightforward import statement, with no data processing, dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1), and no anomalies or malware are indicated.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n**Specific analysis:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code snippet is simple and standard; no issues are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly identify the benign nature of the import statement.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is just an import statement, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - No malicious intent or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested by the code.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No such claims are made; all assessments correctly note the benign nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code snippet's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- The code is benign; no issues are present.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The reports are accurate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (since no security risk is present)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports correctly identify this, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No further action or concern is necessary.",
