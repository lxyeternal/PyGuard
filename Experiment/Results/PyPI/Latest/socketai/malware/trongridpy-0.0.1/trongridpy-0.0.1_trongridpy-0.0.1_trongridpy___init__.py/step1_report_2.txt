  "purpose": "Importing the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'main' to import 'perm'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A - only a single import statement, no data flow or execution flow visible.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears as a straightforward import statement with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'perm' from a local module named 'main'. This is a standard import statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Without additional context, it appears as a simple, benign import. The minimal nature of this code limits the ability to assess malicious intent fully, but based on this fragment alone, no suspicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. The code is straightforward and does not raise concerns based solely on this snippet.",
