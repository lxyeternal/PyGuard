  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.main' as a source.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local module '.main' into the current namespace via 'perm'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and only involves an import statement; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'perm' from the relative module '.main'. It does not contain any dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or external data sources. Its simplicity suggests it's a standard import with no malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious flows, or hidden behaviors within this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a larger codebase.",
