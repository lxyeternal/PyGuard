  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .main import perm\n```\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a simple import statement importing 'perm' from a local module 'main'.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external inputs.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears as a standard part of a larger codebase.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import 'perm' from local 'main'.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the minimal, benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also accurate, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) is reasonable given the minimal code, but since no suspicious activity is detected, this could be lowered to 0.0 for consistency. The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Similar to above, the securityRisk score could be adjusted to 0, as there's no evidence of risk. The malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no indication of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** Most reports assign a small risk (0.1), but given the code's simplicity and benign nature, this should be lowered to 0 across all reports for consistency.\n- **Confidence:** High confidence (1) or near (0.8-0.9) is justified given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores should reflect the benign nature: **malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0**.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk scores (0.1) in some reports are unwarranted based solely on this code fragment.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the minimal nature of the code snippet.",
