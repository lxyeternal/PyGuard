  "purpose": "Send transaction data containing a private key to a remote API and retrieve switcher status",
  "sources": "Reading the 'private_key' parameter and the 'switcher' API response",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to external domain with private key data, HTTP GET request to external domain",
  "flows": "Input 'private_key' -> transaction_data -> requests.post -> requests.get -> switcher.json() -> control flow decision",
  "anomalies": "Use of a set with a typo in 'private_key' key ('ptivat_key'), potential exposure of private key via HTTP POST, no validation or sanitization, hardcoded URL domain",
  "analysis": "The function 'perm' takes a private key, constructs a data set with a typo in the key name ('ptivat_key'), and sends it via a POST request to an external API. It then performs a GET request to another endpoint to retrieve a switcher value. The code potentially exposes sensitive information (private key) over network. The use of a set for 'transaction_data' is unusual, as JSON expects a dictionary, which could cause unintended behavior. The URL endpoints are hardcoded and external, raising privacy and security concerns. The logic itself does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft, but the handling of private keys and external communication raises security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code potentially leaks a private key to an external server without validation or encryption, posing security and privacy risks. The typos and data handling are suspicious but do not definitively indicate malicious intent. The code should be reviewed further for intent, but current analysis suggests a high risk of privacy leakage.",
