  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high security risk primarily due to transmitting private keys to external servers without encryption or validation, leading to potential privacy breaches. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or active malware. The repeated typos and improper data structures suggest poor coding practices or obfuscation, but do not constitute malware. The scores from the reports are consistent with these findings. The primary concern is data exfiltration, and the code should be fixed to use proper data structures, secure transmission, and validation to mitigate risks."
