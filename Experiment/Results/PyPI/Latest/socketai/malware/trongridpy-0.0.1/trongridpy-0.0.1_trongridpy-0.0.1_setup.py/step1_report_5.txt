{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'trongridpy', used to package and distribute the library via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and static package metadata such as name, version, author, and repository URL.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only sets package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md file as input for long description, then proceeds to set up package parameters with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and uses standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets beyond author email, which is typical and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools and Path from pathlib to read the README file. It constructs a long description from the README file content. The setup() function defines package metadata, dependencies, author info, and repository URL. All elements are static and standard for Python package setup. There are no user inputs, untrusted data sources, or dynamic behaviors that could introduce security risks. The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or execute external code. The repository URL points to a public GitHub repository, which is typical for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely defines package metadata for distribution. No signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are present.",
