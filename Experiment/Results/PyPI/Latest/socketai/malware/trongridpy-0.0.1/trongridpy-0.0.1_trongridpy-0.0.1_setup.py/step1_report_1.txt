  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'trongridpy' including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description, package discovery via find_packages(), static package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external input or data handling present in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; package metadata is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; standard setup script structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and repository links. It reads a README file for the long description and specifies package requirements. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The email and URL appear to be placeholders or benign, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It serves its intended purpose without security concerns.",
