  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'trongridpy', used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no other external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling; no data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static package setup information.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior. The code adheres to standard setup script practices. The email address appears to be a personal email but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and pathlib to read a README file for the long description, then defines package metadata including name, version, author info, description, dependencies, and repository URL. All operations are standard for Python package distribution. No user input, external commands, or dynamic code execution are present. The presence of a GitHub URL and email address are typical for open-source packages. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely provides package metadata for distribution.",
