  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; static package metadata; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, reading a README file, and defining package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward nature. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities are evident. The code functions solely for package distribution, with no indicators of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The reports and scores are accurate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
