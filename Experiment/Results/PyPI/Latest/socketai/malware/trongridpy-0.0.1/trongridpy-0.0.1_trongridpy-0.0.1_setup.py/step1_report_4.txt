{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'trongridpy' Python package including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file from the filesystem to obtain long description; static metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external input processing.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup utilities from setuptools and reads a local README file for documentation. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and project URLs. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no hardcoded credentials or hidden network activities, and no dynamic code execution. The dependencies are minimal and legitimate. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely prepares the package for distribution.",
