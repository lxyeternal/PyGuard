  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code content and behavior**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code only declares a class `TLSClientExeption` inheriting from `IOError`. There are no data sources, sinks, or data flows. No executable logic, network activity, or external interactions are present. The class contains only a docstring.\n\n2. **Typo / Anomaly**:  \n   The only notable anomaly is the misspelling of \"Exception\" as \"Exeption\" in the class name. This is consistent across all reports and is identified as likely a typo rather than obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Malicious activity and security risks**:  \n   All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code is benign, intended solely for exception handling.\n\n4. **Scores and justifications**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk score**: Ranges from 0.8 to 1, with the highest at 0.9, primarily due to the typo.\n\n**Critical observations**:\n- The typo in the class name, while not malicious, could cause bugs or confusion in a real project.\n- The high security risk scores seem to be primarily based on the typo anomaly, which does not constitute a security risk.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The high confidence levels (mostly 0.8 to 1) are justified given the straightforward analysis.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is correct.\n- The risk score could be slightly lowered to reflect that the only issue is a typo, not a security concern, but since the scores are consistent and conservative, they are acceptable.\n\n**Overall conclusion**:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- The only issue is a typo in the class name, which does not impact security.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score**: **0**\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0**\n- **Risk score**: **0.2** (to reflect a minor issue—typo—but not a security risk)\n\nThis provides a balanced view, acknowledging the typo but emphasizing the benign nature of the code.",
