  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for TLS client errors",
  "sources": "No external data input sources in the provided code",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines a class",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in class name: 'TLSClientExeption' likely intended to be 'TLSClientException'; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of IOError intended to represent TLS client errors. It contains a typo in the class name, which could lead to confusion or bugs, but it does not perform any actions, data processing, or network communication. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and limited to class definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition with a typo in the class name. There is no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risk present.",
