  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines a class `TLSClientExeption` inheriting from `IOError`.\n   - The class only contains a docstring; no methods, attributes, or executable code.\n   - There are no data flows, external inputs/outputs, or network operations.\n   - The purpose is to serve as a custom exception class for TLS client errors.\n\n2. **Issues Identified:**\n   - The class name `TLSClientExeption` appears to be a misspelling of `TLSClientException`. This is consistent across all reports.\n   - No other anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious activity.\n   - The main concern is the typo in the class name, which could cause bugs or confusion but does not imply malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are high, and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate since there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and simple.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0.0 or very close, because this is just a class declaration with a typo, not a security vulnerability.\n\n5. **Potential Adjustments:**\n   - The reports' scores seem reasonable. No adjustments needed unless the typo is considered a security concern, which it isn't in this context.\n   - The typo could be flagged as a code quality issue but not as a security risk.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - The only notable aspect is the typo in the class name, which is unlikely to cause security issues but could lead to bugs if used elsewhere.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment. No further action is necessary beyond noting the typo for code correctness.",
