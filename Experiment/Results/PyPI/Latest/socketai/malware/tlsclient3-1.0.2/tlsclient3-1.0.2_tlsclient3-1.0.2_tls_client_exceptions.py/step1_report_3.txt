  "flows": "No data flow; only class definition",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in class name: 'TLSClientExeption' instead of 'TLSClientException'",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from IOError with a descriptive docstring. It contains no executable code, no input/output, and no suspicious logic. The misspelling of 'Exception' as 'Exeption' may be a typo but does not indicate malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition intended for error handling related to TLS clients. No malicious behavior or security issues are present. The only notable aspect is the typo in the class name, which could cause confusion or bugs.",
