  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n- The code defines a class `TLSClientExeption` inheriting from `IOError`.\n- The class contains only a docstring; no methods, attributes, or executable code.\n- The class name appears to be a misspelling of `TLSClientException`. This typo is consistent across reports.\n- There are no data flows, input/output, or external dependencies.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious code is present.\n- The code is benign and serves as a custom exception class.\n\n---\n\n### Issues Identified:\n- **Typographical error:** The class name `TLSClientExeption` is likely intended to be `TLSClientException`. This is a minor issue but could lead to bugs or confusion if used elsewhere.\n\n### Security and Malware Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.8–1 in some reports, but these are based solely on the typo, which is not a security risk but could cause functional issues.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent: the code is simple, benign, and contains a typo.\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no data flows, no external data, and no malicious intent.\n- The only concern is the typo, which is not malicious but could cause bugs.\n\n### Score Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** Since the only issue is a typo, which is a minor bug rather than a security risk, a risk score of around 0.1–0.2 seems more appropriate than 0.8–1.0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward class definition with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The typo does not constitute a security risk but may impact code correctness.\n- Therefore, the overall risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect the typo's potential for bugs but not security issues)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to provide a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
