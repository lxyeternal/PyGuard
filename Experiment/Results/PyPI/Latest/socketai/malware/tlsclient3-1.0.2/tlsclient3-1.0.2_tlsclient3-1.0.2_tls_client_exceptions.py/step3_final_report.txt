  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for TLS client errors.",
  "sources": "Class declaration, inherits from IOError, contains only a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, no external interactions, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class declaration is static with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in class name: 'TLSClientExeption' instead of 'TLSClientException'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class declaration with no executable logic, data flow, or external dependencies. The only anomaly is the consistent misspelling of 'Exception' as 'Exeption'. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity. The typo, while potentially causing bugs, does not pose a security threat. The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward analysis. Overall, the code is benign, with a minor typo that should be corrected for clarity but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class declaration with a typo in the class name. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The only issue is the typo, which should be fixed for correctness, but it does not constitute a security concern.",
