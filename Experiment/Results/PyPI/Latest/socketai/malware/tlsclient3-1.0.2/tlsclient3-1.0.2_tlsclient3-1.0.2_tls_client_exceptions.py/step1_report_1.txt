  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for TLS client errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'TLSClientExeption' appears to be a misspelling of 'TLSClientException', which could indicate a typo or obfuscation, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a custom exception class inheriting from IOError, intended for TLS client errors. The class contains only a docstring and no methods or attributes. The misspelling of 'Exception' as 'Exeption' is notable but does not suggest malicious intent; it may be an unintentional typo. There are no suspicious code behaviors, external data handling, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign class definition with a typo in the class name. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are detected.",
