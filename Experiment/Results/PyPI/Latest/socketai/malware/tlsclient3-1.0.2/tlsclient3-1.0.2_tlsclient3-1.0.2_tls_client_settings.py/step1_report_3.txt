{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'ClientIdentifiers' representing specific string literals for various client versions and platforms.",
  "sources": "Static data within the code; no external data input or data reading mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only declares a type alias with predefined string literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; straightforward type alias definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' and 'TypeAlias' from 'typing_extensions' and defines a 'TypeAlias' named 'ClientIdentifiers' comprising a list of string literals for various browsers, platforms, and custom client identifiers. There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, network calls, or code execution mechanisms. The code appears to be a simple, static type definition for use in type checking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static type alias definition used for specifying valid client identifier strings. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
