{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a set of string literals representing various client identifiers for browsers and mobile platforms.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a static type alias.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code solely defines a constant type alias.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward type alias declaration with no unusual code or patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' and 'TypeAlias' from 'typing_extensions', then declares 'ClientIdentifiers' as a 'TypeAlias' for a list of string literals representing browser and mobile platform identifiers. There are no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The code is static and serves as a type definition. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines a type alias for client identifiers. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks. It is a benign, purely declarative code segment.",
