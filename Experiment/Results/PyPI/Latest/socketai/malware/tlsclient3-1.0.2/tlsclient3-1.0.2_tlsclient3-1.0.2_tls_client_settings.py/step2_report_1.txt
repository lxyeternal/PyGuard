  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a static type alias declaration using `Literal` for a set of string literals.\n   - There are no runtime operations, data flows, external inputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is purely declarative, intended for type safety or validation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, static, and contains no malicious or obfuscated patterns.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the code.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The scores of 0 or very close to 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and based on the actual static nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics.\n   - The assessments are aligned with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0 — The code is not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk associated with static type declarations.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code appears to be a well-structured, straightforward type alias for client identifiers, likely used for validation or type checking within a larger codebase.\n- There are no signs of supply chain security issues, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
