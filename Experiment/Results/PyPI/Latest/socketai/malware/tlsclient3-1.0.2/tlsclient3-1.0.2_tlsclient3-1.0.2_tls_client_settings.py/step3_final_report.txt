{
  "purpose": "Define a set of client identifiers as a static type alias for type safety and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static list of string literals used for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static type alias without dynamic or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' and 'TypeAlias' from 'typing_extensions' and defines 'ClientIdentifiers' as a union of string literals representing various browsers and platforms. It is purely declarative, serving as a type hint for validation. There are no runtime operations, data flows, external inputs, or malicious behaviors. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of the code and assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The scores are consistent with the code's characteristics, indicating no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static type alias declaration with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
