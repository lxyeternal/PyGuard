{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias 'ClientIdentifiers' as a set of specific string literals representing different client versions or platforms.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it solely defines a static type alias with string literals.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data sinks are present; this code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely a type alias declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' and 'TypeAlias' from 'typing_extensions', then defines 'ClientIdentifiers' as a type alias for a fixed set of string literals. This pattern is typical for defining restricted string value types, often used for validation or type safety. There are no external inputs, data manipulations, or dynamic behaviors. The code is purely declarative with no apparent malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard type alias definition intended to restrict client identifier strings to predefined values. No malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
