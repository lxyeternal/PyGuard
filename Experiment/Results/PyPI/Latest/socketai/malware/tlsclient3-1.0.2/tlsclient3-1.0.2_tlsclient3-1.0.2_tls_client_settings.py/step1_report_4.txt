{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for a fixed set of client identifiers, likely used for validation or typing enforcement in other parts of the codebase.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a constant list of string literals within a type alias.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths exist, as this is purely a type definition with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code does not process any untrusted input or perform any operations beyond defining a type alias.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comprehensive list of client identifiers, including various browsers and mobile platforms. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. It appears as a straightforward type alias declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations and defines a TypeAlias named 'ClientIdentifiers' as a Literal type with multiple string literals representing different browser and platform identifiers. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, no dynamic components, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The structure is simple and clear, serving as a static type constraint.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign type alias declaration intended for type safety and validation purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
