  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports confirm that the code is a static, straightforward type alias declaration using string literals.\n- They consistently identify no external inputs, no data flows, no dynamic behavior, and no malicious patterns.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a type hint for client identifiers.\n\n**Confirmations and potential issues:**\n- The code matches the description in all reports.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- The list of client identifiers appears comprehensive and well-structured.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The security risk score is 0, as expected.\n- Confidence is 1 across all reports, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or concerns:**\n- Since the code is static and contains no dynamic or external elements, there is no reason to adjust scores.\n- The reports do not identify any vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns, so their assessments seem accurate.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a safe, static type alias declaration for client identifiers. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports correctly reflect this, and their scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
