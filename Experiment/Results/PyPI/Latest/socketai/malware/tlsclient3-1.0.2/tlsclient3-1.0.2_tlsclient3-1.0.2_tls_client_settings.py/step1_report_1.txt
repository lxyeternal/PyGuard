{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for various client identifiers representing different browsers and platforms.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines a static type alias with string literals.",
  "targets": "The code itself does not include any runtime data flow or interaction with untrusted data; it is purely a type annotation.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as there are no functions or runtime operations, only type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward, static list of string literals used for type annotations. No unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type extensions and defines a type alias with string literals for client identifiers across various browsers and platforms. It is purely declarative, serving as a type hinting construct without runtime execution or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could lead to security issues, data leaks, or code injection. The code seems to be a legitimate part of a larger codebase, likely for input validation or type safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static type alias declaration for client identifiers. It poses no security threats, does not contain malware, and is not obfuscated. It is a straightforward, safe piece of code used for type annotations.",
