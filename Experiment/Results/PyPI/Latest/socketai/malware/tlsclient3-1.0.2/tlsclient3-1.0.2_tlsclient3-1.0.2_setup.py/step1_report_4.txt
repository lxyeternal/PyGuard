  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project, including data file collection and metadata extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '__version__.py' and reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'exec' to execute contents of '__version__.py', which may contain code execution. Reads 'README.md' content.",
  "flows": "Reads version info via exec, then uses it in setup() along with the README content for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute the contents of '__version__.py' is potentially risky if the file contains malicious code. Otherwise, typical setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks. It glob-matches directories for data files, reads version info via 'exec', and reads the README for long description. The 'exec' usage is a notable point, as it can execute arbitrary code if the version file is compromised. No other suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file manipulation beyond setup, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with a potential security concern due to the use of 'exec' on a version file. This could be exploited if the version file is maliciously modified. Overall, no malicious intent or malware is evident beyond this typical pattern.",
