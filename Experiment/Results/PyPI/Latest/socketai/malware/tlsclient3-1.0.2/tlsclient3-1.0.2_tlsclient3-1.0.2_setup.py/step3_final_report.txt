{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, reading metadata and package data, and preparing the package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__version__.py', reading README.md, globbing data files in 'tls_client/dependencies/' directory.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing code from '__version__.py', reading files with open() (though no dangerous sinks like network or database operations are present).",
  "flows": "Version info read via exec() from '__version__.py' -> executed during setup; data files globbed and included in package data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which can be risky if the version file is compromised; syntax errors in open() calls in some reports ('utf-8' as positional argument).",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with typical patterns. The use of exec() on version info is a known pattern but carries security risks if the version file is tampered with. The globbing of data files is straightforward. Syntax errors in open() calls in some reports are bugs, not malicious. No network activity, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are detected. The main concern is the exec() pattern, which is common but should be handled carefully. The syntax bugs prevent execution but are not security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with minor security considerations due to the use of exec() for loading version info. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Syntax errors are bugs, not malicious. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a slight risk score (~0.2) primarily due to exec().",
