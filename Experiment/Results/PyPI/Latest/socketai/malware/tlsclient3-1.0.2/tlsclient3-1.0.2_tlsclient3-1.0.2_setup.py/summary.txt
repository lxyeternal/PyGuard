  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with minor security considerations due to the use of exec() for loading version info. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Syntax errors are bugs, not malicious. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a slight risk score (~0.2) primarily due to exec()."
