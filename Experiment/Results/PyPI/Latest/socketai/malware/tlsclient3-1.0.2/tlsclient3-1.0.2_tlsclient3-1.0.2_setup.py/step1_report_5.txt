  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of a Python project, including data file inclusion and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'tls_client/__version__.py'; reading README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data used in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Version info and description read from files, used in setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Potential typo in 'open' function call: 'with open(os.path.join(here, \"tls_client\", \"__version__.py\"), \"r\", \"utf-8\") as f' — 'r' and 'utf-8' are incorrectly separated by a comma; should be 'encoding=\"utf-8\"'. Also, using exec() to execute version file contents can be risky if the file is maliciously modified, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard setup procedures: importing modules, reading metadata files, and configuring package data. It reads version info via exec() which, while common, can pose risks if the source file is compromised. The inclusion of all files in package data via '*', and glob usage, are typical. No network activity, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is observed. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script with a minor potential issue in the file reading syntax. No malicious behavior or malware indications are detected. It functions to configure packaging without security risks.",
