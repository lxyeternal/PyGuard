    "Glob pattern used as 'tls_client/dependencies/' with trailing slash but then used as 'directory + *' which may not correctly list files if directory is empty or not properly formatted"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks: collecting metadata, files, and configuration. The use of exec() to read __version__.py poses a potential security risk if that file is compromised, as arbitrary code could be executed. The glob usage is standard but should be checked for correctness; however, it does not pose malicious intent by itself. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code does not handle untrusted input or perform unsafe operations beyond the exec() call, which is a known risk in such setup scripts. Overall, the code appears typical for a setup.py file, with a notable concern over the exec() usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a potential security concern stemming from executing code via exec() on the __version__.py file. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The overall risk is low, but the exec() usage should be reviewed for safety.",
