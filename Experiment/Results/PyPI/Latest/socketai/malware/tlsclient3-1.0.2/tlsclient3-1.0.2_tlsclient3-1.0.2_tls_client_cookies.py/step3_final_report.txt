{
  "purpose": "The code implements classes and functions for managing HTTP cookies, including cookie jars, mock request/response objects, and utilities for creating, removing, and merging cookies.",
  "sources": "Request headers, response headers, URL parsing, cookie creation functions",
  "sinks": "Cookie storage, cookie extraction, cookie deletion, cookie merging",
  "flows": "Extraction of cookies from response headers into cookie jar, setting/removing cookies, merging cookies from different sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard patterns used",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of cookie management with classes and functions typical for HTTP cookie handling. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The functions for creating, extracting, and managing cookies are straightforward and do not contain suspicious logic. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, reflecting minimal potential for misuse but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management classes and functions. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis. The overall security risk is negligible, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
