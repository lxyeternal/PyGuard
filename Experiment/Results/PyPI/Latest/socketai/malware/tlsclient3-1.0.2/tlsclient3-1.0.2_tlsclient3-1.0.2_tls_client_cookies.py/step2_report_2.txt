  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The report correctly identifies the code as cookie management, with standard sources and sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code. The code is a legitimate cookie handling library.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard cookie handling, with typical data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of mock classes appears benign.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is legitimate, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score of 0.2 is slightly above zero but still low, reflecting minimal concern. The malware score is zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard cookie management with typical functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious patterns. No obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same as above, standard cookie handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard cookie management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the analysis. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is justified; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in all reports, reflecting low but non-zero potential concern, perhaps due to the complexity of cookie handling code, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — low, given the nature of the code, but acknowledging that cookie handling can be sensitive if misused.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured cookie management library with no malicious or obfuscated components.",
