  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code manages cookies, extracting from response headers, request headers, and URLs—standard behavior.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookies are added or removed via typical methods; flow is straightforward.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. Uses standard libraries and patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate cookie management code, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0, Confidence = 1.0 — all consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar cookie handling functions and classes, including extraction from headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie creation, management, and extraction are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation. Uses mock classes for testing or compatibility.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious intent; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management, including a custom cookie jar, with extraction functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie creation, merging, deletion, and extraction are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses threading for compatibility, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie handling, extraction, and management functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard cookie operations; no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low-risk code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity detected; scores fit.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Cookie management, extraction, merging, and setting.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Typical cookie operations, no external malicious impact.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The pattern remains standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 (0.2) in some reports, reflecting minimal concern due to the complexity of cookie handling, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of cookie management for HTTP interactions.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- The scores are consistent and justified based on the code content.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n**Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, due to the potential for misuse if misconfigured, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the code's nature. No adjustments necessary.",
