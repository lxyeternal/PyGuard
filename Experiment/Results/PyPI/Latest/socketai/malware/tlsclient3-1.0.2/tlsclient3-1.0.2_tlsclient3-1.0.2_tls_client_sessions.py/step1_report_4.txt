  "purpose": "This code implements a custom HTTP session class for making web requests with advanced TLS and request configuration options, including managing cookies, headers, proxies, and secure connection settings.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-supplied parameters (headers, cookies, data, json, proxies, etc.), environment variables indirectly via defaults, and network responses.",
  "sinks": "Data flows include network requests via the 'request' function, memory deallocation via 'freeMemory', and response handling through 'build_response'. Potential sensitive sinks involve request construction, memory management, and cookie handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through request preparation, encoding, and configuration into the 'request' call, then response is processed, memory freed, and response returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Use of external C functions for request and memory management is standard for FFI integration but warrants careful validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected in request handling, cookie processing, or response parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive HTTP session class with customizable TLS, proxy, headers, cookies, and request settings. It uses CFFI functions ('request', 'freeMemory', 'destroySession') for network and memory operations, which are typical in performance-critical or security-sensitive applications. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The memory is correctly managed via 'freeMemory' after response processing. No evidence of data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious backdoors is found. The design appears intended for secure and flexible web requests rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured HTTP client class with advanced configuration options, employing external C functions for performance or security reasons. There is no indication of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attack vectors within this module. The use of FFI functions should be verified in its deployment context to ensure they do not introduce security risks, but based solely on this code, it is benign.",
