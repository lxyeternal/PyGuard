  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, advanced HTTP client with extensive configuration options. It relies on external native libraries, which introduces a supply chain risk, but no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident within this code fragment. The primary concern is verifying the trustworthiness of the external libraries. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0; the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3) due to external dependencies."
