  "purpose": "A highly configurable Python HTTP client supporting advanced TLS, HTTP/2, cookie management, and native memory handling via ctypes.",
  "sources": "External C functions invoked through ctypes: request, freeMemory, destroySession",
  "sinks": "Network requests, native memory deallocation, response handling",
  "flows": "Native functions (request, destroySession, freeMemory) interact with external libraries; data flows from request payloads to native code and back",
  "anomalies": "Use of ctypes for native library calls; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code interfaces with external native libraries via ctypes for request handling and session destruction, which is typical in high-performance or security-sensitive libraries. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The native functions could be exploited if the external libraries are compromised, but the code itself appears legitimate. The extensive TLS and HTTP/2 configuration options indicate a sophisticated client, not malicious. The native memory management is standard for FFI but warrants trust in the external libraries. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, advanced HTTP client with extensive configuration options. It relies on external native libraries, which introduces a supply chain risk, but no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident within this code fragment. The primary concern is verifying the trustworthiness of the external libraries. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0; the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3) due to external dependencies.",
