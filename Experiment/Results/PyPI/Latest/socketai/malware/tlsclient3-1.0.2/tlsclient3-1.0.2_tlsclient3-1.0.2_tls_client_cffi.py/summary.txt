  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, platform-specific loader for a native library, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security risk stems from trusting the external library without validation. Implementing checksum or signature verification would mitigate this risk. The malware score remains 0, and the risk score around 0.3 is appropriate given the context."
