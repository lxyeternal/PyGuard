  "purpose": "Platform-dependent loader for the 'tls-client' shared library, exposing functions 'request', 'freeMemory', and 'destroySession'.",
  "sources": "Reads system platform, architecture, and file path for library loading.",
  "sinks": "Loads external shared library without validation; calls functions within the library.",
  "flows": "Determines platform/architecture -> constructs filename -> loads library -> exposes functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code; external library is unverified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward cross-platform loader that dynamically loads a native library based on system info. It exposes three functions with specified argument and return types. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'tls-client' library, which is loaded without integrity verification. The code itself is benign and standard for such purposes. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The risk score, set around 0.3, reflects reliance on external code without validation, which could be a supply chain vector if compromised. The obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the straightforward implementation. Overall, the code's security posture depends on external library integrity, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, platform-specific loader for a native library, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security risk stems from trusting the external library without validation. Implementing checksum or signature verification would mitigate this risk. The malware score remains 0, and the risk score around 0.3 is appropriate given the context.",
