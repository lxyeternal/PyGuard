  "purpose": "Load a platform-specific shared library for TLS client operations and expose functions for requesting, freeing memory, and destroying sessions.",
  "sources": "Reads the current platform, machine architecture, and the __file__ path to determine library location and type.",
  "sinks": "Loads shared library and accesses functions request, freeMemory, destroySession, which could potentially handle untrusted input if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Platform detection -> Dynamic library path construction -> Library loading -> Exposing functions for further use",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code dynamically loads a shared library based on platform info without validation or checks for the library's origin. No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The script determines the platform and architecture to select an appropriate shared library file. It constructs the path relative to the script location and loads the library using ctypes. Functions from the library are exposed with specified argument and return types. The code performs platform-specific handling and dynamic loading, which is standard but relies on external, potentially unverified shared libraries. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident within this code fragment, but if the shared library or its functions are malicious, the script could be misused. Overall, the code itself is a standard platform-dependent loader without inherent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate platform-specific loader for shared libraries related to TLS client operations. There are no obvious signs of malicious behavior or sabotage within this fragment. However, the security depends on the integrity and origin of the shared library loaded at runtime. No evidence of malware or malicious intent detected.",
