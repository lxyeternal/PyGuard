{
  "purpose": "Defines a Response class for handling HTTP responses and a function to build such responses from data structures.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'res' dictionary in build_response function and from class properties such as 'text' and 'headers'.",
  "sinks": "Uses json.loads on self.text, encoding self.text to bytes, and assigns data directly to response attributes.",
  "flows": "build_response receives data from input parameters, assigns to Response object properties, and encodes text to bytes for _content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual control flows observed. Use of json.loads is standard; no unsafe eval or exec detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a Response class with methods to access HTTP response data, and a builder function to create Response objects from input dicts. No dynamic code execution, no external network or system calls, and no hardcoded credentials are present. The functions process data in a straightforward manner, with standard JSON parsing and attribute assignments. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard HTTP response handler with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely processes and constructs response objects from provided data without suspicious operations.",
