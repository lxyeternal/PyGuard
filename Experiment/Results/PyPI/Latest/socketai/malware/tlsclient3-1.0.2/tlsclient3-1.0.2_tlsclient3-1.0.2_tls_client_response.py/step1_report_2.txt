{
  "purpose": "Define a Response class to model HTTP responses and a builder function to create Response objects from dictionaries and cookies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'res' dictionary for target URL, status, headers, and body; reading cookie data from 'res_cookies'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or system resources.",
  "flows": "Input 'res' and 'res_cookies' flow into constructing the Response object, setting properties such as url, status_code, headers, cookies, text, and _content.",
  "anomalies": "The Response class's 'content' property references '_content_consumed' without initialization, potentially causing an AttributeError. The code doesn't handle the case where 'res['headers']' is None gracefully in all parts but checks for it. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily straightforward: it defines a data model for HTTP responses and a builder function. There is a potential bug with '_content_consumed' attribute used in 'content' property but never initialized in __init__, which could lead to runtime errors but not malicious behavior. No code injection, network activity, or malicious payloads are evident. The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious operations such as data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious network communication. Usage of imported modules is standard and safe. Overall, the code appears to serve a typical purpose of modeling HTTP responses and is free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP response model with a builder function. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. A minor bug exists with '_content_consumed' attribute, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not pose security risks.",
