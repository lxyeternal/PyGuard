{
  "purpose": "Defines an HTTP response object and a builder function to construct it from given data, likely used in an HTTP client or testing environment.",
  "sources": "Input data from dictionaries (res parameter in build_response) and cookie jar creation.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() on response text, which could execute malicious JSON if the source is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Response text is directly parsed by json.loads() without validation, but no other data flow or external command execution is present.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious function calls, no obfuscated code. No network operations or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an HTTP response object, setting properties like URL, status code, headers, cookies, and body. The json() method parses the response body as JSON, which is standard. The build_response() function populates the Response object from provided dictionaries and cookie jars. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The only consideration is that the json() method could process malicious JSON if the response text is untrusted, but this is typical in JSON handling. No dynamic code execution or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an HTTP response wrapper with a builder function, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It handles data structures safely and performs standard operations without any harmful side effects.",
