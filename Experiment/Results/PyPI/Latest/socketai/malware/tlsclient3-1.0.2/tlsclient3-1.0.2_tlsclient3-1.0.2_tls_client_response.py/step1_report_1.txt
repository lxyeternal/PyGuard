{
  "purpose": "Defines a Response class and a helper function to build Response objects from given data, primarily for handling HTTP responses.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'res' dictionary in build_response, and from the Response class attributes such as 'text' and 'headers'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is directly written to sensitive system areas, nor is there network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'res' dictionary into Response object attributes; no external or untrusted data flow to system or network functions is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of json.loads on 'self.text' could be risky if 'text' contains malicious JSON, but this is standard JSON parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Response class with methods to handle HTTP response data, including parsing JSON content and managing response content. The build_response function constructs a Response object from provided data, including setting URL, headers, cookies, status code, and body. No external data is written to system files or network. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior such as executing untrusted code, network connections, or data exfiltration. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs. It appears to be a standard, benign implementation for handling HTTP responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a utility for processing HTTP responses and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
