  "purpose": "Define a Response class for handling HTTP responses and a builder function for creating Response objects from dictionaries and cookies.",
  "sources": "Reading response data from dictionaries (res), headers, body text, and cookies (res_cookies).",
  "sinks": "json.loads on self.text, potential for exceptions if self.text is malicious or malformed; encoding of response.body to bytes.",
  "flows": "res['body']' -> response.text -> response._content -> response.content property; res['headers']' -> response.headers; res['target'], res['status']' -> response attributes; res_cookies -> response.cookies.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code; usage of json.loads assumes well-formed JSON; no unsafe code execution or external system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Response class to encapsulate HTTP response data, with methods for JSON parsing and content handling. The build_response function constructs a Response object from provided data, populating headers, cookies, and body content. The JSON parsing via json.loads is standard and safe given the context; no unsafe or malicious patterns are present. The code relies on external data structures and does not process untrusted input directly, limiting risk. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, straightforward implementation of an HTTP response handler and builder function. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious anomalies. It is safe within its context.",
