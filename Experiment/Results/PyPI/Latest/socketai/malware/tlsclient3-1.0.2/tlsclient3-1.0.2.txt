      "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with minor security considerations due to the use of exec() for loading version info. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Syntax errors are bugs, not malicious. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a slight risk score (~0.2) primarily due to exec()."

The primary security risk stems from trusting the external library without validation. Implementing checksum or signature verification would mitigate this risk. The malware score remains 0, and the risk score around 0.3 is appropriate given the context."
