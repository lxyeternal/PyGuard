  "purpose": "Detects and analyzes obfuscated malicious code involving dynamic execution and obfuscation techniques.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded string decoded and XOR processed; metadata variables; sleep delay.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded payload; potential for arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Base64 string -> XOR decoding -> exec() on decoded code.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with base64 and XOR; use of exec() on decoded payload; sleep delay.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a large, obfuscated base64 string that is decoded and executed via exec(). It employs XOR obfuscation and delays execution with sleep, indicating malicious intent. The metadata appears benign but is likely a cover. The heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and delay are classic malware indicators. Scores of malware and obfuscation are justified at 1, with a high security risk (~0.9). The pattern suggests a backdoor or malicious payload hidden within the obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious and likely malicious due to heavy obfuscation, dynamic execution, and delay tactics. It should be flagged and avoided. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified based on the observed techniques.",
