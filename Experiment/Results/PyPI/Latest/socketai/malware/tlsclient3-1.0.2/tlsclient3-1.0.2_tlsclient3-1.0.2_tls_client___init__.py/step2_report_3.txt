  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippets, their context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as consisting solely of comments and a single import statement.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or network activity is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The comments reference external projects and give credit, which is standard practice.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior:**\n   - The code is just comments and an import statement (`from .sessions import Session`).\n   - No input sources, data sinks, or data flows are observable.\n   - No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.\n   - The import appears to be standard, referencing a local module, likely for session management.\n\n2. **Potential Risks & Anomalies:**\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n   - No network operations or data handling shown.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - Malware score: 0 in all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n   - Security risk: 0, given the lack of executable or sensitive operations.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis of Each Report:\n\n- **Reports 1-5** all consistently describe the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty based on the minimal code.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound, given the limited code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Scores:** The current scores are appropriate and reasonable.\n- **Potential Adjustments:** None needed, as the evidence supports the current scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code snippet is harmless, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, well-documented module import with no malicious or suspicious features. The current scoring accurately reflects its safety profile.",
