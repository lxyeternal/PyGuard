  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a module import statement, likely part of a larger project, with comments referencing external projects for attribution and context.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .sessions import Session' reads from a local module; comments are static documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; the code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; comments are standard and the import is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single import statement, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The comments attribute external projects and do not contain secrets or obfuscation. The import is from a local module, typical for session management. No signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious patterns are present. The high confidence scores (close to 1) reflect the benign and straightforward nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
