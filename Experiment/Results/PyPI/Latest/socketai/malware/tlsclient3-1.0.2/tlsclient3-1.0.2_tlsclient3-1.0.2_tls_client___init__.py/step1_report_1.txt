  "purpose": "Module to import and likely utilize a custom Session class for HTTP interactions, inspired by requests and tls-client.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mainly comments and an import statement, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only header comments and a single import statement. Comments reference external projects and acknowledge inspirations, with no indication of malicious intent. The import of a Session class from a local module suggests standard functionality for managing HTTP sessions. There are no active data inputs, sinks, or flows that could be exploited. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless module setup with descriptive comments and an import statement. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a typical part of a larger codebase.",
