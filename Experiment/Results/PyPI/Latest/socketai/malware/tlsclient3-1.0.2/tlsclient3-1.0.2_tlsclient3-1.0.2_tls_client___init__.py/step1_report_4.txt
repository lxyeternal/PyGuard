  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header or documentation for a Python module related to HTTPS/TLS client sessions, likely part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .sessions import Session",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow is present in the provided code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is mostly comments and an import statement",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments and an import statement, with no executable logic. The comments provide attribution and links but do not include any suspicious or malicious code. The import suggests usage of a 'Session' class from a local module, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or data handling are present here. Since this is a partial snippet, the overall context is limited, but nothing suspicious is observable in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, consisting mainly of comments and a single import statement. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this fragment.",
