  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation command that executes a post-installation script.",
  "sources": "The code reads a file named 'post_install.py' from the same directory during the custom install command execution.",
  "sinks": "Executing the contents of 'post_install.py' via exec(), which can run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method reads and executes 'post_install.py', creating a source-to-sink flow from file read to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run an external script is a high-risk pattern; the script's content is not sanitized or verified before execution. The script is dynamically loaded and executed during install, which can be malicious if the file is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, upon execution, searches for 'post_install.py' in the package directory. If found, it reads and executes the script via exec(), which is inherently dangerous because it can run arbitrary code. The script is optional, but if present, it can contain malicious code. The code does not perform any validation or sandboxing on the script content. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious behavior or backdoors, especially if the script is injected or altered by an attacker. No other malicious behavior or suspicious library usage is present. The code structure itself appears typical for setup scripts, but the execution of external scripts with exec() is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially dangerous pattern of executing external scripts during installation without validation, which could allow malicious code execution if 'post_install.py' is malicious or tampered with. This behavior should be considered a security risk, especially in supply chain contexts.",
