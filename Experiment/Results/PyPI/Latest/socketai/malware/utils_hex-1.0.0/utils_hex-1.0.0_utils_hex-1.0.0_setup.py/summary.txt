  "conclusion": "The code pattern presents a significant security risk by executing external scripts during package installation without validation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the script is malicious. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the high malware and risk scores are justified. To improve security, this pattern should be replaced with safer mechanisms, such as validated scripts or explicit user consent."
