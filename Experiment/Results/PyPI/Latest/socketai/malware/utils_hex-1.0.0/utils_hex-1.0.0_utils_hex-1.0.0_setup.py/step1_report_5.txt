  "purpose": "Define and install a Python package named 'utils_hex' with a custom installation command that executes a post-installation script if present.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists, open, exec",
  "sinks": "exec(open(script_path).read())",
  "flows": "CustomInstallCommand.run() -> exec(open(script_path).read())",
  "anomalies": "Execution of external script 'post_install.py' during installation without verification, use of exec() on file contents.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom install command that runs a script named 'post_install.py' if it exists. The script path is constructed based on the current directory. If the script exists, it is executed directly with exec(). This approach allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, which can be malicious if the 'post_install.py' file is malicious or tampered with. The code does not validate or sandbox the script, leading to a potential security risk. No other suspicious behaviors like hardcoded credentials or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's core behavior of executing an external post-install script during package installation is risky, especially since there is no validation or restrictions on the script's content. This could be exploited to run malicious code on user systems. However, the code itself does not contain malicious logic—its security risk depends on the content of 'post_install.py'. Overall, it presents a security concern due to executing external scripts during setup.",
