{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'utils_hex', including a custom install command that executes an additional script after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filesystem to locate 'post_install.py' and executes its content.",
  "sinks": "The 'exec' function executes the contents of 'post_install.py', which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "The script path is constructed and checked; if exists, its content is read and executed via 'exec', creating a source-to-sink flow that runs arbitrary code if present.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'exec' on an external script is potentially dangerous, as it can execute malicious code if the script is compromised or maliciously replaced. No input validation or security checks are performed on the script content.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a package installation with a custom command that, upon execution, attempts to locate 'post_install.py' in the same directory. If found, it prints a message and executes its content directly using 'exec', which can run any arbitrary Python code. This behavior is a common technique for post-installation configuration but poses significant security risks if the script is malicious or altered. There are no safeguards, sandboxing, or validation steps for the external script. The rest of the code is standard setup configuration with no suspicious dependencies or obfuscated parts.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially dangerous pattern by executing an external script during installation without validation. This behavior could be exploited to run malicious code if 'post_install.py' is compromised or maliciously replaced. The rest of the code appears benign and standard.",
