  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that executes a post-installation script if present.",
  "sources": "The code reads the file 'post_install.py' from the current directory during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the contents of 'post_install.py' via exec() potentially executes arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code checks for 'post_install.py' and executes its content if found.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run external script contents is suspicious, as it can execute arbitrary code. The script is dynamically read from the filesystem during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that, after running the standard install process, looks for 'post_install.py' in the same directory. If the script exists, it executes its contents using exec(), which can run any arbitrary code contained within. This pattern can be exploited to insert malicious code into the package, especially if 'post_install.py' is tampered with. The setup configuration appears standard, but the dynamic execution of an external script during installation raises security concerns. No hardcoded secrets or other malicious behaviors are evident. The use of print statements in French is benign but does not mitigate the risk associated with exec().",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a potentially malicious pattern by executing external code via exec() during package installation. While it may be intended for legitimate post-installation tasks, this approach is risky and can be exploited for malicious purposes. The overall security risk is high due to this pattern.",
