{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not read from files, network, or environment variables directly.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from source to sink are observed; the code mainly performs internal computations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a clean, well-structured Python script performing basic operations without external input handling, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No signs of code injection, malicious data handling, or covert channels are detected. The absence of network activity or environment variable manipulation further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
