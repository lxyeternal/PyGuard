  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on static features such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious data flows.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, system info, network functions, subprocess calls, user inputs, external modules, and potentially untrusted inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, code execution points (`exec`, `eval`), file operations, environment variable access, subprocess invocations.",
  "flows": "Untrusted sources (environment variables, user inputs, network data) to sinks like code execution, network transmission, or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of `exec`/`eval`, obfuscated variable names, complex control flow, lack of comments, dynamic code execution, and absence of documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious features such as dynamic code execution (`exec`, `eval`) and obfuscation in reports 2 and 3, indicating potential malicious intent. Reports 1, 4, and 5 show straightforward, benign code with no suspicious patterns. The obfuscation scores in reports 2 and 3 are justified by the obfuscated variables and complex control flow. Malware scores reflect suspicion but lack confirmed malicious payloads, leading to moderate scores. Security risks are aligned with the suspicion levels, higher in reports 2 and 3 due to dynamic features. Confidence levels are high where no suspicious features are present and moderate where obfuscation and dynamic execution are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Static analysis indicates some reports contain obfuscated code and dynamic execution features, raising suspicion but no concrete malicious payloads are identified. The scores assigned are consistent with the evidence. Further dynamic or runtime testing is recommended to confirm malicious intent, especially for reports 2 and 3.",
