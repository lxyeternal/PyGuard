  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some kind of data processing or utility function within a larger application. No explicit malicious intent is evident from the visible code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or external modules, and possibly from network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions such as printing, logging, writing to files, or network transmission, especially if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, function inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs, network).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. No hidden backdoors or malicious code snippets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including initial, middle, and final segments. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious API calls, were found. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent were detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems legitimate and does not contain indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
