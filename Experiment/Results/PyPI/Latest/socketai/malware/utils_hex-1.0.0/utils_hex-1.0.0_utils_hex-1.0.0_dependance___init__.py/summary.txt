  "conclusion": "Static analysis indicates some reports contain obfuscated code and dynamic execution features, raising suspicion but no concrete malicious payloads are identified. The scores assigned are consistent with the evidence. Further dynamic or runtime testing is recommended to confirm malicious intent, especially for reports 2 and 3."
