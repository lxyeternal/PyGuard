      "conclusion": "The code pattern presents a significant security risk by executing external scripts during package installation without validation. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the script is malicious. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the high malware and risk scores are justified. To improve security, this pattern should be replaced with safer mechanisms, such as validated scripts or explicit user consent."

      "conclusion": "Static analysis indicates some reports contain obfuscated code and dynamic execution features, raising suspicion but no concrete malicious payloads are identified. The scores assigned are consistent with the evidence. Further dynamic or runtime testing is recommended to confirm malicious intent, especially for reports 2 and 3."
