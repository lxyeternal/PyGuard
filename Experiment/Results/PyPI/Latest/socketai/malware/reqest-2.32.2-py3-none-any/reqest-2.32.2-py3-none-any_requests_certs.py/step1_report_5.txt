{
  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, based on certifi.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'where' function from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the CA bundle location via print().",
  "flows": "Imports certifi.where() -> prints the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and primarily informational.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted library (certifi) to retrieve the path to CA certificates and prints this path when executed as a script. No untrusted input, no data leaks, no suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears to serve a documentation or utility purpose related to SSL certificate management. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a simple utility function to display the certifi CA bundle path. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
