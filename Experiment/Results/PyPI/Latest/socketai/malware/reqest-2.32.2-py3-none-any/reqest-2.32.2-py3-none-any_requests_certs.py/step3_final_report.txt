{
  "purpose": "Outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from 'certifi' and calling it when run as main.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only prints a trusted file path, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> call 'where()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward utility code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from 'certifi' and prints its output when executed. It performs a simple, benign task without user input, network activity, or data leaks. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned by all reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that retrieves and displays the trusted CA bundle path. There are no security concerns, malicious intent, or obfuscation. All reports accurately assess the code as safe, and the scoring is appropriate.",
