  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The line 'from certifi import where' which imports the certificate bundle location function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the certificate bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "Source: Import 'where' from certifi -> Function call 'where()' -> Output to stdout via print().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, which provides the path to the trusted CA bundle. When executed as a script, it prints this path. The code's purpose is to provide a consistent way to locate the CA bundle, useful in packaging or deployment contexts. No untrusted input, no data leaks, no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign utility script that outputs the certifi CA bundle path. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
