  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function retrieves the CA bundle path, which is then printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and standard for certificate bundle retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The script simply imports a function from a well-known library (certifi) and prints its output. The code has no user input, no network connections, no data processing beyond fetching a file path, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The purpose is to display the location of the trusted CA bundle, which is common in security-related scripts. There are no signs of malware, malicious data flows, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign script that outputs the default CA certificate bundle location from certifi. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
