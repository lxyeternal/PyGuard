  "purpose": "This code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The printed output of the CA bundle path; no untrusted data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> print(where()) if run as main -> outputs CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of certifi to locate CA bundle. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted library (certifi) and outputs the path to the CA bundle. It does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or code execution. The structure is straightforward, serving a simple utility purpose without any obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility script to output the default CA certificate bundle path used by requests. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
