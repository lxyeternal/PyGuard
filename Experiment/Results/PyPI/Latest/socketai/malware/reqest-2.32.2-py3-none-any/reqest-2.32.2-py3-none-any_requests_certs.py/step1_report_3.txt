{
  "purpose": "The script outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package, invoked in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The output is printed to standard output, which could be captured by other processes but poses no inherent security risk.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function provides the path to the CA bundle, which is printed directly. No untrusted data is involved or propagated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of a trusted library function to output a static, well-known path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library (certifi) and calls its 'where' function to print the path to the CA bundle. It contains no user input, no data processing, and no suspicious code behavior. The script's purpose is to identify the CA bundle location, commonly used for SSL verification. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external data sources, and no malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply outputs a trusted CA bundle path. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
