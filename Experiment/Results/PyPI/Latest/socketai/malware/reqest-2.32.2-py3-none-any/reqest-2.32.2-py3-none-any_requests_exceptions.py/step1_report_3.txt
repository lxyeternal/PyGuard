{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling various errors in the Requests library, including network, JSON decoding, and HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, import statements, and initializations for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; the code does not process input data or output data directly. It only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely defining classes and does not handle external data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard exception inheritance and imports. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various exception classes for the Requests library, with detailed docstrings and inheritance. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The import statements are standard, and the class implementations are typical. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated parts are present. The purpose appears solely to structure error handling for the library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling within the Requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. The overall security assessment is that it is benign.",
