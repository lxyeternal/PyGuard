  "purpose": "Defines various exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library, including network, JSON, SSL, and URL errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and local compat module for JSONDecodeError.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is being processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code is standard exception class definitions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, with no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The import statements are standard. The classes inherit from built-in exceptions or other library exceptions without modifying or injecting any malicious behavior. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or covert channels. The structure is typical for a Python exception module, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
