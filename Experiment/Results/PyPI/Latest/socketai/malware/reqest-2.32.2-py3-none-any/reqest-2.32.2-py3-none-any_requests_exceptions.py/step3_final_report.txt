  "purpose": "Defines and handles exceptions for the Requests library, including network and JSON errors.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions with response/request attributes.",
  "sinks": "Attribute access on response objects, typical for error classes.",
  "flows": "Attribute access, no external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions for network and JSON errors, with typical inheritance and attribute handling. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted data occurs. The __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError ensures proper pickling. The structure and content are straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The exception classes serve error handling purposes only and do not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The attribute access on response objects is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The import statements and class inheritance are standard and do not introduce vulnerabilities.",
