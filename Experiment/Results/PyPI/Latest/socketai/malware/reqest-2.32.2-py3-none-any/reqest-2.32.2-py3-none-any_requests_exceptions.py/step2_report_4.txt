  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the code's security implications step-by-step.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- All reports consistently identify that the code only defines error classes, imports, and standard inheritance.\n- No evidence of dynamic code execution, data processing, network activity, or handling of untrusted input.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- The attribute access on response/request objects is typical for error handling in such libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Data leaks or external outputs:** No data flows or leaks are evident.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0. The code's purpose is purely exception handling, with no security risks.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling.\n- The exception classes are standard and serve as a framework for error handling.\n- No suspicious attribute access or data leaks are evident.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is safe, straightforward, and has no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
