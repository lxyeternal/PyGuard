  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The attribute access on response objects is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The import statements and class inheritance are standard and do not introduce vulnerabilities."
