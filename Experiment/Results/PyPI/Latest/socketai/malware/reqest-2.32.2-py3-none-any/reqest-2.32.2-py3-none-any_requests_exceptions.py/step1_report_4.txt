{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the requests library to handle various HTTP and connection errors, warnings, and specific error cases.",
  "sources": "Import statements from urllib3.exceptions and .compat, class definitions, __init__ methods, __reduce__ methods, and warning classes.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; exception classes are for error handling only.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; exception handling logic is standard and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes to represent various request and connection errors. It imports dependencies and establishes class inheritance without executing or processing untrusted data. The __init__ and __reduce__ methods are standard for exception classes, and no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. The warning classes are also standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of exception handling classes for the requests library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be safe and intentionally designed for error handling in HTTP requests.",
