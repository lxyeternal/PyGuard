{
  "purpose": "Define and handle exceptions for the Requests library, including network errors, JSON decoding issues, and warnings.",
  "sources": "Exception classes and their initializations, especially where response/request objects are used or modified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include attribute access on response objects (e.g., response.request), which could leak request data; no other data flows or external outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Initialization of exceptions involving response/request objects, with potential attribute access; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; use of inheritance and exception handling appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of exception classes for the requests library, primarily for handling network and JSON errors. The constructors involve typical attribute handling, including optional response and request objects. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious network communication, or backdoor logic. The code uses inheritance and standard Python features without obfuscation or malicious intent. The only notable behavior is attribute access on response objects, which is typical for such error classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for a network request library with no malicious behavior detected. It performs standard error handling without any suspicious side-effects or security risks.",
