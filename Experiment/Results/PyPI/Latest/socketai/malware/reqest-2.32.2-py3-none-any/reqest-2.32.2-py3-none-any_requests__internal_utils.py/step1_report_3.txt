  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use by the Requests library, including regex validation for headers and string encoding/decoding helpers.",
  "sources": "Imports from re, .compat, and input parameters to functions (string, encoding, u_string).",
  "sinks": "None present; functions perform data transformations and validations only.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through decoding and validation functions, but no external or untrusted sources are explicitly read or used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. Regex patterns are standard for header validation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string handling and regex validation for headers. No data is read from external sources or network, and no untrusted input is processed in a harmful manner. Functions operate on passed-in data, with straightforward logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no malicious intent, no suspicious activity, and no security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate library for HTTP request handling.",
