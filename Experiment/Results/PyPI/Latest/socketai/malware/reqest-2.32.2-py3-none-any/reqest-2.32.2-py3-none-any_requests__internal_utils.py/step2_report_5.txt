  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code contains utility functions for string handling (`to_native_string`, `unicode_is_ascii`) and regex-based header validation.\n- No external data sources or network operations are involved.\n- Regex patterns are straightforward, designed for header validation.\n- Functions process input strings to ensure they are ASCII or convert them to native strings.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code operates purely as a utility module within the Requests library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of malicious or security-impacting issues:** None. The code is standard utility functions.\n- **Vulnerabilities or exploits:** None detected.\n- **Data leaks or external data flows:** No, functions process passed-in data only.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious patterns:** No, code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The code appears correct and well-structured for its purpose.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The regex patterns are appropriate for header validation.\n\n### Score Review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n- Given the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0), which is justified.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious behavior or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — No vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The functions are utility helpers; they do not process untrusted data in a harmful way.\n- Regex patterns are standard and safe.\n- The functions are common in HTTP header validation and string handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the code and reports, **all scores are appropriate**. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's nature and purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign utility module with no security issues. The scores assigned are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
