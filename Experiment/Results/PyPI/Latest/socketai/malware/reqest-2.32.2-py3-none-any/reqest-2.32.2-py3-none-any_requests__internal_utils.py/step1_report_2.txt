{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use by the Requests library to validate headers and handle string encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "Input is received through function parameters: 'string' and 'u_string'. The code also imports 're' and 'compat' modules, but does not read external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within functions; no data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are checked or transformed internally; no external data flows or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The regex patterns are straightforward and for validation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation, which are standard for HTTP headers. Functions 'to_native_string' and 'unicode_is_ascii' handle string conversions and checks with no external effects. No malicious behaviors or data leaks are evident. The code appears to serve a utility purpose, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for header validation and string handling with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and typical for its purpose.",
