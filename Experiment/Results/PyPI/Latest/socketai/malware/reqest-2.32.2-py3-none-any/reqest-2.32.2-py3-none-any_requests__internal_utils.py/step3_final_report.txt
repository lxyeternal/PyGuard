  "purpose": "Utility functions for header validation, string conversion, and ASCII checks within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (strings passed to to_native_string and unicode_is_ascii).",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate on passed-in data without external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input strings are decoded or validated within the functions; no external data flow or malicious data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; regex patterns are standard, functions are straightforward, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for string handling and header validation, using regex patterns and simple encoding checks. No external data sources, network activity, or data sinks are involved. Regex patterns are typical for header validation. Functions perform decoding and ASCII validation safely. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for string validation and conversion, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
