  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python library, including descriptive information and stylistic ASCII art.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package info (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network calls, or external data handling present",
  "flows": "None; static metadata without data flow or external interactions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments providing package metadata. No functions, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Confidence is high (1.0) due to the static and transparent nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata file with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
