  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading constant string variables assigned directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "None, as all data are static constant assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; all variables are typical metadata declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments containing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, etc. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, no network operations, or any dynamic behavior. The content appears to be standard, legitimate metadata for the 'requests' package. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and only includes package metadata. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
