{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Constants and string literals assigned to metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, I/O, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks, as the code only defines static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements; the code is straightforward metadata assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of variable assignments of package metadata. It includes no input handling, no external data processing, and no dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The metadata appears standard for a Python package, with no secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple metadata declaration for the 'requests' package and shows no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
