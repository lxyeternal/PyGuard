  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments, such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not perform data output, network connections, or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static string assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code solely defines package metadata with no suspicious code behavior, input handling, or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of variable assignments establishing package metadata. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network calls, or obfuscated code. It does not contain any executable logic that could be malicious or suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define package metadata. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a standard, harmless metadata declaration for the 'requests' package.",
