{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other related information.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables are assigned string and numeric constants at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations are present, so there are no sinks related to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The ASCII art is a stylized banner but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments setting package metadata. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external calls. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are observed. The content appears to be standard for a Python package's __init__.py or metadata file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not include any malicious code, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.",
