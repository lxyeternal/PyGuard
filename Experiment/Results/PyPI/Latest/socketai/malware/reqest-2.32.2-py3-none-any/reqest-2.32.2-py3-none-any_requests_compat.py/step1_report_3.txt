{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and for importing various standard library components and third-party libraries used by other modules.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from sys, attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', tries to import 'simplejson', and imports standard libraries like collections, http, io, urllib.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not process untrusted input or data in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily handles imports and compatibility adjustments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code handles version detection, optional imports, and assigns compatibility variables without suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes compatibility layers for Python 2 and 3, detects urllib3 version, resolves character detection libraries, and imports modules with fallback options. It assigns variables to handle differences in Python versions and optional dependencies, all in a straightforward and standard manner. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data processing occurs that could indicate malicious activity. The code appears to be a typical compatibility shim with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import setup module for a larger project. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It does not handle untrusted input or perform operations that could compromise security.",
