  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the corresponding code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a compatibility layer handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- All reports agree that there are no malicious activities, suspicious behaviors, or security risks.\n- The code performs standard practices such as dynamic imports, version checks, and aliasing for cross-version compatibility.\n- No untrusted data processing, network communication, or data exfiltration is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code aligns with typical compatibility modules; the logic and import patterns are standard.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None; the code is limited to imports and version checks.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payload.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, readable, and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified, no untrusted data handling, no external communication.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reported scores seem appropriate; all are zero or near-zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are high, given the straightforwardness of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a typical compatibility shim used in many Python projects to handle differences between Python 2 and 3, as well as optional dependencies. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and contains no security concerns.",
