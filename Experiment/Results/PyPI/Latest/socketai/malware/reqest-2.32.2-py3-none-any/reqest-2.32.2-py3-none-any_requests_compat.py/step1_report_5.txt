{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling import differences, version checks, and library detection in Python, mainly for supporting older Python versions and ensuring correct library usage.",
  "sources": "Library imports (importlib, sys, urllib3, simplejson, json, collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request) and local function _resolve_char_detection.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or actions; no direct data leaks or unsafe operations detected.",
  "flows": "Imports and version checks influence module behavior; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code appears straightforward and compatible with Python environments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs version detection, optional library imports, and compatibility handling. It uses standard, well-understood libraries without any dynamic code execution, external data processing, or insecure patterns. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. All imports are standard for compatibility modules. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are found. The logic is simple, clear, and consistent with typical compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim with no malicious or suspicious elements. It facilitates library and version compatibility for Python 2 and 3 environments without any malicious intent or security risks.",
