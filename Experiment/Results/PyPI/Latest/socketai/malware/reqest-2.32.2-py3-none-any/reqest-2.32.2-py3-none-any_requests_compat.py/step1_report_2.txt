{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility utilities for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as imports for various URL and encoding related functions.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for dynamic import of character detection libraries; sys.version_info for Python version detection; standard library imports (json, collections, urllib, http, io).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical operations with user input are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; the code primarily performs version checks, dynamic imports, and library aliasing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code uses dynamic imports and compatibility handling in a typical manner.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by importing standard libraries and handling compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It dynamically detects the presence of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' libraries. It checks the urllib3 version and sets flags accordingly. It conditionally imports 'simplejson' if available, falling back to 'json'. It assigns standard types for compatibility, e.g., 'str' and 'bytes'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious data handling. The code appears to be a typical compatibility and utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and utility module for Python projects, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily handles imports and version compatibility without processing untrusted data or performing network operations.",
