  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely compatibility boilerplate, handling imports, version detection, and library resolution without any malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data handling, no external communication, no suspicious logic.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard compatibility handling, dynamic imports, and version checks.\n- **Findings:** No data flows from untrusted sources, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies this as benign compatibility code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, compatibility setup with no suspicious logic.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no data leaks, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Given the code is benign, this is slightly conservative but acceptable.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility and environment detection, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data processing, no suspicious code.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility layer, no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, no suspicious logic.\n- **Risk & Malware:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is standard compatibility boilerplate, with no malicious intent, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All risk and malware scores are appropriately low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature.\n- **Potential Concerns:** No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — the code does not introduce security risks.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a typical, safe compatibility module with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| 0          | 0            | 0      |\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings. No further action needed.",
