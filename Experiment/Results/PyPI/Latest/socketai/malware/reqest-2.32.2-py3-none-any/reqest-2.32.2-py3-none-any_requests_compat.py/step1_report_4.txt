{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing third-party libraries like urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, and simplejson if available.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from system information (sys.version_info), environment (importlib.import_module), and module imports (urllib3, simplejson, json).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities; all imports and variable assignments are standard and safe.",
  "flows": "The flow involves detecting the Python version, importing optional modules, and setting variables accordingly, with no untrusted data or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present. The code strictly handles imports, compatibility, and environment detection with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility and import setup module for handling differences between Python 2 and 3, and importing third-party libraries safely if available. It includes version detection, optional module imports, and defining compatibility variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code's structure and content align with common, safe practices for cross-version compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility layer with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard environment detection and module imports without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
