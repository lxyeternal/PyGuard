  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- No untrusted data is processed.\n- No network communication, data exfiltration, or external commands are present.\n- The code performs import resolution, version checks, and aliasing, which are common in such modules.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility functions, import handling.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, just imports and version detection.\n- Conclusion: Safe, boilerplate code.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility utilities, handling differences, optional imports.\n- Analysis: Standard practices, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, typical compatibility code.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility functions, library detection.\n- Analysis: No dynamic code execution, no untrusted data handling.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1 (slightly higher, but justified as minimal).\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score (0.1) due to the dynamic import detection, but justified since it's just environment detection, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility, library detection.\n- Analysis: No data leaks, no untrusted data, safe imports.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility, version handling.\n- Analysis: No suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Standard compatibility code.\n- **Scores:** malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, well-understood compatibility boilerplate.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The slight risk score (0.1) in report 3 is justified due to environment detection but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk beyond standard compatibility considerations)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard compatibility boilerplate with no security concerns.",
