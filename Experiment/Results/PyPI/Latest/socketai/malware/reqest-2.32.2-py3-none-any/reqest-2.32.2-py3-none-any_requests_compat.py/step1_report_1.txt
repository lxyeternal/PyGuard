{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and for importing specific libraries like 'chardet' and 'simplejson'.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version checks, and library resolution functions",
  "sinks": "No sinks found; no untrusted data handling or external communication is present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily performs imports and version checks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; straightforward compatibility code",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules conditionally, detects library versions, and defines compatibility aliases. No untrusted input is processed, and no external communication occurs. The dynamic import resolution for 'chardet' and 'simplejson' is standard practice. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as network requests, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely compatibility boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs safe import and version detection tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
