  "purpose": "Compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, handling import resolution, version detection, and optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version info, dynamic import attempts for 'chardet' and 'simplejson', environment detection functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, external communication, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Import and version detection logic, optional library resolution, environment checks; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard compatibility boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, involving import resolution, version detection, and optional dependencies. It performs no network activity, data handling, or malicious operations. The dynamic import logic and version checks are standard practices. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or revision is necessary.",
