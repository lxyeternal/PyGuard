{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and simple lookup dictionaries used in requests handling.",
  "sources": "Input data through constructor (__init__), and data modification via __setitem__, update, and get methods.",
  "sinks": "Accessing dictionary items through __getitem__, get methods, and iteration over stored items.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into __init__ and update; data is stored in internal _store or __dict__; retrievals occur via __getitem__, get, or iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no external network calls, and no unusual or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard Python features and collections.",
  "analysis": "The classes implement standard dictionary-like behaviors with case insensitivity in key handling (CaseInsensitiveDict) and a simple lookup dictionary (LookupDict). The code uses standard library collections and simple methods. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The __repr__ methods provide string representations, which is typical. There are no obfuscated elements or suspicious code patterns. The logic is straightforward, focusing on case-insensitive key management and simple attribute-based lookups.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of the Requests library, providing utility data structures without any malicious intent or security risks. No malicious behavior or security threats are detected.",
