  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization of dictionaries, setting and getting items, update methods, and constructor inputs.",
  "sinks": "Dictionary item access, __getitem__, and __repr__ methods.",
  "flows": "Input data to dictionary methods, then to item access and representation.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behaviors; it implements standard data structures without any hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict, which are standard implementations of dictionary-like structures. The first manages case-insensitive keys for HTTP headers, using lowercase internal storage while preserving original case. The second is a simple dictionary with a name attribute for lookup purposes. No external data is fetched or sent, and no code injection, network activity, or system modifications are present. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No obfuscated or suspicious logic was detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries used in HTTP request handling. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
