  "purpose": "Provides utilities for cookie management, extraction, and compatibility within the requests library, including cookie jar handling, cookie creation, and extraction from responses.",
  "sources": "Request URL, request headers, response headers, cookie parameters, and request/response objects.",
  "sinks": "CookieJar objects, request headers, response headers, and internal cookie storage.",
  "flows": "Request/response headers and objects flow into cookie extraction, creation, and management functions; cookies are stored, retrieved, and headers are generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious external calls, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard threading locks and exception handling are used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cookie management tasks: extracting cookies from responses, creating cookies, managing cookie jars, and generating cookie headers. No external network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. Thread safety measures are standard. The functions and classes are straightforward, well-structured, and align with typical cookie handling implementations. No signs of sabotage, data leaks, or covert channels are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1) accurately reflects the utility nature of the code with no evident vulnerabilities.",
