  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Reads from request objects (request.url, request.headers), response objects (response._original_response.msg), and cookie dictionaries (cookie_dict).",
  "sinks": "Generates Cookie headers (get_cookie_header), manipulates cookies via set and remove methods, and potentially updates or copies cookie jars.",
  "flows": "Extracts cookies from responses to store in cookie jars; retrieves cookies from jars to generate Cookie headers for requests; allows modification and merging of cookie data.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward with no obfuscated language features; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious variable naming; functions for cookie manipulation are standard and do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mechanisms to handle cookies in the context of HTTP requests. It wraps request and response objects for compatibility, extracts cookies from responses, and manages cookies via a CookieJar subclass. No malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is detected. The functions are typical for cookie handling, with no indicators of sabotage or privacy violations. The code appears to be well-structured and consistent with standard cookie management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard utility for cookie handling within the requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly manages cookies, supports cookie jar operations, and maintains compatibility without performing any suspicious actions.",
