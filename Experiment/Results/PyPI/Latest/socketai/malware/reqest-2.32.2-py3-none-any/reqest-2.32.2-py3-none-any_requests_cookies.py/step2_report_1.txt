  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Describes cookie compatibility utilities, reading from request URLs, headers, and response headers. Data flow is standard.\n- **Potential Risks:** No data leaks, unsafe code, or suspicious external activity. The only notable point is the `add_header` method raising `NotImplementedError`, which is typical for certain interfaces.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code performs standard cookie management tasks. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal, justified), Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable. The low security risk and malware score align with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on cookie utilities and compatibility.\n- **Potential Risks:** No malicious activity or suspicious external calls. Thread safety measures are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cookie handling, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are consistent with the report's findings. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Cookie handling, extraction, and management.\n- **Potential Risks:** No malicious behaviors or external connections. The functions are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cookie management code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) compared to previous reports, possibly reflecting the cookie manipulation functions, but still minimal. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Compatibility utilities, cookie extraction, and management.\n- **Potential Risks:** No suspicious external activity or obfuscation. Exception handling and thread safety are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Cookie handling, extraction, and header generation.\n- **Potential Risks:** No malicious behaviors, external calls, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cookie management code, consistent with expectations.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores align well with the report's findings.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern. Given the code's purpose and no suspicious activity, these are reasonable.\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (average ~0.15)\n\nThe code appears to be legitimate, standard utility code for cookie management within the requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I see no reason to adjust the existing scores. They are consistent with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.15 (average)  |\n\nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
