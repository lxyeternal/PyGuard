  "purpose": "Compatibility utilities and cookie management functions for the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Code reads cookie data from request headers, response headers, and cookie objects; also reads environment via imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie storage modification, and cookie extraction into jar.",
  "flows": "Request object -> cookie extraction from response -> cookie header creation for requests -> cookie jar updates and lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. Proper exception handling in cookie creation and conversion functions. No code injection, obfuscated code, or suspicious external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of utilities for handling cookies within the requests library context, including classes for cookie storage and functions for creating, extracting, and managing cookies. No signs of malicious behavior such as network transmission of system data, backdoors, or unauthorized system modifications. The code adheres to expected patterns for cookie handling, with correct use of exception handling, thread safety in copying, and flexible cookie management. No external or embedded malicious payloads detected, and the code appears to be straightforward compatibility and utility code for cookie management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie handling utilities for requests, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly manages cookies and interfaces with request and response objects without suspicious behaviors.",
