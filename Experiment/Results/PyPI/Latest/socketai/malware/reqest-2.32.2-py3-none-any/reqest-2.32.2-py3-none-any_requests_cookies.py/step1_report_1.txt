{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility utilities for managing cookies within the 'requests' library, including cookie extraction, cookie jar manipulation, and cookie creation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include HTTP request objects (via 'request') and HTTP response headers (via 'response' and its '_original_response.msg'). Data is read from request URLs, headers, and response headers.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into cookie jars via 'extract_cookies_to_jar', 'set_cookie', and 'merge_cookies'. Potential untrusted data could be injected into cookies or headers, but no direct data leaks or unsafe execution is observed.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from response headers into a CookieJar; cookies are retrieved or set based on request parameters; cookie data can be merged or deleted. Data flows from HTTP responses/requests into cookie storage, with no external command execution or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network connections are present. The code includes standard cookie handling procedures. No obfuscation or unusual language features are detected. The 'add_header' method raises NotImplementedError, which is normal for certain interfaces but worth noting. No hidden or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling logic for HTTP interactions, wrapping request and response headers into cookie jar objects. It provides functions for extracting cookies, creating cookies from Morsel objects, and managing cookies within a jar. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is evident. Use of threading Lock is for thread safety in cookie management. The code is consistent with known patterns and lacks suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for managing cookies within the 'requests' library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The functions perform expected operations for cookie handling, with no evidence of malicious data flow or covert activities.",
