  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any signs of malicious activity, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Standard cookie handling utilities, reading from request URLs, headers, and response headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookies are extracted, created, and managed within cookie jars. No external or untrusted data flows into network or system commands.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Thread safety measures are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a typical, well-structured cookie utility with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues, malicious activity unlikely. Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar to report 1—standard cookie utilities, reading from headers and response objects.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header generation, and cookie management, all standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious external calls, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. Thread safety is properly handled.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate utility, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Again, standard cookie management, reading from request/response headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header creation, jar manipulation—standard operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious external activity or obfuscation. Functions are typical for cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, straightforward code, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious signs. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Compatibility and utility functions for cookies, reading from request and response objects.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header generation, and jar management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no external network activity, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Standard utility code, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar to previous reports—cookie utilities, request/response headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, header creation, cookie jar updates.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no suspicious external calls, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports have malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature—standard cookie management utilities with no network exfiltration, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the code performs typical cookie handling without external or malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal risk, standard utility code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-implemented cookie utility module for the requests library. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate; the code is standard, secure, and free of malicious behaviors. The assigned scores are reasonable and should remain as they are.",
