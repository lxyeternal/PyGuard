    "Importing from a local module .pyarmor_runtime_000000",

  "flows": [
    "Import from local module -> call __pyarmor__ with filename and binary blob -> runtime code potentially decrypts or executes the binary blob",
    "Binary data flows into __pyarmor__ which may decrypt or interpret it, possibly leading to code execution"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of heavily obfuscated code with binary data blobs instead of clear logic",
    "Binary blobs embedded directly in code, indicating possible encryption or obfuscation",
    "No explicit code logic, only import and function call with binary data",
    "Filename and data contain 'PY000000' and 'non-profits', which are non-standard and could be used for license or obfuscation purposes"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code imports a module likely responsible for runtime decryption or unpacking ('pyarmor_runtime_000000') and immediately calls a function __pyarmor__ with the current module name, file, and a large binary data blob. This pattern suggests code obfuscation or licensing enforcement rather than malicious behavior. The binary data is likely encrypted or obfuscated code that would be decrypted and executed at runtime. There are no network connections, system modifications, or data leaks visible. The purpose appears to be to protect or hide the actual code logic behind obfuscation, not to perform malicious actions. The use of binary blobs and dynamic execution is typical in code licensing tools like Pyarmor and is not inherently malicious, though it complicates static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, likely part of a runtime or licensing tool such as Pyarmor, which uses encrypted or obfuscated binary data and dynamic execution. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage was found. The primary concern is the potential for runtime unpacking/execution of encrypted code, but this is typical for code protection tools and not malicious per se.",
