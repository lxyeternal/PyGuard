{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated/protected code, likely part of licensing or anti-tampering mechanisms (Pyarmor).",
  "sources": "Import from local module, call to __pyarmor__ with embedded encrypted data.",
  "sinks": "Potential malicious if embedded data contains payloads/backdoors, but no explicit indicators.",
  "flows": "Import -> call __pyarmor__ with binary blob; the blob may decrypt or execute code.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, encrypted binary data, no comments or external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern is typical of Pyarmor-protected scripts, involving encrypted payloads to prevent tampering. No network activity or system modifications are visible. The embedded binary data could conceal licensing info or obfuscated code, but there's no evidence of malicious intent. The heavy obfuscation and encrypted blobs are consistent with legitimate licensing or anti-reverse engineering measures rather than malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Pyarmor runtime loader or license enforcement wrapper, not malicious. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and malware likelihood is very low. Static analysis alone cannot confirm the safety of embedded data, but no signs of malicious activity are present.",
