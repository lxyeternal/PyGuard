  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to configure the packaging of a Python library named 'sysfunc', specifying its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, author, description, and Python version requirement.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The script does not perform any I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves static reading of package configuration data from the script itself; no dynamic data flow or user input is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code is a standard setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a basic setup configuration for a Python package. The data used is static and typical for package setup scripts. No code injection, environment variable misuse, or network activities are present. The author name appears to be a regular string and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code functions as a typical setup configuration without any security risks or malicious behavior.",
