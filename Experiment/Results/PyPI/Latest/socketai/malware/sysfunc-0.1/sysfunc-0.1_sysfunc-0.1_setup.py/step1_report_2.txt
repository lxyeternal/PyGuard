{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'sysfunc' Python package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data are static strings and package metadata defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script only calls setup() with predefined arguments.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a straightforward setup script without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard setup tools with typical package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static package metadata such as name, version, packages, description, author, python_requires, and classifiers. There are no dynamic inputs, environment variable reads, network operations, or executable code that could indicate malicious behavior. All content appears to be standard package configuration code for publishing a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a standard package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply describes the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
