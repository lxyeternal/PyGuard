  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution of the 'sysfunc' Python library.",
  "sources": "No specific data sources; configuration parameters for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; setup script primarily for package installation and metadata definition.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or untrusted input processing present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py structure with typical package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools and calls setup() with metadata such as name, version, packages, description, author, python_requires, and classifiers. All fields are standard for a Python package setup file. No code execution, input handling, or dynamic behavior that could be exploited is present. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious logic are detected. The author name appears as a pseudonym or identifier, but this alone is not suspicious. The overall structure indicates a typical setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a standard package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata for distribution purposes.",
