  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or output functions",
  "flows": "Import statement potentially loads a runtime module, but no data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating trial version and expiration date; no suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a runtime module related to Pyarmor, a known obfuscation/protection tool. No code execution, data input, or malicious activity is present. The comment may be for informational purposes regarding the Pyarmor version and trial status. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign import statement related to code obfuscation with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
