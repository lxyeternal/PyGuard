{
  "purpose": "Import __pyarmor__ from pyarmor_runtime, likely for runtime protection or obfuscation handling.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only imports a module attribute.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comments indicating Pyarmor version, trial status, and timestamp; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a module associated with Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation and licensing tool. The comments suggest the code is part of an obfuscated or protected script, but there is no malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The minimal nature of the code and comments align with standard practices for protected code. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscation score of 0.2 reflects the presence of obfuscation tools and licensing comments, which is reasonable. The security risk score of 0.1 indicates very low risk, primarily due to licensing information, not security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of a protected or obfuscated script using Pyarmor. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
