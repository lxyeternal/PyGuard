  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or runtime protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.pyarmor_runtime' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data output or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Importing __pyarmor__ from pyarmor_runtime module; no data flow or untrusted input processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates use of Pyarmor 9.0.6 trial version, which is related to code obfuscation; however, the code itself is minimal and straightforward. No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a comment line noting the Pyarmor version and a single import statement from a relative module. The import appears to be part of an obfuscation or licensing mechanism, not malicious behavior. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious activities, or obfuscation tactics beyond standard packaging practices. The code is very minimal and appears legitimate in the context of protected or obfuscated Python code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with a descriptive comment about Pyarmor, likely for runtime obfuscation or licensing. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
