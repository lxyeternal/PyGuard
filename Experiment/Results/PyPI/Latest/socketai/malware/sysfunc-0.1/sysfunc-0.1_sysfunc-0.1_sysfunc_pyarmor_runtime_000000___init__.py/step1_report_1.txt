  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely related to code obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",
  "sources": "The code imports __pyarmor__ from the pyarmor_runtime module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating Pyarmor version and trial info, which suggests obfuscation or licensing enforcement; no malicious code or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module related to Pyarmor, a tool for code obfuscation and licensing. The only operation is a simple import statement. The comment indicates trial version info and a timestamp, which is typical in obfuscated or protected scripts. No suspicious activity, code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, benign import statement associated with code obfuscation or licensing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
