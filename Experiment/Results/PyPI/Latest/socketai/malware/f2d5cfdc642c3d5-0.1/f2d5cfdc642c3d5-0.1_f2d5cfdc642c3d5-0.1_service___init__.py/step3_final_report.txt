  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static message output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static print statement with no external interactions, data flows, or malicious constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature. No security issues, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and correctly assess the code as safe. No adjustments are necessary.",
