  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to automatic, covert data collection and transmission during package installation. While it lacks destructive payloads, its stealthy exfiltration activities justify high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but its behavior warrants caution and further review."
