{
  "purpose": "The code performs covert data collection and exfiltration during package installation, gathering filesystem info, user details, and system commands, then transmitting this data to an external server without user consent.",
  "sources": "Filesystem traversal functions, subprocess command execution, environment variables, and current user detection.",
  "sinks": "HTTP connection request to external server with encoded system info, network transmission during install.",
  "flows": "Source functions (filesystem, subprocess, environment) -> encoding in base64 -> HTTP request to external server during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, hardcoded server URL, data collection triggered during install, no user prompt or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code collects directory structure, user info, and system command output, encodes it, and sends it over the network during installation, which is suspicious. The network activity and data collection are performed silently, indicating potential covert exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the behavior itself is malicious or privacy-invasive. The network request uses a hardcoded URL with a dynamic path, further indicating malicious intent. The malware score of approximately 0.75 and security risk score of about 0.8 are justified based on the covert data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious behavior due to automatic, covert data collection and transmission during package installation. While it lacks destructive payloads, its stealthy exfiltration activities justify high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but its behavior warrants caution and further review.",
