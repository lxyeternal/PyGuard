  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard libraries and performs some basic operations.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input are detected; no input functions or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are observed.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows that could lead to data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, performs basic operations, and lacks any network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious intent. The absence of external inputs, suspicious function calls, or insecure practices suggests it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard in nature.",
