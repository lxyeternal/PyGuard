  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input points include environment variables, user inputs, network connections, and dynamic code execution via eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points such as network transmission, file modifications, or environment variable access that could leak sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Sources like environment variables or inputs flow into functions like eval, exec, or network modules, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, hardcoded strings, or suspicious network domains; otherwise, code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are generally straightforward, with no overt malicious activities such as data exfiltration, destructive routines, or backdoors. Obfuscation is only suspected in report 1, which mentions techniques like eval or ambiguous variable names. Most reports show minimal or no obfuscation, with low malware scores (0 to 0.1). Security risks are low (0.1 to 0.2), consistent with benign code. Confidence levels are high across reports, with slight overconfidence in some due to limited context. The scores align with the descriptions, and no significant issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are low risk, with minimal or no malicious intent. Obfuscation suspicion is moderate only in report 1. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use, with scores appropriately reflecting the low threat level.",
