{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a Python package, importing various modules and defining functions or classes, likely related to data processing or application logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, or external modules. Specific input sources are not explicitly detailed, but typical sources include os.environ and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or data output functions. No explicit network or file write operations are directly visible, but imported modules may perform such actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, function inputs) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network or file operations. No direct evidence of untrusted data reaching dangerous sinks is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident. The code uses standard library imports and functions. No signs of malicious backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines functions without evident suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments are present. The structure appears typical for a Python application. Without execution or more context, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The code does not exhibit indicators of malware such as system damage, unauthorized data access, or network exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard Python module setup. Confidence in this assessment is high, with minimal suspicion of obfuscation or malware.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
