  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static code; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup configuration, no data flow or execution beyond package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' suggest malicious or provocative intent; no malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It contains package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, and URL. There are no external data reads, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious code. The presence of provocative author email and URL indicates possible malicious intent or at least malicious branding, but the code itself is a benign configuration script. No suspicious functions, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration with no malicious code or security risks present. The notable aspect is the provocative contact information, which may be intended as a joke or malicious branding, but does not affect code security.",
