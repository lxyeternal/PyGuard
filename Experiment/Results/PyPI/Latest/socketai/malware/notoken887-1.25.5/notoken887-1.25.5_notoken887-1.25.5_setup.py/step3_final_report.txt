{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script defines package metadata for a Python library, with no dynamic code or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as author_email and url, which are static and hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processing present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static metadata without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author_email ('hitler@gmail.com') and url ('https://thugging.org') are unprofessional and potentially malicious in tone, but do not affect code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with static metadata. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The suspicious contact info and URL are metadata concerns only, not security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to unprofessional contact details. These scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code, with metadata concerns not translating into actual security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard, with unprofessional metadata that does not constitute a security risk. The overall malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting metadata concerns rather than code-based vulnerabilities.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
