{
  "purpose": "This code provides an encryption and decryption mechanism for tokens, using character replacements and string reversals. The decryption involves fetching and executing external script content, then reversing the transformation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input string in encrypt/decrypt methods, and fetches external script content via requests.get in the decrypt method.",
  "sinks": "The decrypt method executes external script fetched from 'https://thugging.org/static/gg.vbs' using exec().",
  "flows": "Input string to encryption/decryption functions; external script fetched during decryption is executed, which then affects control flow.",
  "anomalies": "The decrypt method executes arbitrary code fetched from an external URL, which is a significant security concern. The code also performs extensive string replacements for encoding/decoding without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs string manipulation for encoding and decoding tokens, which appears benign on the surface. However, the critical concern is the line in decrypt(): 'exec(requests.get(...).text)', which executes arbitrary code from an external source without verification. This introduces high risk of executing malicious payloads, effectively giving remote control to an attacker. The rest of the code is straightforward, involving reversible character replacements and string reversals, with no other external inputs or network interactions. No other suspicious patterns or backdoors are evident besides the external script execution.",
  "conclusion": "While the encoding/decoding logic appears benign, the external script execution via 'exec()' represents a severe security risk, potentially allowing remote code execution. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent or at least a critical security flaw.",
