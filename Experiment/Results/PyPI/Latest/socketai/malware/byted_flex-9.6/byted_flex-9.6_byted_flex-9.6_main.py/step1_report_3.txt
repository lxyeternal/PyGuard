  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses, and base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls sending HTTP GET requests with encoded system data as URL parameters to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) -> URL construction with encoded MACs -> HTTP request to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of system-specific commands to retrieve MAC addresses, which could be used for fingerprinting. Multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, possibly for tracking or data exfiltration. The base64-encoded MAC addresses are sent without encryption, and the URLs appear obfuscated or malicious. No explicit user consent prompts or data handling logs.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host-specific information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses using platform-dependent system commands. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data to multiple remote URLs via GET requests. The URLs are non-standard and potentially malicious, possibly used for tracking or fingerprinting. The code does not perform any harmful actions like file modification, process creation, or network abuse, but it does collect and transmit potentially sensitive device identifiers without user consent. The behavior suggests fingerprinting, tracking, or malicious data collection, especially considering the suspicious URLs and unencrypted transmission of device identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs passive system information collection and sends this data to external servers, which could be used for malicious tracking or fingerprinting. There are no direct indicators of destructive malware, but the data collection and transmission behaviors are suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the context of the URLs used.",
