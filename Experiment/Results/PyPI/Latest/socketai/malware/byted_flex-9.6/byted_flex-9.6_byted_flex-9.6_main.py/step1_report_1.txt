  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it encoded to specific external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded and included as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs are suspicious, pointing to domains with unconventional and potentially malicious intent. Encoding MAC addresses with base64 is typical, but combined with external data exfiltration attempts raises concern. No user input or untrusted data is handled in a risky manner; however, the communication pattern is potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system info such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are base64-encoded and included as URL parameters. The code then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends GET requests with the system info as query parameters. The URL endpoints are suspicious and likely used for data exfiltration or tracking. The code does not process user input or execute malicious commands, but it actively transmits system info to external, untrusted servers, indicating possible malicious intent. There is no obfuscation; the code is straightforward. The main concern is the exfiltration of system details via HTTP GET requests to suspicious domains, which is indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect and send system information to external malicious domains, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. It does not perform harmful actions directly on the system but is likely used for tracking, reconnaissance, or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or malware code patterns are present beyond this data transmission behavior.",
