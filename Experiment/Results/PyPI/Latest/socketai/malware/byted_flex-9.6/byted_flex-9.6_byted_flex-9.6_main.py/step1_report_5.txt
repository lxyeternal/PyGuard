{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to external URLs for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which uses subprocess to run system commands), base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and the URLs with query parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen calls to external URLs with parameters containing collected system data, potentially allowing data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source functions (platform.node, getpass.getuser, os.getcwd, get_mac_addresses) collect data -> data is encoded and embedded into URL parameters -> data is transmitted via urlopen to third-party servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded external domains with suspicious TLDs (oast.cn, oast.fun), encoding of MAC addresses in base64 (possibly to obfuscate data), collection of system MAC addresses and hostname without user consent or clear purpose. The URLs and data collection pattern resemble potentially malicious tracking or reconnaissance activity.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers various system identifiers, encodes MAC addresses, and sends them to multiple external servers without user consent. The use of subprocess calls to retrieve MAC addresses across different OSes can be considered invasive. The external URLs appear suspicious and are likely controlled by a malicious actor, especially given their structure and TLDs. The code does not perform any malicious actions like executing harmful commands or modifying files, but it does collect and transmit potentially sensitive system information, which indicates malicious intent for tracking or reconnaissance. There is no clear benign purpose for this behavior in standard applications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to gather system information and send it to external, suspicious URLs, which is indicative of potential malicious activity such as device fingerprinting or data exfiltration. The activity aligns with reconnaissance behaviors. No other malicious actions are evident, but the data collection and transmission are concerning from a security perspective.",
