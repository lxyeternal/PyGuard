{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to specific external URLs.",
  "sources": "Platform.system(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (which reads network interface data), and random.randint() for generating rd_num.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which sends constructed URLs containing collected data to external servers.",
  "flows": "Data from system info functions (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses, random number) flows into URL parameters, which are then sent over HTTP requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses; multiple external URLs with obfuscated or suspicious domain names; lack of data validation or encryption before transmission; silent exception handling that suppresses errors; collection and transmission of system identifiers without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system details such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs to send this information along with a randomly generated number to external domains. The external URLs are potentially malicious or suspicious, given their obfuscated domain names and use of oast-cn and oast.fun TLDs, which are often used in security testing or malicious C2 servers. Data flows from system info sources to network sinks via URL parameters, with no user notification or consent. Exception handling is minimal and silent, possibly to avoid detection of failures. Overall, the code appears designed to collect and transmit sensitive system data to external servers without user knowledge, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system identifiers and transmits them covertly to external servers under suspicious domain names. Its behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities. The use of obfuscated URLs, silent exception handling, and the nature of data collected suggest malicious intent, although it does not perform direct malicious actions like system modification or malware deployment. Overall, it poses a security risk, indicating potentially malicious behavior.",
