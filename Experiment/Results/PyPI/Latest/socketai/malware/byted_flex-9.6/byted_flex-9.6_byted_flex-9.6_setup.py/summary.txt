  "conclusion": "Executing 'main()' during installation introduces a significant security risk, as it allows arbitrary code execution at a critical point in the setup process. Without verifying the content of 'main()', this pattern is dangerous and should be flagged as high risk. The current reports' scores are conservative; a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.8 are appropriate to reflect the potential threat."
