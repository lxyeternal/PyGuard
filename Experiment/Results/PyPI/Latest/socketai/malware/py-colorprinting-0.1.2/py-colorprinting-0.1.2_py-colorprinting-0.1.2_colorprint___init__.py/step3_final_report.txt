  "purpose": "Package initialization by importing the ColorPrint class from the core module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .core import ColorPrint' reads the core module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the package's __init__.py to the core module to expose ColorPrint; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement used for package setup. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or malicious activity. The simplicity and standard pattern indicate benign intent. No anomalies or security issues are detected, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package import with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity.",
