  "purpose": "Import the ColorPrint class from the core module of the colorprint package, likely for use in printing colored text.",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing the ColorPrint class from a local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external data sinks, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a straightforward import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for a package initializer",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module within a package. It appears to be part of a package's __init__.py to expose the ColorPrint class. There are no signs of data processing, user input, network communication, or obfuscated code. The structure is standard for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initializer importing a class for use elsewhere. It shows no malicious behavior or security risks.",
