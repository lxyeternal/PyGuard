  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement: `from .core import ColorPrint`. This is a standard pattern in Python packages, typically found in `__init__.py` files to expose classes or functions at the package level.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Anomalies**  \n- No report mentions any suspicious code, obfuscated code, or signs of malware.  \n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network communication, or handle sensitive data.  \n- The minimal nature of the code and its context as a package initializer strongly suggest benign intent.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \n- No logical errors or flaws are identified.  \n- The import statement appears correct and standard.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- Obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statement.  \n- Security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n5. **Potential for Misinterpretation or Assumptions**  \n- The reports are careful not to assume malicious intent beyond what the code indicates.  \n- They correctly identify this as a standard package setup pattern.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \nGiven the simplicity and standard nature of the code, and the absence of any suspicious or malicious indicators, the scores seem appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Keep at 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Keep at 0, as there's no security risk evident.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the actual code content.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign package initialization import statement with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
