{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and potentially network communication, but the specific purpose is unclear without detailed context.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports standard and third-party libraries, potentially reads files or network inputs depending on the usage of imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses network modules or file I/O which could lead to data leakage if untrusted data is transmitted or saved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or external inputs through processing functions to network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious code. Unusual imports or dynamic code execution are not detected. The code structure appears standard, but lack of comments makes intent less clear.",
  "analysis": "Initial inspection shows typical Python code involving data processing. No suspicious network connections, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are identified. The code’s purpose and data flows appear normal, but without execution context or further details, certainty is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code looks standard with no suspicious anomalies. Slight caution is advised due to limited context, but overall risk appears low.",
