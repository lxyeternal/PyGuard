  "purpose": "The code appears to be standard setup or data processing with no suspicious activity.",
  "sources": "Module imports, data processing functions, user input, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows into files, network, or environment variables, but no malicious or untrusted sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks are not explicitly present; if any, they are benign and typical.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are minimal or standard setup, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.2). The confidence levels are high given the limited but benign code. No anomalies or suspicious flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "All provided code snippets are benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
