  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file and importing 'setuptools' functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Static data read from 'README.md' during setup; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' without a context manager; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The only minor style issue is the absence of a context manager when opening 'README.md', which does not impact security. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The dependency on 'requests' is benign. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All signals indicate a safe implementation.",
