  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'tronyx' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks present; no data being written or sent externally by this script.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; static setup configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated constructs; standard setup script with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical setup for a Python package, reading a README file and configuring package metadata. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no network operations or credential handling. The dependencies are limited to 'requests', a common package, with no embedded secrets or hidden code. The code structure and syntax are straightforward and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks detected. It simply prepares package metadata for distribution.",
