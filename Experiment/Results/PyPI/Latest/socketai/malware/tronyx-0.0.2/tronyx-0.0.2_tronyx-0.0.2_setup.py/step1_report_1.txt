  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'tronyx' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "Reading file content to populate long_description, then passing static parameters to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to be standard setup script without suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools and reads a local README.md file for long description. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and repository URL. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. All code is static and typical for package setup scripts. The only external data source is the README file, which is expected for package documentation. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs routine setup tasks without any security risks.",
