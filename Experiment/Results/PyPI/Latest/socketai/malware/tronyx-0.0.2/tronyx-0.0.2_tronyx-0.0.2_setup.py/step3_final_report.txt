  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'tronyx' library, reading README.md for long description, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; static code with no external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data flows or network operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted sources; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Minor comment '#Add a comma here' which is harmless; URL typo ('https://github.com/promobro/tronx') possibly inconsistent but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign. The only minor concern is the security risk score of 0.1 in one report, which is unjustified given the code's simplicity. The typo in the URL is a documentation issue, not a security flaw. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. The small security risk score should be lowered to zero to reflect the absence of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are accurate; the slight security risk score in one report is unwarranted and should be adjusted to zero. Overall, the dependency is safe for use.",
