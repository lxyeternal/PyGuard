{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to send a private key to an external server and then fetches a switcher value to determine a return status.",
  "sources": "The function reads the 'private_key' parameter as input; constructs 'transaction_data' (though incorrectly as a set); performs network POST and GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The POST request transmits 'transaction_data' containing the private key to an external server, potentially leading to data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input 'private_key' flows into 'transaction_data' (intended as a dict), then is sent via POST request; the GET request retrieves a switcher value that influences the function's return.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a set instead of a dictionary for 'transaction_data'; misspelling 'ptivat_key' instead of 'private_key'; transmits sensitive data over network without encryption; lacks error handling; suspicious URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to send a private key externally, indicating potential data leakage. The syntax error (set instead of dict) prevents execution but suggests poor coding or obfuscation. The consistent pattern across reports shows suspicion of malicious intent. The transmission of private keys without encryption is a serious security concern. The high malware (0.75) and security risk (0.8) scores are justified given the potential for exfiltration. The code's intent appears malicious, with signs of poor quality or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high potential for malicious behavior, primarily through insecure transmission of private keys to external servers. Despite syntax errors, the pattern indicates possible data exfiltration, warranting a malware score of 0.75 and a security risk score of 0.8. It should be considered unsafe for deployment and reviewed thoroughly.",
