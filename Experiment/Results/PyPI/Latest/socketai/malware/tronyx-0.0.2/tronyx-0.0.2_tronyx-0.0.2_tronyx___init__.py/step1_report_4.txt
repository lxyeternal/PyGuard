  "purpose": "Importing the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads code from a local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be performed from this single line; it simply imports code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement, with no obvious anomalies or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement from a local module. It does not execute any code or handle data directly. No suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Since this is only a fragment, no external input or untrusted data sources are involved, and no sinks are triggered.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard module import with no evident security risks.",
