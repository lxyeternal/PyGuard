  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a local module 'main' using relative import syntax.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; this is a simple import statement with no data processing or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only performing an import with no additional logic or data handling. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single relative import statement, which is common in modular Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The simplicity suggests standard project structure without any embedded malware or backdoors. Due to the limited code, no further analysis of malicious intent is possible.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard component of a larger codebase.",
