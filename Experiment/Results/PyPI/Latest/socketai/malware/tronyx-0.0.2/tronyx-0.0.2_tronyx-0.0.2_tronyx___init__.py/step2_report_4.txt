  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .main import perm` or similar variants.\n- The reports consistently conclude that this is a benign, standard import with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1), which aligns with the minimal code being straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The import statement is present in all reports, and no additional code or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports find evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- **Error or flaw:** No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports' reasoning.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- **Risk score:** Most reports assign 0 or 0.1, which seems reasonable since an import statement alone is generally low risk unless the imported module is malicious.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only slight inconsistency is the **securityRisk** score in report 4, which is 0.1 despite no evidence of risk. Given the minimal code, this should probably be 0.\n- The confidence levels are high, which is justified given the simplicity, but the reports acknowledge that without additional context, certainty is limited.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are the claims about benign nature justified?** Yes, the import statement is standard and does not exhibit malicious patterns.\n- **Are the scores appropriate?** Yes, all are consistent with the evidence. No changes needed unless further context reveals issues.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no evident security risk)\n- **Confidence:** 0.8 to 1, reflecting high certainty based on minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                  |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No evidence of malicious code or behavior                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Clear, straightforward import statement                        |\n| Security Risk   | 0                 | No vulnerabilities or suspicious activity identified          |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** While the import statement alone appears safe, a comprehensive security assessment would require inspecting the `main` module's content to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code or backdoors. However, based solely on this snippet, the code is benign.",
