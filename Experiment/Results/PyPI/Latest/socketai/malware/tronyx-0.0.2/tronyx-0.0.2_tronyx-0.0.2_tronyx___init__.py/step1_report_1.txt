  "purpose": "Importing the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads code from a local module file 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be performed from this single line without additional context.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; there are no suspicious or unusual patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports 'perm' from a local module named 'main'. There is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity in this line. As it is only an import statement, it does not perform any actions or contain embedded malicious code by itself. Additional context from the 'main' module would be necessary to perform a more thorough review, but based solely on this line, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and standard for Python projects.",
