{
  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' function from a local module named 'main' using relative import syntax.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; the import is static and does not involve data flow at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement in Python, importing 'perm' from the 'main' module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal nature of the code suggests benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, risk score 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet alone. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and standard syntax.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The import statement is standard and safe. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature; the only minor correction is setting the security risk score to 0 in report 4, which is already close to zero. Overall, the code poses no security concern.",
