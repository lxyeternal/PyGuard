  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a module named 'main' within the same package or directory.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'perm' from '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code snippet; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, only an import statement with no further context or logic. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior can be detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement in Python. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine if the imported 'perm' or the 'main' module contains malicious code or security issues. No sources or sinks are present here, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment alone is benign and appears to be a standard import statement. It provides no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. Additional context from the 'main' module or further code would be necessary for a comprehensive assessment.",
