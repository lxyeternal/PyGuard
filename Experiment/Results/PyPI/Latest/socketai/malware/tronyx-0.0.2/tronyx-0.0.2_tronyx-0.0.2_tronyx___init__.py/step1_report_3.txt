  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' attribute or function from the 'main' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data outputs or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet; it's a simple import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears standard; no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. There are no functions, data processing, or external communication present. This line alone does not exhibit any suspicious behavior or security issues. As it is only an import statement, it neither reads untrusted input nor acts as a sink. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detectable within this minimal code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
