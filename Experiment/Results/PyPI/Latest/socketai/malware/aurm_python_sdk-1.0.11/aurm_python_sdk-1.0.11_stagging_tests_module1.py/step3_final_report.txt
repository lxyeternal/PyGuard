  "purpose": "A simple test function returning a static string, serving as a placeholder or test case.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables are read.",
  "sinks": "No data is written or transmitted to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function is self-contained and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns a fixed string. All reports confirm the absence of external dependencies, input handling, or dynamic behavior. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature imply no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security concerns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
