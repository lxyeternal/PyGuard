  "purpose": "Standard package initializer exposing test_function from module1",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import from local module to __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or contain hidden logic. The code structure is standard for Python packages, and no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with appropriate scores and high confidence. No modifications are necessary.",
