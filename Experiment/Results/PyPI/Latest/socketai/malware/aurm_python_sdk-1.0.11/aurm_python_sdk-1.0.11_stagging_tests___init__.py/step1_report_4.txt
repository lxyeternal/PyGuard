  "purpose": "This is an initialization file for the 'tests' package, designed to import 'test_function' from 'module1' for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.module1' and the special attribute '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; it only imports a function and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a relative module and defines the __all__ list for module exports. It does not process or handle untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or include any malicious patterns. The file is standard for Python package initialization and testing setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward module initializer for testing purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
