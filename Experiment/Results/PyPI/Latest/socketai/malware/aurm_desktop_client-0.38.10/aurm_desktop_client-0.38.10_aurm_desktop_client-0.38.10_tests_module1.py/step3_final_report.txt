  "purpose": "This code defines a simple function returning a static string, serving as a benign test or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or environment variables; static code with no data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a constant string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static function with no inputs, outputs, dependencies, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, noting the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the analysis. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present, and the code does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the current scoring is appropriate. No further action or revision is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
