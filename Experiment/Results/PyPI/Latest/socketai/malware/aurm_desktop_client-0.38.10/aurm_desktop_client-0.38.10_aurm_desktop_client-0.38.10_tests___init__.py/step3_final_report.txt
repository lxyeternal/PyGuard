  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that imports a function and declares it in __all__, with no data leaks, external calls, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues is present. The code performs only standard import/export operations, and the analysis aligns with this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
