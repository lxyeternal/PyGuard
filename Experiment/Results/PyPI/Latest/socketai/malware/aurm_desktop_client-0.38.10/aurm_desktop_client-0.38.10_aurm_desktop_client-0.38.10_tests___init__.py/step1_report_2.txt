  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; the code only imports a function and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package __init__.py file that imports a function from a sibling module and defines an export list. There are no data inputs, no external calls, no data leaks, or security-sensitive operations. The code structure is straightforward and standard for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
