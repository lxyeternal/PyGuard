  "purpose": "Initialize the package namespace by importing a specific test function from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code only performs an import operation",
  "flows": "Import statement flows from the local module1 to the package namespace",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import and namespace declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'test_function' from a relative module 'module1' and declares it as part of the public API with __all__. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical __init__.py file setting up module exports. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are detected.",
