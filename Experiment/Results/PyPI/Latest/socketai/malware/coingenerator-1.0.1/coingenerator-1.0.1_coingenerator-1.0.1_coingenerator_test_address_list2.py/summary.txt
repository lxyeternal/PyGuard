  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with layered encoding and complex request handling, consistent with malicious or covert activity such as data exfiltration. The high obfuscation and network activity scores justify treating this dependency as potentially malicious. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."
