  "purpose": "To ensure the presence of the Quark tool by downloading and setting it up if not already available.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls for 'git clone', 'mv', and 'rm'; os.remove()",
  "flows": "os.system('git clone ...') -> os.system('mv ...') -> os.remove()",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to execute shell commands; no input validation or sanitization; hardcoded GitHub URL; removal of files and directories after download without verification.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if 'quark.html' exists in the current directory. If not, it clones a GitHub repository containing Quark, moves the necessary files into the current directory, removes the README, and deletes the cloned repository. The use of os.system() for executing shell commands introduces potential security concerns if the directory path is manipulated, although in this context, it appears to operate on the current working directory. The code downloads external code from a third-party source without verification, which could be exploited if the repository is compromised. However, no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are evident. The process appears to be a standard setup script for a dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an automated setup of an external tool (Quark) with standard commands. It does not exhibit malicious intent but relies on external sources and executes shell commands without input validation, which could pose security risks if the source is compromised. Overall, no malicious behavior is detected.",
