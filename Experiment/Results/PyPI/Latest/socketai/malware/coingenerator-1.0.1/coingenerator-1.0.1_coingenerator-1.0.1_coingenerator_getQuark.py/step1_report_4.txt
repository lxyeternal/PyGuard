  "purpose": "To ensure the presence of the Quark library for graph visualization by downloading and installing it if not already present.",
  "sources": "os.listdir() to check directory contents, os.getcwd() to get current working directory",
  "sinks": "os.system() commands executing git clone and move operations, os.remove() deleting README.md, shutil.rmtree() deleting the Quark directory",
  "flows": "Checks for 'quark.html' in current directory -> If not present, downloads Quark repository -> Moves libraries and HTML file -> Cleans up repository files",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system() with concatenated strings for shell commands, which could be exploited if variables are manipulated, but in this static code, no evident malicious payloads. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code verifies if 'quark.html' exists in the current directory. If missing, it clones the Quark repository from GitHub using os.system(), moves specific files into the current directory, deletes the README.md, and removes the repository folder. The process involves executing shell commands without input sanitization or validation, but the commands themselves are standard for file operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is apparent. The use of external cloning and file manipulation appears intended for setup purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The script automates downloading and setup of a visualization library with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The operations are straightforward file and directory manipulations for installation purposes.",
