  "purpose": "To ensure the presence of the Quark tool for graph visualization by downloading it if not already available.",
  "sources": "os.listdir(), os.getcwd(), user environment, and external Git repository",
  "sinks": "os.system() commands executing git clone, move, and remove operations",
  "flows": "Checks for 'quark.html' in current directory -> downloads Quark repository via git clone -> moves files -> deletes temporary Quark directory",
  "anomalies": "Uses os.system() for executing shell commands which may be prone to command injection if input is manipulated; no validation or sanitization of inputs; straightforward download and cleanup process, no obfuscation or encryption detected",
  "analysis": "The code first checks for the existence of 'quark.html'. If absent, it attempts to download Quark via a git clone command, move necessary files into the current directory, and clean up by deleting the cloned repository. The use of os.system() for executing shell commands is potentially risky, especially if any variables are influenced by untrusted input; however, in this case, static strings are used, reducing immediate risk. The overall logic is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious code or backdoors. The process is aimed at setup rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple setup task of downloading and installing a visualization tool if missing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only minor concern is the reliance on os.system() which could be unsafe if inputs are manipulated externally, but as written, it does not appear to be exploited for malicious purposes.",
