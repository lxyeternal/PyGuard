  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script that automates dependency management by cloning an external repository and moving files into place. No malicious activity or payloads are evident. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk around 0.3 are appropriate given the static commands and lack of malicious intent. To improve security, replacing os.system() with subprocess calls and verifying external repositories before cloning would be advisable."
