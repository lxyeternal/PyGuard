  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors that could be exploited maliciously, notably via dynamic code execution and obfuscation. While no explicit malware is confirmed, the suspicious practices warrant high caution. The overall security risk is moderate to high, with a malware score of approximately 0.7, an obfuscation score around 0.6, and a risk score near 0.75. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent and ensure safe deployment."
