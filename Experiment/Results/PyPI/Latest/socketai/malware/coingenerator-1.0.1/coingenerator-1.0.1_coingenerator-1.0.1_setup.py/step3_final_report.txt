  "purpose": "A straightforward setup script defining package metadata and dependencies for the 'coingenerator' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call, including package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional license string 'Python Script', which is non-standard but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static package configuration script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the absence of suspicious code, obfuscation, or network activity. The only noted anomaly is the license string, which is non-standard but harmless. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores are very low, with a minor overestimation in one report due to the license string. Overall, the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a benign, standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The only minor issue is the non-standard license string, which does not impact security. The malware score should remain 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
