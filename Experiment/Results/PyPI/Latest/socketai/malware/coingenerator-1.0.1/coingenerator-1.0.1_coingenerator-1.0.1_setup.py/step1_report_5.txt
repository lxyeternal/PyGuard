  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'coingenerator' used for transaction analysis.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup parameters (name, version, description, packages, author, license, install_requires, extras_require). No dynamic input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or external data leaks. The code primarily sets package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations. The code only registers package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The dependencies listed are standard, and there are no suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and invokes setup() with package metadata. All inputs are static strings or predefined data. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are utilized. The dependencies are standard (blessings ~= 1.7), with a dev dependency on pytest. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious injections, or suspicious behaviors. The license string 'Python Script' is non-standard but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions solely to configure package metadata and dependencies without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and standard for a Python package setup.",
