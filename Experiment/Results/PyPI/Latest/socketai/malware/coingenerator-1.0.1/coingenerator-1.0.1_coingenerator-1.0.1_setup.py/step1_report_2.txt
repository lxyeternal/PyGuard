{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the package metadata and dependencies for the 'coingenerator' Python package.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters: name, version, description, packages, author, license, install_requires, extras_require.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted dependencies in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "flows": "The package configuration data flows from setup() parameters to the packaging and installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The license is unusually named 'Python Script' which is not standard but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with metadata and dependencies. No user input or external data sources are involved. The dependencies specified are standard libraries or well-known packages. There are no dynamic or obfuscated elements. The license field has a non-standard value but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is a typical package setup script with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The package configuration appears benign and standard.",
