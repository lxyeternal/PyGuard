  "purpose": "Define and configure the package 'coingenerator' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters including package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The configuration parameters flow into the setup process to prepare the package for distribution.",
  "anomalies": "The license field is set to 'Python Script', which is non-standard and possibly a placeholder. The code imports and uses setuptools without additional logic, no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and optional requirements. No user input, network operations, or malicious behaviors are present. The license field is unusual but not malicious. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are found. The script's purpose is purely to facilitate package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only anomaly is the unusual license string, which is likely a placeholder or misconfiguration. Overall, it appears safe.",
