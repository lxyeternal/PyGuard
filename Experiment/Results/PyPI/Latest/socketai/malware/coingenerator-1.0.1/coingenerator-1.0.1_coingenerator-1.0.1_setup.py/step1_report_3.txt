  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'coingenerator' for distribution, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters such as name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows standard Python packaging conventions. The license value 'Python Script' is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for Python package distribution. It specifies package metadata and dependencies. No code execution, input processing, or dynamic behavior is present. The dependencies listed are standard, and no suspicious or malicious instructions are included. The license field contains an unconventional value but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears legitimate and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard for Python package distribution with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
