{
  "purpose": "The code reads external files, processes their contents by removing '0x' prefixes, concatenates and base64-decodes the data, then executes the resulting code dynamically. Its purpose appears to be to load and run external code, potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'test_address_list3.py' and 'test_address_list2.py', line reading and processing their contents.",
  "sinks": "The exec(v_data) call executes the decoded code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the external files contain malicious code.",
  "flows": "File reading -> string processing (removing '0x') -> concatenation -> base64 decoding -> exec() on decoded data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code execution via exec() on data loaded from external files; obfuscation through base64 encoding; removal of '0x' prefixes suggests obfuscation or encoding tricks.",
  "analysis": "The script loads external files, cleans and decodes their contents, then executes the decoded code. This pattern is inherently risky, especially if the external files are untrusted or malicious. The code does not validate or sandbox the executed code. The reports indicate 'Empty response' with no further details, providing no evidence of actual vulnerabilities or malicious payloads. The structure suggests potential for malicious activity, but without inspecting the external files, certainty is impossible. The obfuscation methods and dynamic execution warrant high suspicion. The scores should reflect high malware and risk potential due to the code's behavior, despite the lack of concrete evidence in the reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code's pattern of loading, decoding, and executing external code is suspicious and potentially malicious. The reports lack detailed responses or evidence, making it impossible to confirm malicious activity. Given the code's behavior, high suspicion is justified, and scores should be set accordingly, pending further inspection of the external files.",
