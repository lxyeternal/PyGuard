  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring consistency in scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code content:** Functions for blockchain data retrieval, database management, and testing scaffolding.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Uses standard libraries and practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). These are reasonable given the description.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's nature. No issues.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code content:** Similar functions for blockchain data, API requests, and database interactions.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior. The API request handles untrusted data but does so securely with error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These are justified, considering the external API data could be untrusted but is handled properly.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code content:** Similar blockchain data collection, database, and testing functions.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity. The code involves standard data processing and mocking.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate for the described functions.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code content:** Functions for blockchain data retrieval, database transaction management, and testing setup.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior or malicious intent. Extensive mocking and transaction handling are typical for testing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code content:** Similar data fetching, API querying, and transaction management functions.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no backdoors, no obfuscation. The code is for data collection/testing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; 0 is justified.\n- **Risk score:** All are low (0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns given the code's purpose.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, primarily due to external API handling untrusted data and extensive mocking in tests, which is standard practice)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of supply chain threats or malicious intent. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscation scores correctly reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.",
