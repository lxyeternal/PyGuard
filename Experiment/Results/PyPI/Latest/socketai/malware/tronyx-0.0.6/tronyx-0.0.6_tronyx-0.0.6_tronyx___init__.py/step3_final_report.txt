{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'perm' object from a sibling module 'main' within the same package, serving to utilize functionality defined elsewhere in the package structure.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are involved; the code merely imports a module component.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'perm' from '.main', establishing a dependency but no data flow or execution flow that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward relative import with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python import statement that loads 'perm' from a sibling module 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import is typical in modular Python packages and does not involve external data, network activity, or sensitive information handling. Given the simplicity and clarity, the code poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing assessments and scores are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
