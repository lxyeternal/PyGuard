{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a variable or function named 'perm' from a module named 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.main'. No external data input observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be conducted due to the minimal content, but the import could potentially load code or data from 'main'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are evident. The relative import indicates package structure, but no malicious indicators are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement, which is common in Python modules to reuse code within a package. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Without additional context from 'main', the import itself is benign. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe operations, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. It is a standard import statement typical of modular Python code.",
