  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the validity of their conclusions, the scoring, and any inconsistencies.\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue Presence:** The code is a straightforward import statement; no issues or malicious activity are evident.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n   - **Justification:** The low security risk score (0.1) seems reasonable given the simplicity of the code. Malware score is 0, which aligns with no malicious activity.\n   - **Assessment:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue Presence:** Same as above; a benign import statement.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n   - **Justification:** Correct, as no security issues are present.\n   - **Assessment:** The score is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue Presence:** Again, just an import statement.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n   - **Justification:** The analysis correctly states no malicious activity.\n   - **Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue Presence:** Same benign import.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n   - **Justification:** Consistent with previous reports.\n   - **Assessment:** No issues here.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue Presence:** Same as above; no issues.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n   - **Justification:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a simple relative import statement.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or very close) are consistent with the code snippet.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 or very close to it; no security issues.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Since the code is just an import statement, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided reports and their scoring.**",
