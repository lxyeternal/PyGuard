  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .main import perm`.\n- They consistently conclude that this is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating that the reviewers agree on the benign nature.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, aligning with the assessment that there's no malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code snippet is just an import statement; no issues are present in the code itself.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The relative import (`from .main`) is standard in Python packages.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- They correctly identify that, in isolation, this line does not pose security risks.\n- No overestimations or underestimations of risk are evident.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is justified.\n- The security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score.\n- The code is purely an import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All claims are cautious and based on minimal code, avoiding unwarranted assumptions.\n- They acknowledge the lack of context but reasonably conclude benign intent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- The confidence levels are justified given the simplicity and commonality of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, just to account for the package structure, but essentially negligible)\n\n**Note:** Since this is a single, straightforward import statement, the overall security risk remains extremely low. Without additional context or code, there's no evidence to suggest otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, and the risk assessment aligns with the evidence.",
