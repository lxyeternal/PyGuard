  "purpose": "Importing the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a static code element; no runtime data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only an import statement without further context.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with a simple relative import; no suspicious or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line importing 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. There are no variables, functions, or data processing. It is a common pattern in Python projects. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are visible. Since this is just an import statement, it does not inherently pose security risks or malicious intent. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a benign import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
