{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'perm' object or function from a module named 'main' in the same package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.main' to import 'perm'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the module '.main' to the current namespace via the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the use of relative import could be suspicious if the package structure is unusual; no hardcoded secrets or malicious indicators are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import of 'perm' from a sibling module 'main'. There are no external inputs, network operations, or data handling that suggest malicious activity. Since this is a single import statement, it doesn't provide enough context to evaluate for malicious behavior or security risks. The import is standard Python syntax for modular code organization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security issues. It is part of normal Python package structure and does not pose security risks by itself.",
