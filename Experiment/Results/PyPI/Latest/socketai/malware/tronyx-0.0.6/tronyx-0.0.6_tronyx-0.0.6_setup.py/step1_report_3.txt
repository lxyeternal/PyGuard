{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'tronyx'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and static metadata for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only assigns static strings and reads a local file.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> assigns to variable -> used in setup function; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs (though the URL is public), or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: importing modules, reading a local README file for documentation, and defining package metadata. It uses static data with no dynamic or user input. The URL provided is a public GitHub repository. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and adheres typical setup.py patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign and implements standard packaging procedures without any malicious intent or security risks.",
