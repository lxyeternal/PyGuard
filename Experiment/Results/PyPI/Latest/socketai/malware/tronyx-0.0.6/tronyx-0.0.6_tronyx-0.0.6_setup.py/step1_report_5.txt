  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'tronyx' Python library, including reading the README for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file in the current directory, importing 'setuptools' and 'Path', and defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data outputs or potentially harmful operations.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file, then passing static package information to the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The code follows standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setup() with static package metadata. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, user input handling, or any suspicious operations. The use of 'requests' in 'install_requires' is standard for dependencies. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
