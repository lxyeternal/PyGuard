{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tronyx' Python package, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; no external input sources; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks, network communication, or sensitive operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration without dynamic input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, specifies package details, dependencies, author info, and project URLs. No dynamic input, no network activity, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious operations are present. All elements appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily defines package metadata and dependencies without any malicious or anomalous code.",
