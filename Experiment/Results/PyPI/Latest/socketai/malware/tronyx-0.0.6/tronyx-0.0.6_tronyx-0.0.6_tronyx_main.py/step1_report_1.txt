  "purpose": "Send private key data to an external API endpoint and retrieve switcher status.",
  "sources": "The 'private_key' parameter input and the requests.get request to the 'switcher' URL.",
  "sinks": "The POST request sending 'transaction_data' to external API; the GET request retrieving data from external API.",
  "flows": "The 'private_key' is included in 'transaction_data' sent via POST, then a GET request fetches data from the switcher URL; no data returned is directly used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a typo in 'private_key' within the set (it's written as 'ptivat_key'), which may prevent proper data handling. The function posts private key data to an external API without encryption or obfuscation, raising privacy concerns. There is no input validation or sanitization. The switcher API's response is used directly without validation, potentially leading to unintended behavior. The URL appears suspicious, though it's hardcoded and obscure. No error handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a 'private_key' input, embeds it into a dictionary with a typo, and posts it to a hardcoded external API endpoint, which could lead to leaking sensitive private keys. It then makes a GET request to a second external API to check a switcher status, using the response directly without validation. The absence of input sanitization, error handling, and encryption suggests poor security practices. The external URL is obfuscated and potentially malicious, especially given the context of sending private data.",
  "conclusion": "The code potentially leaks private keys to an external service and fetches control data from another external URL, indicating malicious intent or severe security risks. The presence of hardcoded URLs, unprotected data transmission, and typographical errors further suggest poor security hygiene. Overall, this code poses significant privacy and security concerns.",
