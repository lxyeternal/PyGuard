  "purpose": "Provides decorators for local logging and external notification via a hardcoded webhook URL, along with a utility to retrieve the log file path.",
  "sources": "Reads timestamp, system home directory, and log file path; makes HTTP POST request to a fixed URL.",
  "sinks": "Local log file; external webhook endpoint receiving system info.",
  "flows": "Function call triggers logging to file and sends a POST request with system info to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded webhook URL, external request made synchronously during function execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two decorators: one logs function calls locally, the other sends system info to a fixed webhook URL. No user input, secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The webhook URL is static and publicly visible, which could be exploited if malicious. The external request transmits system info without validation or encryption. No obfuscation or code injection detected. The code's behavior is benign but potentially misused for data exfiltration if the URL is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign, serving logging purposes. The main security concern is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be exploited for data exfiltration or malicious notifications if malicious actors control the URL. No malware or obfuscation is present. The security risk score should be elevated to reflect the potential misuse of external communication, but malware remains absent.",
