  "purpose": "Utility module for emoji conversion, replacement, removal, and file writing.",
  "sources": "Reads input text for emoji replacement/removal; performs network request during class initialization.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions process untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities; network request is unused.",
  "flows": "Initialization triggers a network request; replacement/removal functions process text locally without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unprocessed external URL fetch in __init__; write_to_file method not marked as staticmethod, which could cause runtime errors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward emoji processing functions. The only external activity is an HTTP GET request during class instantiation, which is not processed or used, indicating a placeholder or incomplete feature. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The network request is benign but unnecessary. The write_to_file method lacks the @staticmethod decorator, which is a minor code quality issue but not security-related. Overall, the code is clear, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores of malware=0 and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily utility functions for emoji handling. The external URL fetch appears to be a placeholder, not malicious. No security threats or malware are detected. The minor code issues do not impact security. The overall security risk is minimal.",
