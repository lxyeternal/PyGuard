  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing classes and functions from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .emoji_converter and .logger.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data handling or output functions are called.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; only module imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes and functions from internal modules within the package. There are no inputs, no external data sources, and no data processing logic. The use of 'from .logger import *' is a general import statement, which is not inherently malicious but can be considered poor practice due to namespace pollution. However, it does not indicate malicious intent by itself. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal components. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies in this minimal setup.",
