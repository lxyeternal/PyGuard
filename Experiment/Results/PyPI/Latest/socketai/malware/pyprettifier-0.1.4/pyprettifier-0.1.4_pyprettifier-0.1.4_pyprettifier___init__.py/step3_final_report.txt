  "purpose": "Initialize package by importing specific modules and classes for namespace setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .emoji_converter and .logger",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved",
  "flows": "Import statements directly load modules/classes into namespace; no data flow or untrusted input/output",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import 'from .logger import *' which can obscure imported symbols but is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file with straightforward imports. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Wildcard import is discouraged for clarity but does not constitute malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. Malware scores are zero, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (0 or 0.1), acknowledging the minor maintainability concern due to wildcard import. Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1.0). The code poses no security threat or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing typical package initialization. The use of wildcard import is a minor concern but not malicious. Scores are appropriate and consistent across reports, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a very low security risk (~0.1). No further action is necessary.",
