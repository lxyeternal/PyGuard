  "purpose": "Initialize the pyprettifier package by importing necessary modules",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local package: .emoji_converter and .logger",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow present; just module imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from logger module could obscure what is imported, but not necessarily malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initializer that imports classes and modules from within the package. The use of a wildcard import from logger may make it difficult to track imported symbols but does not inherently pose a security risk or malicious intent. No external data inputs, sinks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears standard for a Python package init file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward package initialization with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
