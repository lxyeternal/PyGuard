  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing specific classes and modules",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (emoji_converter and logger)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink identified",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('from .logger import *') is generally discouraged, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file, importing classes and modules to set up namespace. The use of wildcard import could obscure which parts are imported, but this is a common practice in some codebases and does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code, data leaks, or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
