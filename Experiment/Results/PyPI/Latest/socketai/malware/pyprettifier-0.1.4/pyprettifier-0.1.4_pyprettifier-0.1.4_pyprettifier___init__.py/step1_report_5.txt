  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard import (from .logger import *) can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious or unintended code, but by itself is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes and modules from local files. The wildcard import is a potential concern for obscurity but not necessarily malicious. There are no data inputs, network operations, or sensitive actions here. No suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward module initialization with no signs of malicious behavior. The wildcard import is a potential maintenance concern but not malicious.",
