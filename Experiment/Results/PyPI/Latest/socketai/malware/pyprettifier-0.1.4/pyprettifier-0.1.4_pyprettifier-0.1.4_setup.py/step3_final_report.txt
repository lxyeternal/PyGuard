  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md file (source) used in setup() (sink) for package description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and unobfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a local README.md file and calls setup() with static package metadata. It does not execute dynamic code, perform network operations, or process untrusted input. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. All reports concur that the code is benign, with malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard packaging practices support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
