{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package called 'pyprettifier', used for packaging and distributing the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the current directory, and the setup() function parameters which include package metadata and dependencies.",
  "targets": "No explicit targets for untrusted data; no code injection, data leaks, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "N/A - The script primarily reads a file and calls setup(), with no untrusted data flow or user input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads a README file for a long description, and configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution. No external data input aside from reading a local file. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate, serving the purpose of packaging a Python project. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
