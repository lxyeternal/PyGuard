  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyprettifier' Python package, intended to define package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ path for the current directory, reading 'README.md' for long description, and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior. The code is a standard setup script without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python package setup conventions with 'setuptools'. It reads a README file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and requirements. There are no input/output flows involving untrusted sources or sinks, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
