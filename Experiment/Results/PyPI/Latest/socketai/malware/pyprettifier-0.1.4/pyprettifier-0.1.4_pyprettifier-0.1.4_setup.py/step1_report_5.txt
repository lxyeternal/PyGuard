  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'pyprettifier' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to determine the directory, reading the content of 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data is processed or output in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "The code reads the README.md file content to set as long_description during setup; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, determines its directory, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No code execution of external inputs, no dynamic code, and no suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging without any malicious intent or security risks.",
