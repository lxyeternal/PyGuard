{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'pyprettifier' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory path (__file__), reads the content of 'README.md' for the long description, and loads package information for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads the directory path -> reads 'README.md' -> uses the gathered information in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, reads a local README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, no network connections, and no suspicious behaviors. All components are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
