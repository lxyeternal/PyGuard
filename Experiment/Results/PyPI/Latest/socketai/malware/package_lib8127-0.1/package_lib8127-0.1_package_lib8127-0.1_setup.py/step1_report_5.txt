{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Imported modules and static strings within the setup() call, such as package metadata and URL.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup configuration is static and deterministic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py structure with no obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules and invokes setup() with static metadata fields. No dynamic code execution, environment variable usage, or data processing occurs. The description mentions running custom code on import, but this script itself does not execute any code beyond package metadata definition. There are no hardcoded credentials, network calls, or malicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration file for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package metadata definition without executing code or including suspicious logic.",
