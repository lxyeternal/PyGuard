  "purpose": "Define the package setup configuration for a Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading setup parameters and package discovery using setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output generated.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates 'runs custom code on import,' but no such code is present in this file; potential misleading comment but no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py imports setuptools and defines a package configuration with standard parameters such as name, version, packages, description, author, URL, classifiers, and Python requirement. The comment suggests executing custom code on import, but no such code exists here. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup.py structure. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or external network interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a standard configuration script for packaging a Python project. Despite the comment implying 'runs custom code on import,' no such code is present, and the script appears benign. No security risks or malicious behavior are identified.",
