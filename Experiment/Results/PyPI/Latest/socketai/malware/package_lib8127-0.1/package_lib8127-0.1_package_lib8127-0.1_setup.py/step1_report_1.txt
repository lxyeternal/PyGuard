{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for a Python package named 'package_lib8127'.",
  "sources": "The setup.py file itself, particularly the import statement and setup() call.",
  "outputs": "No direct outputs or data streams; primarily configuration data for package building.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involved; the script only calls setup() with static arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present. The description suggests 'runs custom code on import,' but no such code is actually present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with static, well-defined parameters. There is no code execution beyond the package metadata definition. The comment about running custom code on import is misleading; no such code exists here. No input reading, no dynamic code, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a straightforward package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The mention of 'runs custom code on import' appears to be a misleading comment, but the code itself contains nothing suspicious.",
