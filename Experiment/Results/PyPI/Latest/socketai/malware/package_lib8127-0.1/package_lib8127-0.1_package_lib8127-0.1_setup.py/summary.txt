  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script. The mention of 'runs custom code on import' is misleading but does not reflect actual behavior. The code contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The reports are accurate but slightly overstate risk due to comments; overall, the code is safe."
