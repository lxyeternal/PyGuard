{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input data from package metadata fields (name, version, description, author, url).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input data; standard setup process.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no suspicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The description states 'a package that runs custom code on import', which could imply side effects, but no such code is present in this setup script itself.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setuptools setup configuration. It imports only the necessary functions, specifies package metadata, and uses find_packages() to include modules. There is no code execution beyond the setup function call. The comment in 'url' is in Russian but does not affect execution. The description suggests potential side effects during import, but no such code exists in this file. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious behavior. The mention of 'runs custom code on import' is misleading, as no such code exists here; it likely refers to the package's runtime behavior, not this configuration script. Overall, no security risks or malware detected.",
