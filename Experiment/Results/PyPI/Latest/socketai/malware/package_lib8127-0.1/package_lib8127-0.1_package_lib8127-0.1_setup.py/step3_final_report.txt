  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for a Python project.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters, no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Comment stating 'runs custom code on import' is misleading; no such code exists.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script importing only setuptools and calling setup() with static metadata. The comment about executing code on import is false; no dynamic or malicious code is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with malware scores set to 0. Slightly elevated security risk scores (0.1) are due to misleading comments but are not justified by actual code behavior. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The code adheres to standard practices and does not pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script. The mention of 'runs custom code on import' is misleading but does not reflect actual behavior. The code contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The reports are accurate but slightly overstate risk due to comments; overall, the code is safe.",
