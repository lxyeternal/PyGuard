  "purpose": "This code imports a function 'run_your_code' from a local module 'my_module' during package initialization.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'my_module'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to the static import of 'run_your_code' from 'my_module'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement within '__init__.py', which is standard for Python packages. It does not execute or invoke the imported function, nor does it contain any dynamic code, obfuscation, or embedded secrets. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning high confidence and zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's simplicity and standard structure imply no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
