  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential leaks are present",
  "flows": "Import statement loads 'run_your_code' from 'my_module'; no data flows are evident",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The __init__.py file solely imports a specific function from a local module to initialize the package. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data handling, or complex logic. No sources, sinks, or data flows suggest security risks or malicious intent. The code appears to be standard package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign package initializer with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
