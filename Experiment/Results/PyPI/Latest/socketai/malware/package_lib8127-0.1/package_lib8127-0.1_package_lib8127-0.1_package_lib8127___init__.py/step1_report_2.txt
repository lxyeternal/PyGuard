  "purpose": "This package initialization code imports a function called run_your_code from my_module, likely to execute or set up package behavior upon import.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the my_module module when imported, specifically accessing run_your_code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data processing points in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads from my_module, but there are no data flows or execution flows involving external or untrusted data within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a local module during package initialization. No input reading, no data manipulation, and no execution of untrusted data are evident. Since the code does not execute run_your_code or perform any side effects, there is no malicious activity. The code appears standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package __init__.py file that imports a function from a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this snippet.",
