  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation based on provided code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user input, external files; no specific code snippets provided.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, file writes, system commands, environment variables usage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, file, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; descriptions indicate standard data handling.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying on descriptions indicating routine data processing with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Scores are consistently low (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2), reflecting cautious baseline due to limited context. Confidence scores are high (0.7-0.9), aligning with the absence of suspicious indicators. The reasoning across reports is coherent and appropriate, with no contradictions or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, the dependency shows no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified given the limited context but no signs of threat. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the dependency appears benign and safe for use.",
