      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high-risk pattern by executing external code during installation, which can be malicious. While the actual behavior of 'main' is unknown, this pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks. The scores in reports are consistent with this risk. Further investigation into 'pipofftheoldblock.run.main' is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious data exfiltration, employing covert DNS channels and encoding techniques to obfuscate the transmission of system information to an external server. The high malware and risk scores are justified by these activities, indicating a high probability of malicious intent. The obfuscation techniques, while not highly complex, are sufficient to evade casual detection. Overall, this dependency should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious, warranting further investigation or removal."

The low security risk score (0.2) is justified given the limited context but no signs of threat. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. Overall, the dependency appears benign and safe for use."
