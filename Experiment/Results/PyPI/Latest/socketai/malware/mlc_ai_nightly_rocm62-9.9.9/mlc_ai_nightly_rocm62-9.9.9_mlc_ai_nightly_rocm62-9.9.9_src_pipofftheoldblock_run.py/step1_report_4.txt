  "anomalies": [
    "Use of base32 encoding segments and DNS resolution of pseudo-hostnames that do not appear to serve legitimate purposes",

    "Recurrent attempt to resolve generated hostnames, possibly for covert data exfiltration",

    "Obfuscated data encoding schemes for data exfiltration"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code gathers extensive system and environment information, including hostname, environment variables, and external IP. It encodes and compresses this data, then transmits it via HTTP POST to a fixed IP address. It also generates pseudo-hostnames and attempts DNS resolution, which could serve as covert channels or command-and-control signals. The use of subprocess to run 'git config user.email' suggests data collection rather than legitimate purpose. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors consistent with data exfiltration or command-and-control mechanisms, with no clear user-initiated functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for covert data collection and transmission to a remote server, with suspicious DNS resolution and encoding techniques. These behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent related to system spying or exfiltration, despite no direct malware payloads.",
