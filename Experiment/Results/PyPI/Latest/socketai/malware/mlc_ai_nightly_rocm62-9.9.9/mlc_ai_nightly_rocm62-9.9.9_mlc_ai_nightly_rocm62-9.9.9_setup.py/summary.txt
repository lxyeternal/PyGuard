  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high-risk pattern by executing external code during installation, which can be malicious. While the actual behavior of 'main' is unknown, this pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks. The scores in reports are consistent with this risk. Further investigation into 'pipofftheoldblock.run.main' is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this package."
