  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'web3node', defining metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'web3node/__init__.py' using regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, external effects, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads version from local file; calls setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex for version extraction; dependencies include 'pyinstaller' and 'pynput', which are common but powerful tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with straightforward logic. No dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The regex-based version extraction could be manipulated if the source file is malicious, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious. Dependencies are common and benign within this context. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0 and 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The minor security concerns related to dependencies and regex extraction are theoretical and do not indicate actual malicious intent. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low security risk (~0.1), are appropriate and justified.",
