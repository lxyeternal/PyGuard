  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the web3node Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from web3node/__init__.py; reads setup parameters and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or execution based on external input.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from the package's __init__.py, then passes static parameters to setup() without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version info, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: importing setup tools, extracting version info via regex, and invoking setup() with package metadata. No external data or inputs beyond file reading are involved. The dependencies listed are common and do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
