{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'web3node' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from 'web3node/__init__.py'; importing setup functions from setuptools or distutils; static data in 'package_data'; list of dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None of the sources are used in a way that leads to data leakage, code execution, or external effect. The code only reads files and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> uses setup() to define package parameters -> installs dependencies. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward, with standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to extract version information from 'web3node/__init__.py' using regex, then calls setup() to prepare package installation. It includes a fallback import for setup from setuptools or distutils. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, or obfuscated code. The dependencies listed are common for such packages, with no indication of malicious intent. The code structure is typical for a Python setup script, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
