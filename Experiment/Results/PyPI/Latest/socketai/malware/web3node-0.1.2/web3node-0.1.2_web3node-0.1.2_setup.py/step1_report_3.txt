{
  "purpose": "To set up the 'web3node' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__version__' variable from 'web3node/__init__.py' file.",
  "sinks": "None directly related to untrusted data or potentially harmful operations.",
  "flows": "Reading the version from the file and passing package data and dependencies into 'setup()' function; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 're.search' to extract version info; dependencies include 'pyinstaller' and 'pynput', which are benign in the context of a setup script but should be noted for their potential misuse if misused elsewhere. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup operations. It extracts the version string from a source file using regex, which is a common pattern. The dependencies listed are standard for such a package, including tools like 'pyinstaller' and 'pynput', but their presence alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code. No network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is evident. The primary concern might be the inclusion of 'pyinstaller' and 'pynput' as dependencies, which could be used maliciously outside this script, but within this context, no malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs typical operations for packaging a Python library and does not contain malware or security risks within its scope.",
