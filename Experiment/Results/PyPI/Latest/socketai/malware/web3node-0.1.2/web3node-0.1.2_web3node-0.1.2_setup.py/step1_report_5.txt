{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the 'web3node' Python package, used to package and distribute the module.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'web3node/__init__.py' using regex; reads files in 'web3node/data/' directory.",
  "sinks": "None directly related to untrusted data; setup parameters do not involve handling untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version info dynamically, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The included 'install_requires' lists dependencies, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The list of dependencies includes 'pyinstaller', but this is common for packaging and does not imply malicious use.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to read the package version dynamically from the package's '__init__.py' file, then proceeds to call 'setup()' with package details. It imports 'setuptools' or 'distutils' for packaging, which is standard. No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious activities are present. The dependencies listed are typical for a web3 node implementation, and no code acts on untrusted input or exfiltrates data. The use of regex for version extraction is straightforward and not malicious. Overall, this is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious activity.",
