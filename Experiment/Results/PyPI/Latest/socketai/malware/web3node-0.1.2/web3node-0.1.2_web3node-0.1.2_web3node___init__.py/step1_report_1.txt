{
  "purpose": "Define version information and import platform-specific modules for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reading static variables (__version__, version_info, __all__) and importing modules from local package (.darwin, .win32, .gnu).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could leak or cause harm; the code primarily imports modules and defines variables.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; only static data assignment and module imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard patterns for package setup and platform detection.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes version information and an export list. It then imports all contents from three platform-specific modules. There is no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network or system calls. The import statements are straightforward and typical for a multi-platform Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for a cross-platform Python package, setting version info and importing platform-specific modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
