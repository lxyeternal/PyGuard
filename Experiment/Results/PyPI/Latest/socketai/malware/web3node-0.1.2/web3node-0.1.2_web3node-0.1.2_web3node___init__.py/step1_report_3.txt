  "purpose": "Define version information and import platform-specific modules for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version info, version string, list of exports, and import statements for local modules.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or insecure operations present.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard module initialization code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets static version variables and specifies module exports. It then imports three local modules: darwin, win32, and gnu. There is no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network operations. All imports are local, and the code performs straightforward initialization tasks typical for a cross-platform Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package setup code without any malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or malware indicators are present.",
