  "purpose": "Defines version info, export list, and imports platform-specific modules for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "sources": "Static variables (__version__, version_info), import statements for local modules (.darwin, .win32, .gnu).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only sets variables and imports modules without dynamic or external data.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static setup code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initialization script for a cross-platform Python package. It sets version variables, defines an export list, and imports platform-specific modules statically. There are no dynamic operations, data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for package setup, and free from malicious behavior or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation.",
