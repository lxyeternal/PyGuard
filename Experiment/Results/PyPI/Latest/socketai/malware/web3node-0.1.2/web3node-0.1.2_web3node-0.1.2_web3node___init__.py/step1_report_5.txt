  "purpose": "Define version information and import platform-specific modules for conditional functionality",
  "sources": "Assignment of version tuple, string, and list; import statements for modules darwin, win32, gnu",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; import statements load internal modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module version declaration and imports",
  "analysis": "The code declares a version tuple and string, sets an __all__ list for exports, then imports all contents from platform-specific modules darwin, win32, and gnu. No dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, no external data handling, and no obfuscated code are present. The imports are standard for modular platform-specific code, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module setup for cross-platform compatibility. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
