  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is straightforward: defines version info, an export list, and imports platform-specific modules.\n- No dynamic code execution, no user input processing, no network or file operations.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard for cross-platform Python packages.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious logic.\n- The import statements are static and local, with no signs of code injection or remote code execution.\n- The version variables are static and do not influence control flow or security.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n1. **Malware score:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Obfuscated score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n3. **Risk score:**\n   - All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is a typical initialization script with no security implications.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n- The only possible concern could be if the imported modules themselves are malicious, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. Based solely on this code, the risk remains zero.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is benign, standard package setup code for cross-platform modules, with no security risks or malicious behavior evident.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nIt aligns with the reports' findings.",
