  "purpose": "Define version information and import platform-specific modules for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Constant variables (__version__, version_info), import statements importing modules darwin, win32, gnu.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no output or external data handling, no network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version variables and imports platform-specific modules using straightforward import statements. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data leaks, or malicious logic. The code appears to be a standard module initialization segment for a cross-platform Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for a Python package's platform-specific imports. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
