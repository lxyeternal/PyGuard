  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'logax' Python library, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description, package discovery via find_packages(), static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations detected.",
  "flows": "Data read from README.md flows into long_description; static configuration data flows into package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures, including reading a README file and specifying dependencies. It uses well-known libraries and straightforward configuration without any dynamic code execution, obfuscated elements, or malicious behavior. There are no sources of untrusted input beyond reading a static file, and no sensitive data handling or network operations are performed within this script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
