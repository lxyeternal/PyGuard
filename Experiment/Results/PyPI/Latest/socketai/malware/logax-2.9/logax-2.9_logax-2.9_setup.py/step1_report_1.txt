  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library named 'logax'.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; no untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function parameters that influence package metadata and dependencies; no data leaks or unsafe actions are performed.",
  "flows": "N/A - setup configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, reads a README file for long description, and defines package metadata. There are no input validation issues, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors. The dependencies listed ('requests' and 'pybase64') are common and do not indicate malicious intent. The script follows typical packaging conventions without obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior, no security risks detected.",
