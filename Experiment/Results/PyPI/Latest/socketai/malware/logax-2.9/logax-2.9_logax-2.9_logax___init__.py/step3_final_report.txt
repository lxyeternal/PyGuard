  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'info' module, potentially to access its functions or variables.",
  "sources": "The relative import statement from .info import *",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or execute malicious code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the import only loads symbols into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious definitions; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement importing all symbols from the 'info' module. It does not execute any code or perform data processing. The security implications depend entirely on the content of 'info', which is unknown. The use of 'import *' is discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The risk score is low (around 0.2), considering the potential for hidden malicious code if 'info' is untrusted. Overall, the code is benign in isolation, with the primary concern being the trustworthiness of the 'info' module.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module. The use of 'import *' warrants caution but is not malicious by itself. The security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero.",
