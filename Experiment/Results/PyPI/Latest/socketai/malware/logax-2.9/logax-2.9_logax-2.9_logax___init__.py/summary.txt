  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module. The use of 'import *' warrants caution but is not malicious by itself. The security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero."
