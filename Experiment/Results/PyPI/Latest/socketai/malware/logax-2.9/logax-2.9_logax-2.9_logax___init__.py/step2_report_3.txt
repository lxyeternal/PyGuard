  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code is a simple relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module.\n- No active code execution, data processing, or suspicious operations are present.\n- The import statement itself is syntactically correct and common in Python packages.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify that 'from .info import *' is discouraged due to namespace pollution, but they emphasize that it is not inherently malicious.\n- They acknowledge that without inspecting 'info', the security implications cannot be fully assessed.\n- Some reports mention potential risks if 'info' contains malicious code, which is valid, but they do not specify that the import alone does not execute any code beyond loading symbols.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code not executing malicious operations directly.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.3), which seems reasonable given the minimal code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct as the code is straightforward.\n- Confidence levels vary between 0.5 and 0.9, reflecting uncertainty about 'info' content.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.3, which is appropriate.\n- The overall risk is low because the code does not perform any active malicious actions.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- Since the code only imports symbols and does not execute any code or perform data operations, malware score should remain at 0 unless 'info' contains malicious code, which cannot be determined here.\n- The reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly note that the security implications depend on the content of 'info'.\n- They avoid making unwarranted claims about malicious behavior solely based on the import statement.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis, reflecting minimal risk and no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.3 (consistent with low but non-zero potential risk if 'info' is malicious)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe import statement itself is benign and standard. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. The reports are accurate in their cautious approach.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (assuming the module is benign, but with potential if 'info' is malicious)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe in isolation. The security risk hinges entirely on the content of 'info', which is outside the scope of this snippet. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.",
