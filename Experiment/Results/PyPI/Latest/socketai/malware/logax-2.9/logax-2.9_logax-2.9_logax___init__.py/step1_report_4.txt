  "purpose": "Imports all contents from a module named 'info' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.info'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow within this statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can be considered risky because it imports all symbols from the module, which can hide malicious or unwanted code. However, on its own, this is a common pattern and not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple relative import that brings all variables, functions, or classes from the 'info' module into the current namespace. There is no indication of malicious behavior or anomalies within this single import statement. It does not execute any code or perform any data handling. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to identify malicious intent from this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "The line is a standard import statement using relative import syntax. No malicious activity is evident in this fragment. However, the use of 'import *' can sometimes obscure what is being imported, which could potentially hide malicious code if present in 'info', but that cannot be determined from this single line.",
