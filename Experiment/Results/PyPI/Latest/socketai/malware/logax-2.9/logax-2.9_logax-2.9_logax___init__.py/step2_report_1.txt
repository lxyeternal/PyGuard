  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\nAll five reports describe the same code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n**Key points from each report:**\n\n- The import is a relative wildcard import from a local module `info`.\n- No active code execution, data processing, or explicit sinks are present.\n- The primary concern is the use of `import *`, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code.\n- The content of the `info` module is unknown; therefore, the security implications depend heavily on its contents.\n- The confidence levels vary from 0.5 to 0.9, but all agree that the code itself is minimal and not inherently malicious.\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, indicating no evidence of malicious behavior from the snippet alone.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet exists as reported. It is a simple import statement.\n- **Malicious code:** There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic in the import statement itself.\n- **Use of `import *`:** While discouraged due to potential namespace pollution and hiding of imported symbols, it is not inherently malicious.\n- **Potential risks:** The main concern is the content of `info`. If `info` contains malicious code, then importing everything could introduce security issues. But the import statement alone does not execute code beyond namespace inclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring and Reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score:** Given no evidence of malicious code, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation is present, so this should stay at 0.\n- **Risk score:** The overall security risk is low but not zero if `info` is untrusted. The current scores (ranging from 0.1 to 0.3) seem reasonable, but considering the potential for hidden malicious code in `info`, a cautious approach would assign a slightly higher risk if the source of `info` is untrusted.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports are generally reasonable, given the minimal code.\n- The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the `info` module rather than the import statement itself.\n- To improve security, avoid wildcard imports in production code, especially from untrusted modules.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based solely on the provided code snippet:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 to 0.3 (low, but dependent on `info` content)\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (considering potential risks if `info` is malicious or untrusted)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, standard import statement with no immediate signs of malicious activity. The main concern is the trustworthiness of the `info` module, which cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. The scores in the reports are reasonable, but a conservative approach would keep the malware and obfuscated scores at zero and assign a low but non-zero risk score.",
