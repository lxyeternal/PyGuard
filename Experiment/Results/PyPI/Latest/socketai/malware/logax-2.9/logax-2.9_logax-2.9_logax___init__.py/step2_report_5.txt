  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement; no malicious code is evident.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** None in the code snippet itself; the concern about the 'info' module's content is valid but cannot be assessed here.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2. These seem reasonable given the minimal code.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Low, as no active malicious behavior is shown.\n- **Overall:** No issues; low security risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, a straightforward import.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Use of 'import *' can be risky for code clarity and potential hiding of malicious code, but the snippet itself is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. Slightly lower risk score, which seems appropriate.\n- **Overall:** No immediate threat, just a note on best practices.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same import pattern; potential concern due to 'import *'.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The concern about hiding malicious code is valid but cannot be confirmed here.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.3. Slightly higher risk, justified by the potential for hidden issues.\n- **Overall:** No direct malicious activity, but warrants caution if 'info' is untrusted.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Use of 'import *' can obscure what's imported.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Overall:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same import pattern.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The use of wildcard import again raises concerns about obscuring malicious code, but no evidence here.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Overall:** No direct malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet's simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All zero, which is reasonable; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting the potential risks associated with wildcard imports, especially if the 'info' module is untrusted.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The core issue is the use of `from .info import *`. While common in some codebases, it can hide malicious code if 'info' contains malicious definitions. However, in this isolated snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent across reports.\n- The confidence levels are high where the code is straightforward, and lower where potential risks are noted.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (a balanced value considering the potential for hidden issues in 'info', but no evidence here)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple import statement with no immediate security issues. The primary concern is the potential risk introduced by importing all symbols from an external module, which should be reviewed in the context of the 'info' module's trustworthiness.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If the 'info' module is from an untrusted source, the risk could be higher. Without access to its content, the best practice is to treat such wildcard imports cautiously.",
