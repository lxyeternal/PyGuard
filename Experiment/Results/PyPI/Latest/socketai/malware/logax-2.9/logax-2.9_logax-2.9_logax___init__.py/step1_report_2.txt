{
  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from the 'info' module in the same package, likely to use its functions, classes, or variables.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.info'",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data processing or output occurs in this snippet",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow is visible in this single line",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can be risky as it imports everything from the module, potentially overwriting existing identifiers, but it is common practice and not inherently malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement that includes all contents from the 'info' module in the current package. It does not execute any logic or data processing by itself. Without additional context or code, there are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The minimal code suggests straightforward functionality, possibly for configuration or informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard and unremarkable, assuming the 'info' module is benign.",
