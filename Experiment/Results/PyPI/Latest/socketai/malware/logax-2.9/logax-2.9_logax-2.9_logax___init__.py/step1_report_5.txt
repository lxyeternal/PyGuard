{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols and definitions from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module from the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this line; it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this single line; it's an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; the only notable aspect is the use of a wildcard import which can hide imported contents but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports all contents from the local 'info' module. Wildcard imports can obscure the actual imported objects, which may hide malicious or unwanted code if the 'info' module contains malicious definitions. However, without inspecting the 'info' module itself, no malicious behavior can be confirmed from this line alone. The line itself is not malicious but potentially problematic for code clarity and security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The line performs a standard import operation with no direct malicious behavior. Potential concerns relate to the contents of 'info', but based solely on this line, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
