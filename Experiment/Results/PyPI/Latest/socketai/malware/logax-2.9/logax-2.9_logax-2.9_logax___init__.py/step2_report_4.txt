  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their implications:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue Present?** Yes, the code is a simple import statement (`from .info import *`). It is syntactically correct and common in Python packages.\n- **Malicious Code?** No, the import statement itself does not contain malicious code. The risk depends on the content of 'info'.\n- **Obfuscation?** No.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, which aligns with the analysis. The report correctly notes that without access to 'info', we cannot determine maliciousness.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 seems reasonable given the minimal code and low likelihood of malicious activity solely from the import statement.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; the code is low risk unless 'info' contains malicious code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue Present?** Same as above; a straightforward import.\n- **Malicious Code?** No evidence in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscation?** No.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is appropriate; very low risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign based on this snippet.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue Present?** Same import pattern.\n- **Malicious Code?** Cannot be determined without 'info'.\n- **Obfuscation?** No.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 might be slightly higher, but given the potential for 'import *' to hide malicious code, it’s justifiable to assign a moderate risk. Still, without evidence, it remains low.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable, but perhaps a slightly conservative risk score is acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue Present?** Same import statement.\n- **Malicious Code?** No.\n- **Obfuscation?** No.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue Present?** Same import pattern.\n- **Malicious Code?** No direct evidence.\n- **Obfuscation?** No.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 seems appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple relative import with no inherent malicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the code snippet.\n- The risk scores are generally low, reflecting the minimal risk from this code alone, with some reports assigning slightly higher scores due to the potential risk of 'import *' hiding malicious code in 'info'.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The actual security risk hinges on the content of the 'info' module, which is unknown here.\n- The use of 'import *' is discouraged in best practices but is not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation or active malicious behavior are present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Keep at 0 unless the 'info' module is known to be malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Maintain low, around 0.1–0.2, unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n**Summary:** The code snippet is benign in isolation. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects the minimal risk posed by this import statement alone.",
