{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the contents of the 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet, but imported code could contain sinks.",
  "flows": "Potential flow from 'info' module to the current namespace; no data flows explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' can be suspicious due to wildcard import hiding imported content, which may include malicious code or obscure behaviors.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import of all symbols from a module named 'info'. Since the module's content is not shown, the security of the imported code cannot be assessed directly. The import statement itself is a common practice but can be used maliciously to conceal harmful code or backdoors if 'info' contains such code. No other code or logic is present to analyze for malicious behavior. The snippet alone is minimal but warrants caution if 'info' is untrusted or unknown.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement; its security implications depend entirely on the contents of the 'info' module. The use of 'import *' can be risky if 'info' contains malicious code. Without further context, the overall security risk remains indeterminate but should be reviewed in conjunction with the 'info' module.",
