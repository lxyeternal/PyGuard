{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the only source, which loads data or functions from 'info'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if 'info' contains malicious code, but the import itself is not an active sink.",
  "flows": "Data or code flows from 'info' module into the current module upon import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' is often discouraged as it can hide imported symbols and reduce code clarity; however, it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement utilizing relative import syntax to import all symbols from 'info'. This is a common pattern in Python packages for modular organization. Without access to the 'info' module's content, it is impossible to determine if it contains malicious code or hidden backdoors. The import does not perform any active operations or data processing itself. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is apparent in this fragment. Given its minimal nature, the code appears standard but incomplete for a full security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. Its security risk is low, assuming the 'info' module itself is safe. Without additional context or content of 'info', there is no evidence of malicious intent or malware.",
