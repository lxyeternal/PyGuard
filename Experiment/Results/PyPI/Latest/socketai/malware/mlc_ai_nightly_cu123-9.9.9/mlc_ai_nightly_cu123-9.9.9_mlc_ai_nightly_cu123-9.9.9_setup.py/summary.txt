  "conclusion": "The code pattern is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it executes external code during package installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. The behavior warrants high suspicion and further investigation of the imported module. The current scores are reasonable but could be slightly increased to reflect the high potential risk."
