  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, file operations, package setup scripts, and input data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, file modifications, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, files) to sinks (network, file system, execution points).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no signs of malware or obfuscation. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious patterns. Security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal potential risk, though slightly conservative. Confidence levels are high for code-based reports (0.9), and low for reports without code (0.2–0). Minor adjustments to risk scores could better reflect the benign nature, specifically lowering from 0.2 to 0.1 for setup scripts. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, with minor room for lowering the risk score in some cases. No significant security concerns are identified.",
