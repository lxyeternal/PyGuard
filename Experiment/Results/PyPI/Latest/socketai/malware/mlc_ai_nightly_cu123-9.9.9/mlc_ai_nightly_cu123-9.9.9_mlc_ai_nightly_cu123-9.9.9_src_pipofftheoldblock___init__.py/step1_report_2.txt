  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific data processing or system task, but without the actual code content, the exact intent cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, or data files, but specifics are not provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network communications, file writes, or system commands, but details are missing.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to sinks could occur through function calls or data manipulation, but the actual flow is unknown without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without viewing the code, but potential red flags include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior patterns.",
  "analysis": "Unable to perform detailed analysis due to lack of code. Without source code content, we cannot identify data sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies. The review is limited to the assumption that standard Python packages and coding practices are used.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine malicious intent or security risks. The code appears standard, but a detailed review of the actual code content is necessary to identify any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
