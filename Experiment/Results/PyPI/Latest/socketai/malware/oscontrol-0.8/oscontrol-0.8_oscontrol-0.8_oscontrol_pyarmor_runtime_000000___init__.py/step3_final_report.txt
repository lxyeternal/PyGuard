{
  "purpose": "This code imports the __pyarmor__ runtime from a local module, indicating it is part of a protected or obfuscated package using Pyarmor.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime and the comment indicating Pyarmor version and trial status.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or external data sinks are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply imports a module related to obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the comment indicating a trial version and expiration date, which is typical for protected code but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a protected runtime module, accompanied by comments about Pyarmor version and trial status. No suspicious functions, data flows, or network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, low risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with the benign and obfuscation-related nature of the code. The high obfuscation score in some reports reflects the protected status, but given the simplicity of the snippet, it is acceptable. The absence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity indicates this is a benign component of an obfuscated package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign part of an obfuscated or protected package, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
