{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ object from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or runtime protection.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime imports code from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is only importing a module.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version comment indicating trial software and a timestamp, which may be used for license or obfuscation purposes. The import of __pyarmor__ suggests obfuscation or licensing mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a specific object from a local module named pyarmor_runtime. The comment indicates this is related to Pyarmor version 9.0.6, a known obfuscation tool. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic detected. The import and comment suggest the code is part of a protected or obfuscated package, possibly used to prevent reverse engineering.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of an obfuscation or licensing scheme using Pyarmor. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The presence of the import and comment is consistent with code protected by Pyarmor, not malicious activity.",
