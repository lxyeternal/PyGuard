  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the provided code",
  "flows": "No data flow paths within this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating use of Pyarmor with trial license; no malicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named __pyarmor__ from a relative package, which is typical for obfuscated or protected code using Pyarmor. The comment suggests this is part of a protected or licensed script. There are no suspicious functions, hardcoded credentials, or network activity. The code is minimal and serves as a runtime import for obfuscation, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement associated with Pyarmor protection, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
