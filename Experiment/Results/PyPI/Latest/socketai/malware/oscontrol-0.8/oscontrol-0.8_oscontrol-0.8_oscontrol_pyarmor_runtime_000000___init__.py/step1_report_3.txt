{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime protection or obfuscation handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks",
  "flows": "No data flows observed, as the code only performs an import",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a trial version comment and timestamp; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; minimal code content",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module, likely part of a code obfuscation or protection framework (Pyarmor). The comment indicates it's a trial version. No malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not handle any data or perform actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement related to Pyarmor runtime protection. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code fragment.",
