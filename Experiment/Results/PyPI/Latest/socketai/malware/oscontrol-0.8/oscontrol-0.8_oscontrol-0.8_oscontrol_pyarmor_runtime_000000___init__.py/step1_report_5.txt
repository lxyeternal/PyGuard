{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating Pyarmor trial version and expiration date, which is unusual in open-source code but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement for a module named __pyarmor__ from a relative package. The comment suggests that this is part of a Pyarmor obfuscated or protected package, possibly for licensing or licensing enforcement. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected. The presence of a trial version comment is atypical but not malicious; it indicates licensing status. No flow of untrusted data or malicious actions identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement associated with Pyarmor, likely used for code obfuscation or licensing. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
