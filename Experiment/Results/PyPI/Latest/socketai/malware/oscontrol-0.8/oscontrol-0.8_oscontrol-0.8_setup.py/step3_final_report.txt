  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, include_package_data, description, author, python_requires, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external input processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, no input handling, no network operations, no obfuscation, no secrets, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup.py script that uses setuptools to define package metadata. It contains no dynamic elements, no user input, no network or filesystem operations, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The reasoning is consistent and accurate, reflecting the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The scores are appropriate and align with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a legitimate, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
