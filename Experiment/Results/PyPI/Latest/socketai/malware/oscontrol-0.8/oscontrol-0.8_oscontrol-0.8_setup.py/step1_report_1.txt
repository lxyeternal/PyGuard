{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'oscontrol' Python package, including metadata and package discovery settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, author, description, and requirements; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted destinations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script is a static configuration file.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the standard 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup' function with static parameters for package configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, no user input handling, and no network or filesystem operations. The metadata provided is typical for a Python package setup. No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected based on this code.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a straightforward, legitimate package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
