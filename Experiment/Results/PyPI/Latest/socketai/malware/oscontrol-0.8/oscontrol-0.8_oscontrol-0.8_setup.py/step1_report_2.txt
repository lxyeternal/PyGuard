  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of the 'oscontrol' Python library.",
  "sources": "The script reads package metadata and configuration parameters, including package discovery via find_packages() and static strings for name, version, description, author, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute or handle untrusted data are present. The script does not perform any data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static configuration parameters into the setup() function. There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with static strings and a package discovery method. It specifies the required Python version and package classifiers. No external inputs or dynamic code execution are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py file appears to be a standard package configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical setup operations without any suspicious or harmful features.",
