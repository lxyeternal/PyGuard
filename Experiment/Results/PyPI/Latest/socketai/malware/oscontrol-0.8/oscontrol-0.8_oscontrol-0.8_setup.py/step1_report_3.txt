  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, version, packages, include_package_data, description, author, python_requires, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code is solely for packaging configuration and does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not process data or execute untrusted input flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard for a setup.py script; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines a package configuration for 'oscontrol'. It specifies package data, metadata, compatibility, and licensing information. The code is static and contains no input handling, code execution, or network operations. All elements follow typical setup.py patterns with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or security risks detected in this code.",
