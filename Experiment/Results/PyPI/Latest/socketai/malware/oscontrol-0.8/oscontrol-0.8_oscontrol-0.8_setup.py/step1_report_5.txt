  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'oscontrol' Python library.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools (setup, find_packages), setup() function parameters",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code only defines package metadata and configuration",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; configuration values are static and predefined",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script used for packaging a Python library. It imports setup utilities, defines package metadata such as name, version, author, description, Python version requirement, and classifiers. All values are static and typical for such scripts. No dynamic execution, input handling, or suspicious behavior is present. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py code appears to be a normal, benign packaging script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
