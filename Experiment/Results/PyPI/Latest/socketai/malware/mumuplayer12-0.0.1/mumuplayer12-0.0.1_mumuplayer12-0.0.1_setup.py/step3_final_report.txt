  "purpose": "Static package setup configuration for the 'mumuplayer12' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings defining package name, version, author, description, and package list.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The description field is set to 'None' as a string, which is unusual but benign; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup script with no dynamic input, external communication, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level of 1 is justified given the straightforward, standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
