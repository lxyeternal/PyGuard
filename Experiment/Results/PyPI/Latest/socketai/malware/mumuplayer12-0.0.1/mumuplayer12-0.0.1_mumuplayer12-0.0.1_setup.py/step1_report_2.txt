  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'mumuplayer12' Python module.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; the code only defines static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code does not process external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code is purely declarative setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. The code uses standard setuptools setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with static arguments defining package name, version, author, description, and packages. There are no dynamic elements, user inputs, environment variables, or external data interactions. It appears to be a straightforward package setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module named 'mumuplayer12'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
