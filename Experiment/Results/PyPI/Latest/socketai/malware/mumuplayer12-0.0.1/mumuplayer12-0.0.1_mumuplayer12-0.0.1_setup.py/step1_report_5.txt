  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'mumuplayer12' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function: name, version, author, description, packages.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic or untrusted input sources are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to critical points; all data is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The description field is set to 'None' as a string, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code is minimal and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward use of setuptools to configure a package. No input/output, external data processing, or dynamic code execution occurs. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. The code is simple and adheres to typical package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package setup code with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
