  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'mumuplayer12' Python package",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; uses static strings for package metadata",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; only static assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple setup configuration with static values",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard use of setuptools' setup function to define package metadata. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive information are present. The package metadata appears benign, with typical fields like name, version, author, description, and packages. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
