{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'mumuplayer12' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from setuptools import setup' and the setup() function call with package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function parameters primarily handle package metadata; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import of setuptools module leads directly to execution of setup() with static metadata; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for package setup. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a well-known packaging library and calls setup() with static, benign metadata such as package name, version, author, and description. There are no dynamic inputs, no code injection, no network operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The package appears to be a simple setup configuration for a Python package named 'mumuplayer12'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It only defines package metadata for distribution purposes.",
