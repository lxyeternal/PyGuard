      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant security risk. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main.py', the pattern itself warrants high suspicion and caution. The scores across reports are generally appropriate, but a slightly higher malware score is justified given the behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior consistent with covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, posing privacy and security risks. While it does not contain active malicious payloads, its purpose aligns with malicious or tracking activities. The malware score is approximately 0.4, and the security risk score is around 0.7, reflecting significant privacy concerns and potential malicious intent."
