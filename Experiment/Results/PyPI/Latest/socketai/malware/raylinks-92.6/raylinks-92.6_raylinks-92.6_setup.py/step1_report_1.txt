{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'raylinks' Python package, including a custom install command that executes a function after installation.",
  "sources": "The custom 'run' method in 'CrazyInstallStrat' imports and executes 'main' from 'main' module after installation.",
  "sinks": "The 'main' function from 'main' module, which could perform arbitrary actions when invoked.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main' module, which may execute code with potentially untrusted or malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code ('from main import main; main()') post-installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard setup process with dependencies. The notable element is the custom 'CrazyInstallStrat' class, which extends 'install' and overrides 'run()' to execute 'main()' from 'main' module after installation. This pattern can be used to execute arbitrary code upon package installation, posing a security risk if 'main' contains malicious code. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected. Usage of third-party dependencies ('requests', 'psutil') is standard. The code's primary suspicious feature is the execution of external code ('main()') during install, which could be malicious if 'main' is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a potentially malicious pattern of executing code ('main()') immediately after installation, which could be exploited to run arbitrary code on the user's system. This is a common technique in malicious package supply chains. While the code structure is standard otherwise, the post-install execution warrants suspicion.",
