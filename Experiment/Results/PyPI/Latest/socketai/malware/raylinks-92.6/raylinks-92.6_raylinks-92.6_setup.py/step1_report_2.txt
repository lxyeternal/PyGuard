  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'raylinks' Python package, including a custom installation step that executes a function from main.py.",
  "sources": "The custom 'run' method in CrazyInstallStrat class which imports and executes 'main()' from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' from main.py during install, potential if 'main()' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "Installation process triggers 'CrazyInstallStrat.run()', which then imports and executes 'main()' from main.py.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code ('main()') during setup, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that runs the standard install process and then imports and executes 'main()' from main.py. This behavior could be used to run arbitrary code post-installation, which is suspicious. However, without inspecting main.py, we cannot confirm malicious intent. The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or network activity. The malicious activity depends entirely on the contents of main.py, which is external to this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign but includes a potentially malicious behavior by executing 'main()' during installation. The risk hinges on what 'main()' does; if 'main()' contains malicious code, this could be a supply chain attack. Without examining main.py, the risk remains uncertain but warrants caution.",
