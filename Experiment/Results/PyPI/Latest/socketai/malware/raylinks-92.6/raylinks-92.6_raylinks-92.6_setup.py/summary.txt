  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant security risk. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main.py', the pattern itself warrants high suspicion and caution. The scores across reports are generally appropriate, but a slightly higher malware score is justified given the behavior."
