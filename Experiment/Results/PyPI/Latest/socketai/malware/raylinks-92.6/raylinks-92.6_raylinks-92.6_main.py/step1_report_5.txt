{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to specific external URLs encoded in Base64.",
  "sources": "Input sources include platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), platform.system(), subprocess outputs, and MAC address retrieval functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs constructed with encoded MAC addresses and other parameters.",
  "flows": "System information is gathered, encoded, and then transmitted via constructed URLs to remote servers, potentially leaking sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes MAC addresses in Base64 and transmits them to multiple suspicious-looking domains without user consent. No validation or user notification. The URLs are non-standard, possibly malicious. The exception handling silently ignores errors, potentially hiding malicious activity. No clear legitimate purpose for data collection is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across different OS. It encodes MAC addresses in Base64 and sends them as URL parameters to third-party URLs. The URLs appear suspicious and may be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not prompt user consent nor indicates a legitimate purpose. The silent exception handling may hide malfeasance. No suspicious code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected; however, the data collection and transmission behavior are concerning for privacy violations and potential malicious data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system identifiers and sending them to external, suspicious domains without user consent. While no direct malicious payloads like malware, backdoors, or destructive actions are evident, the behavior aligns with potential tracking or data theft activity. Due to the suspicious URLs and covert data transmission, this code should be treated with caution.",
