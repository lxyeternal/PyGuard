  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs with query parameters containing system info.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded and included as URL parameters, then sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names, encoding MAC addresses in base64, and sending data without encryption or authentication. No data validation or response handling is implemented.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses via system commands. MAC addresses are base64-encoded. The code then constructs URLs with this data as query parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to potentially malicious or suspicious domains. The code does not verify the responses nor handle errors meaningfully, which can be used for covert data exfiltration. No other malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The domains appear suspicious and could be involved in data collection or malicious activities. Overall, the code acts as a basic info stealer with network communication to untrusted servers.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. It gathers identifiable system info and transmits it to external servers, which is typical of malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. The code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated, but the domain names and data exfiltration pattern are suspicious. It does not contain malware per se, but the behavior indicates potential malicious intent.",
