{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to multiple external URLs as URL parameters.",
  "sources": "Input sources include platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and system commands (getmac, ifconfig) for MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data (system info and encoded MAC addresses) is sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs, which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System information is gathered, encoded, and then appended as URL parameters in HTTP requests to the specified external domains.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious, as they do not belong to legitimate domains and may be part of command-and-control infrastructure. The code collects MAC addresses, encodes them, and transmits this info without user consent. The code does not handle responses or errors meaningfully. The use of random number in URL parameter could be to evade caching or track requests.",
  "analysis": "The script collects identifiable system data (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory), encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data to multiple suspicious external URLs via GET requests. No user prompts, input validation, or encryption beyond base64 encoding are present. The URLs are suspicious and could be used for tracking or data theft. The code operates silently without user awareness or consent. The network activity resembles beaconing behavior typical of malware or spyware trying to exfiltrate system information.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be performing data collection and transmission to suspicious external servers, likely for malicious or tracking purposes. The data collection is passive, and there is no indication of malicious commands being executed, but the behavior is suspicious given the external domains and data exfiltration pattern.",
