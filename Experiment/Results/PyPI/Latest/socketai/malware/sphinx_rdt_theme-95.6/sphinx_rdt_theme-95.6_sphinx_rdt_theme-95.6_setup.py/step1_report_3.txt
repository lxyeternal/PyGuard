{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that installs dependencies and executes a main function after installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method of the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class, which executes 'from main import main' and then calls 'main()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function imported from 'main' module executed during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code imports 'main' and executes 'main()', which could potentially run untrusted code at install time.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of 'main()' during the install process is unusual; no explicit safety checks or context provided for 'main()'.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after performing standard installation steps, imports and executes a function 'main()' from a local module. This behavior is atypical for setup scripts and can be used to execute arbitrary code during package installation. The package dependencies are benign ('requests', 'psutil'), but the execution of 'main()' at install time raises security concerns because it could run malicious or undesired code without user awareness. No suspicious obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are directly evident, but the behavior of executing arbitrary code at install time is a potential risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a 'main()' function from the 'main' module during installation, which could be malicious or unintended. This behavior warrants caution, as it can execute arbitrary code during package installation, posing security risks.",
