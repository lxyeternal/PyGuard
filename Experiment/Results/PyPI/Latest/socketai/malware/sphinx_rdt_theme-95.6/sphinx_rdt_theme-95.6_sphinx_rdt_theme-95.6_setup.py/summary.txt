  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing external code during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with a malware score around 0.65 and a security risk score around 0.8. Further investigation of 'main()' is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
