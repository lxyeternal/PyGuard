  "purpose": "Set up and install the Python package 'sphinx_rdt_theme' with a custom install step that executes a function from 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import of 'main' module and invocation of 'main()' within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'main' module during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method executes 'install.run(self)' and then calls 'main()' from 'main'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of executing an external 'main' function during package installation; no information on what 'main()' does, which could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script extends the standard setuptools 'install' command with a custom class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that calls 'main()' from an imported 'main' module after installation. This could be used to run arbitrary code during package installation. The code does not specify what 'main()' does, which raises suspicion as it could execute malicious or undesired actions. The package dependencies appear benign, but the invocation of 'main()' is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main()' performs harmful operations. The script does not contain hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The only anomaly is the execution of external code at install time without clarity on its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code introduces a potentially malicious behavior by executing an external 'main()' function during installation, which could run arbitrary or harmful code. Without knowledge of 'main()', this behavior is suspicious. Caution is advised, and further inspection of the 'main' module is recommended.",
