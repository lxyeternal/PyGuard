{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (host, user, current directory, MAC addresses), encode MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs as GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reading system details (platform.node, getpass.getuser, os.getcwd), retrieving MAC addresses via subprocess calls, and generating random numbers.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP GET requests to external URLs with collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from system info functions (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses) flows into URL parameter construction, then transmitted via urllib.request.urlopen to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs contacted are suspicious, potentially malicious or used for tracking. The code encodes MAC addresses in base64, possibly to obfuscate the data. The code does not validate or sanitize data before sending. No explicit user consent or visibility is shown.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses, and sends the data to external URLs under the guise of a normal process. The URLs are not standard and appear suspicious, indicating potential tracking or data exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding on MAC addresses may serve to obscure the data. The code does not include any explicit malicious actions like executing system commands beyond gathering info or executing malicious payloads, but the communication with suspicious URLs and data collection could be part of a malicious tracking or data theft operation.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system identifiers and transmits them to untrusted external servers, which raises privacy and security concerns. While it does not execute malicious payloads or destructive actions, its behavior aligns with potentially malicious data exfiltration or user tracking. The suspicious URLs and data encoding suggest a malicious or at least privacy-invasive intent.",
