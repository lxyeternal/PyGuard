  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses) and send it via HTTP GET requests to external URLs with encoded data.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading MAC addresses, URLs with parameters constructed using system data and base64-encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls with constructed URLs transmitting system information over the network.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses) is gathered, encoded, then included as URL parameters, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external domains with obfuscated or suspicious hostnames; collection and transmission of hardware identifiers (MAC addresses) encoded in base64; no user consent or obvious purpose for data exfiltration; silent network communication without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host-specific data such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses across different OS platforms. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends these details to several external URLs via GET requests, which could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or malicious data collection. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely malicious or obfuscated. There are no safeguards, user prompts, or encryption beyond basic base64 encoding. The code does not perform any harmful system modifications but silently transmits potentially sensitive system information, indicating possible malicious intent or spyware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is collecting detailed system info and sending it to external, suspicious domains without user consent, which is indicative of malicious or tracking behavior. While it does not execute destructive actions, its data exfiltration aspect is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
