  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading network interfaces), input parameters in URL (hostname, username, current path, MAC address).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) — sending data via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "flows": "Data from platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and MAC addresses are encoded and included as URL parameters, then sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded suspicious URLs (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun), base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and network requests to these URLs without any response handling or verification.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system identifiers such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs and sends HTTP GET requests to three external URLs with this data as URL parameters. The URLs are suspicious and may be used for tracking or exfiltration. The network requests are made without validation or response handling, suggesting possible covert data transmission. The code does not perform any destructive actions or malicious payloads but does engage in potentially privacy-invasive data exfiltration. The inclusion of specific, non-standard URLs indicates potential malicious intent or at least undesirable behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting user and system data and exfiltrating it to external servers, which is suspicious and could be malicious depending on context. There are no signs of destructive malware, but the data collection and transmission patterns are concerning for privacy and security. The overall security risk is moderate, leaning towards malicious behavior due to data exfiltration practices.",
