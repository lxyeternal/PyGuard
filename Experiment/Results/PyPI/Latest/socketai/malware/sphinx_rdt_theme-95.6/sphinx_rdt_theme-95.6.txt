      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing external code during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with a malware score around 0.65 and a security risk score around 0.8. Further investigation of 'main()' is recommended to confirm malicious intent."

While it lacks destructive payloads, its behavior resembles spyware or tracking malware. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this, with a malware score around 0.5-0.6 and a high security risk score (~0.7)."
