  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward static import statements.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?** No. The reasoning is sound; the fallback import pattern is common.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for scores:** Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, the scores are reasonable.\n- **Overall:** Confirmed benign. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, just extensive import statements with fallback.\n- **Errors, flaws?** No. The reasoning is correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation; the pattern is typical.\n- **Overall:** Benign, no adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same pattern of conditional imports.\n- **Errors, flaws?** No. The analysis correctly states no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0. Correct.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Overall:** Confirmed safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The extensive list of imports is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Errors, flaws?** No. The reasoning aligns with standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** No concerns; safe.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Same as above.\n- **Errors, flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n- **Overall:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, given the benign nature of static imports and fallback pattern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. There is no indication of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks in this code snippet. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
