{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import various functions from either the 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' libraries, which are utility libraries for functional programming in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements, specifically the libraries 'cytoolz' and 'toolz'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data or network operations.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statements; there are no evident data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically attempts to import from 'cytoolz', falling back to 'toolz' if the first import fails. This is a common pattern for compatibility but doesn't indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs conditional imports from two related Python libraries. This pattern is typical for ensuring compatibility or optional dependency fallback. No execution of untrusted code, no network activity, or data manipulation is present. The import list is extensive but standard for utility libraries, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The fallback mechanism is straightforward and not suspicious. The code does not interact with environment variables, files, or external systems beyond imports. Overall, it appears benign and intended for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility import block for utility libraries 'cytoolz' and 'toolz'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security risks. It is a standard pattern with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
