  "purpose": "Static import statements for utility functions from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' with fallback handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static imports only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; extensive list of utility functions is typical for such imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of numerous functions from 'cytoolz' with a fallback to 'toolz'. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation. The pattern is common for compatibility and utility setup. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident. The import list is large but consists of standard utility functions, and the fallback pattern is typical. The code's purpose appears to be setting up utility functions for use elsewhere, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing static imports of utility functions with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
