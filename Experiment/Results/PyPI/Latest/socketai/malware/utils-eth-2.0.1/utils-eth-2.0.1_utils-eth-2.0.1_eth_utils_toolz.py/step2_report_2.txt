  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the import code and the provided evaluations.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same pattern: extensive import statements from 'cytoolz' with fallback to 'toolz'.\n- The code is static, only importing functions, with no execution or data flow.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The fallback import pattern is common for compatibility and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code only performs static imports with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The reports do not point out any logical or security flaws; they simply interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The extensive list of imports might seem unusual but is typical for utility libraries.\n- The fallback pattern is standard and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code is present.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — correct.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate and well-reasoned.\n- No modifications needed; all evaluations are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code is a benign setup for utility functions, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is purely static import statements with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the reports correctly identify it as such. No further action or concern is warranted.",
