{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to convert Ethereum smart contract ABIs and signatures into their respective 4-byte selectors or log topics using Keccak hashing.",
  "sources": "Function parameters: abi dictionaries, event/signature strings; the keccak function import",
  "sinks": "Keccak hash function used for cryptographic hashing, returning bytes; no untrusted data sinks such as network or file writes",
  "flows": "Input data (ABIs, signatures) are processed and transformed via hashing functions, resulting in 4-byte or full hash outputs",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manipulates structured data representing smart contract ABIs, converting them into signatures and then hashes. The use of keccak hashing is standard for Ethereum-related operations. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. All operations are deterministic and predictable. The functions are simple and adhere to Ethereum standards, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for handling Ethereum ABI signatures and log topics, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of an Ethereum interaction library.",
