  "purpose": "Utility functions for encoding Ethereum smart contract ABIs into signatures and log topics, including conversion of tuple types and calculation of 4-byte selectors using keccak hash.",
  "sources": "The code reads ABI definitions (input dictionaries) and generates signatures and hash-based selectors.",
  "sinks": "Keccak hash functions are used to produce selectors and topics; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input ABI dictionaries are transformed into signature strings, which are then hashed to produce selectors/topics.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain any unusual or suspicious code constructs. It relies on a standard hashing library and standard string manipulations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code processes ABI definitions to generate function signatures and event signatures, then hashes them with keccak to produce selectors and log topics. It performs type checks, string manipulations, and uses a keccak hashing function. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious operations. The functions are straightforward utility conversions, with no external network or system modification activities. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for Ethereum ABI signature generation. It performs expected operations without any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
