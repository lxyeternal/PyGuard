{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate function and event signatures from ABI definitions and convert them into 4-byte selectors or log topics using keccak hashing.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input dictionaries representing ABI components, function, and event definitions.",
  "sinks": "Hashes are computed and returned as bytes; no data is sent externally or written to files, and no untrusted data is executed.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries are processed to generate signature strings, which are then hashed with keccak to produce selectors or topics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of keccak hashing is standard for Ethereum-related signature generation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads ABI data structures and processes them into signatures, applying string manipulations and hashing. It uses the 'keccak' function imported from a local module, which is typical for blockchain applications. No untrusted data flows into external systems, nor does it include malicious or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or malware signatures are evident. The code is clean, straightforward, and implements standard cryptographic signature generation procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard Ethereum ABI signature hashing functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and purpose-specific, with no suspicious anomalies.",
