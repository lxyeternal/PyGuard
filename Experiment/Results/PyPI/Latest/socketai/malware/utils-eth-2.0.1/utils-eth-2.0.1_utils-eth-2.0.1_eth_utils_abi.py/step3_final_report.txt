  "purpose": "Utility functions for Ethereum ABI signature and event topic generation using keccak hashing.",
  "sources": "ABI dictionaries ('type', 'components', 'name', 'inputs') and signature strings.",
  "sinks": "Hashing functions applied to signature strings and ABI components; no data sinks that leak data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "ABI data is processed through collapse_if_tuple to generate type signatures, then hashed with keccak to produce selectors or topics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with proper type checks and deterministic hashing. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Ethereum ABI signature and topic generation functions. It processes ABI data structures, converting tuples to string signatures, then hashes these signatures with keccak. The code performs input validation on 'type' fields but does not validate the entire ABI structure, which is typical for such utilities. No external network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution occurs. The keccak function is imported from a local module, assumed to be standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The functions are deterministic and align with Ethereum standards. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to processing potentially untrusted ABI data, which is inherent to blockchain tooling but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe utility for Ethereum ABI signature and topic generation. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified given the code's purpose and behavior.",
