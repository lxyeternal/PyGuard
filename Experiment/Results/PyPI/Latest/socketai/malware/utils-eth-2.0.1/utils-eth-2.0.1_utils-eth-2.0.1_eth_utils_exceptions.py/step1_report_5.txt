  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; class definition does not read input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output actions; class is a simple exception subclass.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this class does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic custom exception class named ValidationError that inherits from Exception. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no dynamic code constructs, no data processing, and no external interactions. The implementation is minimal and standard for defining custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception without any malicious behavior or security issues. It serves a clear purpose of signaling validation errors and does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements.",
