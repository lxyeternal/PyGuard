  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways as the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "The class is straightforward with no anomalies; it inherits from Exception with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class 'ValidationError' that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose and contains a 'pass' statement indicating no additional methods or attributes. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity. It is standard practice to define custom exceptions for validation purposes in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign class definition for a custom exception with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
