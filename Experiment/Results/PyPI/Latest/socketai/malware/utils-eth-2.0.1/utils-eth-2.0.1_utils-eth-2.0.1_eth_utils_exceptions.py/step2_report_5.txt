  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception (`ValidationError`) inheriting from `Exception`. There are no signs of external data handling, dynamic code execution, or other malicious activities. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.  \n- The reports appropriately conclude that the code is benign and serves a utility purpose.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence, and 0 for obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk. This is reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.  \n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- The reports assign a securityRisk of 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.  \n- No issues with the risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis**  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.  \n- The code contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis.  \n- No overinterpretation or speculation is present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Assessment and My Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward class definition for a custom exception, with no malicious or security concerns.  \n- The malware score should remain at 0.  \n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.  \n- The risk score should stay at 0, as there's no security risk.\n\n**Final Estimation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the assessments provided in the reports.",
