  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "Class definition; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class serves solely as an exception type.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal custom exception class 'ValidationError' inheriting from 'Exception' with a docstring and a pass statement. It is a standard pattern with no external data handling, dynamic code, or malicious behavior. The code is clear, simple, and serves a utility purpose. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or malicious actions. The overall assessment confirms the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward class definition for a custom validation error exception. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
