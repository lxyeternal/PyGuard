  "analysis": "The code simply declares a custom exception class 'ValidationError' inheriting from Exception, with a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no external data sources, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or network activity. The class is standard and minimal, serving as a specific exception type. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
