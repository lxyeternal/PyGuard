{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for applying formatters, key mappings, and conditional transformations on data structures such as lists and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (e.g., sequences, dicts, values) and user-supplied callables (formatters, conditions).",
  "sinks": "Executes user-supplied functions (formatters, conditions) which could potentially be malicious if untrusted; no external system calls or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through user-defined functions, with potential execution of untrusted code during formatter application or condition checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected; deprecation warnings are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of data transformation utilities that execute user-provided callables. It performs input validation and error handling correctly. No external I/O, network, or system modifications are present. The functions are straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The primary security concern is the execution of external functions, which is inherent to such utilities but not malicious in itself. The code is well-structured and free of vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for data formatting and transformation. No evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and minimal security risk (around 0.1-0.2) are justified. The main consideration is trusting the user-supplied functions, which is outside the scope of the code review.",
