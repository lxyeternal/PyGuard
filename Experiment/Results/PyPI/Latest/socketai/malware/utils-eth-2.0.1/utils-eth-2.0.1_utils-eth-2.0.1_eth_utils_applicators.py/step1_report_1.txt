{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for applying various formatting and transformation operations on sequences and dictionaries, such as applying formatters at specific indices, conditional formatting, key mapping, and combining formatters.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as sequences, dictionaries, and functions (conditions and formatters). No external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The code could potentially execute user-provided formatter functions and condition functions, which might contain malicious behavior if these are untrusted. However, the code itself does not contain network, file, or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (sequences, dictionaries, formatters, conditions) flow into functions that apply formatters or mappings, producing transformed data. No external sink like network or file operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains deprecation warnings, but no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are evident. All functions seem to perform legitimate data transformations. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are used beyond standard functional programming patterns.",
  "analysis": "The module is primarily focused on applying transformations and formatters to data structures. The functions invoke user-supplied callables, which could be malicious if untrusted, but this is typical for such utility functions. No network operations, file system access, or system calls are present. The code uses warnings, decorators, and functional composition, but none of these introduce security issues. The only potential concern is the execution of user-supplied functions, which is expected for a formatting utility; it does not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility module for data transformation with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for data transformation, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It executes user-supplied functions for formatting, which is standard and expected for such utilities. No malicious code or security risks are evident.",
