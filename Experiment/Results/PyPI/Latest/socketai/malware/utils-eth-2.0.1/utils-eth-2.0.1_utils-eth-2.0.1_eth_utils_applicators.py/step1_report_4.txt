{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and individual values, often used for data processing or cleaning.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from sequences, dictionaries, and values provided as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Transforms data through user-provided formatter functions; potential risks if formatters are malicious or unsafe.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments into formatters and mapping functions, then yields transformed data; formatters are invoked on data at various points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of deprecation warnings indicates maintenance activity but not malicious intent. No obfuscated code or unusual language features present. The code relies on user-supplied formatter functions, which could be malicious if the formatter implementations are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a set of data transformation utilities, such as applying formatters at specific indices, combining multiple formatters, applying formatters conditionally, and remapping dictionary keys. It includes deprecation warnings for deprecated functions. The functions use standard Python idioms and rely on user-supplied callables for formatting. There are no network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms within this code snippet. The use of try-except blocks in 'apply_formatters_to_dict' for error handling appears legitimate. Since the core logic involves invoking external formatters, potential malicious behavior hinges on the content of these formatter functions, which are not included here. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns such as code injection or data leakage mechanisms within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for data formatting and transformation. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code by itself. Risks could arise if provided formatter functions are malicious, but the code structure itself is benign and consistent with normal data processing utilities.",
