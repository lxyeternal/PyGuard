{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying various types of data formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and other data structures, mainly for data processing and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'value', 'sequence', 'formatters', and 'value' dictionaries, as well as internal variables like 'key_mappings' and 'value.items()'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external systems or perform network operations. It transforms input data locally within the functions, with no evident data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Input data is received from parameters; formatters are applied conditionally or sequentially; transformed data is yielded or returned as generators or lists. No untrusted external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a deprecation warning indicating the function 'combine_argument_formatters' is deprecated, but this does not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of data transformation utilities using function composition, generators, and mapping. It uses standard Python constructs, type annotations, and warnings. No indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration, are present. Error handling focuses on input validation, raising appropriate exceptions for invalid input sizes or data formatting issues. The presence of a deprecation warning suggests ongoing maintenance but does not pose a security concern. The code appears legitimate and intended solely for data processing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate utility module for applying data formatters and transformations. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low. No suspicious or malicious anomalies are detected.",
