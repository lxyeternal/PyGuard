{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and data structures, primarily used for data processing and formatting.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters: lists, dictionaries, and callables (functions) for formatters and conditions.",
  "sinks": "Generated data outputs via yield statements; no direct sink involving external systems or sensitive data manipulation is present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through conditional checks and formatting functions, then yields transformed data; no external network or file operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation is benign. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution is present. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data formatting and transformation utilities, including applying formatters at specific indices, combining formatters, applying formatters to sequences or dicts, and mapping keys. The functions use standard Python features and warnings for deprecation. No external system calls, network activity, or file operations are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are observed. The code appears well-structured for intended utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, non-malicious utility module focused on data formatting and transformation. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is safe for use, with no immediate concerns detected.",
