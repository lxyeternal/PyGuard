  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for data transformation, no external data sources.\n- **Sinks:** No external system calls; only executes user-provided functions.\n- **Flows:** Data flows through functions; no network or file I/O.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, only deprecation warnings.\n- **Analysis:** Standard data transformation utilities; user-supplied functions could be malicious but this is expected.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; security risk is low (0.2). Malware score is 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data processing utilities.\n- No external I/O, no suspicious patterns.\n- The deprecation warning is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious intent; security risk very low (0.1). Malware score 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same general utility functions, no external system access.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard data formatting code; malware score 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focused on data formatting, no external communication.\n- No obfuscation or hidden behaviors.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; malware score 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar utility functions, no external I/O.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; malware score 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review and Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** All reports agree that the code is purely utility functions for data transformation, with no network, file, or system access.\n- **Execution of user-provided functions:** The only potential risk is the execution of user-supplied formatters or conditions, which could be malicious if those functions are untrusted. However, this is inherent to the utility's purpose and not indicative of malicious intent by the code itself.\n- **Obfuscation or hidden code:** None detected.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or backdoors:** Absent.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** None, apart from deprecation warnings, which are benign.\n\n### Recommendations on scores:\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports; justified given no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, around 0.1–0.2, reflecting the potential risk if formatter functions are malicious, but the code itself is benign.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for data transformation.\n- No evidence of supply chain sabotage, malware, or malicious behavior.\n- The only caveat is the reliance on user-supplied functions, which is typical for such utilities but warrants caution in untrusted environments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0               | No malicious code or behavior detected.                             |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.0               | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                     |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1–0.2           | Slight risk if formatter functions are malicious; inherent to utility. |\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for use in a supply chain context, with no malicious intent or sabotage evident.**",
