{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python utility library ('utils-eth') providing various helper functions for Ethereum-related data processing, encoding, decoding, and address management.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports (sys, warnings), external library (pkg_resources), internal module imports (.abi, .address, .applicators, etc.). No user input or external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present. The code mainly defines imports and a version retrieval.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules and functions, checking Python version, issuing warnings if necessary, and retrieving package version. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code structure is standard for a utility library, with no obfuscated or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, a Python version check, and a package version retrieval. No user input handling, network activity, or data processing occurs within this fragment. The warnings about Python 2 support are standard deprecation notices. All imported modules are typical for a utility library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. The code is straightforward and follows conventional patterns for such libraries.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware in this code. It functions as a standard utility library with version management and compatibility warnings. The structure and content do not suggest any security risks.",
