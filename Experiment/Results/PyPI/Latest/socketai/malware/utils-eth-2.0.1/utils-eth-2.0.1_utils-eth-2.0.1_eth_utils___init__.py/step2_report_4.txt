  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is solely composed of import statements, version retrieval, and a Python 2 deprecation warning.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Logic & Data Flow:** No data processing, no untrusted input handling, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Risk & Scores:** The report assigns malware = 0, risk = 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, primarily imports and a version check.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Logic & Data Flow:** No data flow or untrusted data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, aligns with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—imports, version check, deprecation warning.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs.\n- **Data flow:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, just imports and version check.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Data flow:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, straightforward imports and environment setup.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No issues.\n- **Data flow:** No data flow or untrusted input.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports correctly identify that this code is primarily import statements and environment checks, with no malicious or risky behaviors.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n- **Scores & Justification:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, which is justified. The risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate given the lack of any security concern.\n\n- **Potential higher risk scores?**  \n  Since no malicious activity, no untrusted data handling, and no code execution are present, increasing the risk or malware scores would be unjustified.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  The reports do not assume vulnerabilities beyond what is present. They correctly state that the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard utility module setup with no security risks or malicious behavior. The environment check and version retrieval are common practices, and no dynamic or untrusted data handling occurs here.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. No changes needed.",
