{
  "purpose": "This code initializes an Ethereum utility library by importing various modules and functions, retrieves the package version, and issues a deprecation warning for Python 2 support.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, version retrieval via pkg_resources, Python version check",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static imports and version check only",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a standard deprecation warning for Python 2 support; no suspicious or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, version retrieval, and a deprecation warning. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The structure is typical for a utility library setup, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The deprecation warning is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. All imported modules are internal and standard for Ethereum-related development. No anomalies or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup for an Ethereum utility library, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
