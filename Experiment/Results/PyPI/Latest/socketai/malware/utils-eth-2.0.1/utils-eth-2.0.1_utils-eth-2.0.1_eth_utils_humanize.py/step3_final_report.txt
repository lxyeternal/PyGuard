  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable formatting of durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as seconds, bytes, Hash32, URI strings, and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions; functions perform local data processing and validation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into formatting or validation functions, producing formatted strings or validation results; no external data flow or system effect.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with simple validation and formatting logic. IPFS CID validation is limited to CIDv0 but deliberate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of benign utility functions for data formatting and validation. No network, file, or system modifications are present. Validation functions are standard and safe. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scoring in reports (malware=0, low security risk) aligns with the benign nature. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, well-structured utility functions with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 or 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
