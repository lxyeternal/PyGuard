{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for humanizing and formatting data such as seconds, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (e.g., bytes, hashes, URIs, integers) and external modules (e.g., parse.urlparse).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings for display purposes; no external sinks or untrusted data effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting functions, with no transformation leading to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform data formatting and humanization: converting seconds to human-readable units, bytes to hex snippets, IPFS URIs to abbreviated forms, and sequences of integers to compact ranges. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The functions operate purely on input data and produce formatted output. No external network connections, system modifications, or sensitive data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be purely utility functions for formatting and humanizing data, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is standard and does not include any suspicious or potentially harmful code.",
