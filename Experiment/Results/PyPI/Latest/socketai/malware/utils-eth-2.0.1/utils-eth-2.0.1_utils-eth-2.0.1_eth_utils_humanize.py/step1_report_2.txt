  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable formatting of time, bytes, hashes, URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input directly; they process passed arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to security vulnerabilities or data leaks; functions primarily perform formatting and validation.",
  "flows": "Not applicable as there are no external data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. All functions perform benign formatting, validation, or parsing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for formatting durations, byte sequences, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences. It includes validation for IPFS URI scheme and CIDv0 hashes but does not handle or process untrusted external data beyond validation. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are present. The functions operate in a stateless manner and do not invoke external commands or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions focused on data formatting and validation without any malicious intent or security risks. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
