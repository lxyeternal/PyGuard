{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for humanizing time durations, byte sequences, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences for better readability.",
  "sources": "User-provided data inputs such as URI strings, bytes, and integer sequences; data read via function parameters and external libraries like 'parse' and 'eth_typing'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted human-readable strings; no data is sent to external systems or network; no unsafe data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (URI strings, bytes, integers) are processed through parsing, slicing, and formatting functions, with no untrusted data flow leading to external effects or vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior are evident. Code relies on standard library functions, and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of utility functions for formatting durations, byte sequences, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences. Functions perform parsing, string slicing, and formatting with no network or system modifications. No untrusted data is used in insecure or dangerous operations; functions are purely computational and formatting in nature. The IPFS URI validation is straightforward, and the humanization functions are simple string manipulations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility functions for data formatting and human-readable conversion. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities within the provided code. It is safe and does not perform any harmful operations.",
