  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package 'utils-eth' that provides utility functions related to Ethereum.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setuptools modules for package setup; defining dependencies and extras.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The code primarily handles package setup and dependency declarations.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> assigns to long_description; processes package data and dependencies -> passes data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Usage of standard setup procedures and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing necessary modules from setuptools, defining extras_require for different development purposes, reading a README file for the long description, and calling setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input handling, no network calls, and no suspicious code patterns are present. Dependencies are properly versioned, and no anomalies in code structure are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional Python package setup file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It handles package configuration securely without any indications of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
