  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package related to Ethereum utilities.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package metadata and dependencies; imports setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly handles untrusted input or outputs data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads file content (README.md) and uses static package data for setup configuration; no runtime data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines dependencies for various development environments, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All code is static configuration; no runtime or untrusted data handling. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Usage of environment variables or dynamic code execution is absent. The package appears legitimate, aligned with standard Python package distribution practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly handles static metadata and dependencies without any suspicious logic.",
