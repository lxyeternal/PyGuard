{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup configuration script for packaging the 'utils-eth' Python library related to Ethereum utilities.",
  "sources": "Reads static files such as README.md; defines dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or output; static configuration data.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration parameters used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a static README file, defines dependencies with version constraints, and calls setup() with package metadata. It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code. Dependencies are standard and versioned appropriately. The code adheres to common packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup.py script for packaging a Python Ethereum utility library. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
