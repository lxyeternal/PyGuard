{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package called 'utils-eth', intended to configure package metadata, dependencies, and installation options for distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, static metadata definitions, and dependency lists within setup() and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not write data to external sources, nor does it process untrusted input during runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; dependency lists are hardcoded, and file reading is from a static file.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code uses standard Python packaging practices with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for packaging. It imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, defines optional dependencies, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and package configurations. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network interactions are present. All dependencies are specified with version constraints, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code strictly adheres to standard practices for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate distribution configuration for an Ethereum utility library.",
