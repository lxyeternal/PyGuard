  "purpose": "Ethereum address validation, normalization, and checksum handling.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern matching, type validation functions, cryptographic keccak hashing, string and byte conversions.",
  "sinks": "None; internal data processing only, no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (address strings or bytes) -> validation functions -> cryptographic hashing -> checksum formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum address validation and checksum creation using regex, type checks, and keccak hashing. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. Cryptographic functions are used appropriately for checksum addresses, consistent with Ethereum standards. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Ethereum address utility library with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
