{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling, validating, and normalizing Ethereum addresses in various formats.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from function arguments, primarily addresses in string, bytes, or other address representations.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or environment variable access. The code only processes data locally.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and transformed through various functions, including normalization, checksum conversion, and format validation, without propagating data to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. All functions perform straightforward validation and transformation without any obfuscated or hidden behavior. The import statements are standard for Ethereum address handling.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically validates and converts Ethereum addresses in multiple formats, ensuring correctness and format compliance. It uses regular expressions and cryptographic hash functions for checksum validation, but these are standard cryptographic operations, not malicious. No data leakage, network activity, or malicious side effects are present. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility library for Ethereum address processing, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs necessary validation and conversion functions securely and transparently.",
