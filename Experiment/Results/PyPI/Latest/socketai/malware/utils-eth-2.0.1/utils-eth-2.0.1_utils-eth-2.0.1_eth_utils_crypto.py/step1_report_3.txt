{
  "purpose": "Compute the keccak (SHA-3) hash of input data, supporting multiple input formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive (bytes, int, bool), hexstr, text",
  "sinks": "Returns hashed bytes; no external data sinks or network calls",
  "flows": "Input parameters are converted to bytes via to_bytes, then hashed with keccak_256",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to compute keccak hashes, accepting various input types and converting them via an external to_bytes function. It relies on a well-known cryptographic library (eth_hash). The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious data flows. No external or untrusted sources are read within this snippet. The presence of a conversion function might warrant review, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility function for hashing data with keccak. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious data flows, or security risks within this snippet.",
