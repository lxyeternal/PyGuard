  "purpose": "Wrapper function to compute Keccak-256 hash of various input types after converting them to bytes.",
  "sources": "Inputs: primitive (bytes, int, bool), hexstr, text; converted via to_bytes()",
  "sinks": "Hashing function keccak_256() processes the bytes; no external data leaks or network calls",
  "flows": "Input -> to_bytes() -> keccak_256() -> output bytes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward cryptographic utility wrapping a standard hashing library. It accepts multiple input formats, converts them reliably via to_bytes(), and hashes the result with a well-known cryptographic function. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is present. The reliance on external libraries and utility functions appears standard and safe. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or backdoors. All reports concur on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risks. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and standard practices involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It relies on trusted external libraries and utility functions. The overall security risk is minimal, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
