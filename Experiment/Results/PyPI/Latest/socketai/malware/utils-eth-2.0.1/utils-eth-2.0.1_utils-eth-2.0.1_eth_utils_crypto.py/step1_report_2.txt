  "purpose": "The function computes the Keccak hash of various input types, likely for cryptographic or blockchain-related operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive (bytes, int, bool), hexstr, text",
  "sinks": "The keccak_256 function, which outputs the hash; potential use of to_bytes conversion",
  "flows": "Input parameters → to_bytes conversion → keccak_256 hashing function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code relies on external cryptographic library for hashing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that accepts multiple input types, converts them to bytes, and computes a Keccak hash. The reliance on external, well-known cryptographic library (eth_hash.auto.keccak) reduces the likelihood of malicious implementation. The to_bytes conversion function appears to be a utility for input normalization, which is standard practice. No suspicious code paths, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. The function's purpose aligns with cryptographic hashing, common in blockchain applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for hashing data with Keccak, with no signs of malicious behavior. It uses external libraries appropriately and performs typical input normalization before hashing. No security concerns identified in this snippet.",
