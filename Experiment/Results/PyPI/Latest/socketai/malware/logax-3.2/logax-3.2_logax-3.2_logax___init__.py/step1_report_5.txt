  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'info'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present in the snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import, which can obscure the source of variables or functions, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a module import, which is standard in Python. No additional code, data input, or execution is shown. The import could potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module itself contains malicious payload, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The import statement itself is not suspicious; it is common practice but can be risky if the 'info' module is untrusted. No indicators of malware, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent. The security risk depends on the content of the 'info' module, which is not provided. As it stands, the snippet is benign.",
