  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate these reports and the code snippet:\n\nCode snippet:\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n**Assessment of the code:**\n- It performs a relative import of all contents from the `info` module within the same package.\n- Use of wildcard import (`*`) is generally discouraged because it obscures what symbols are imported, potentially leading to namespace pollution.\n- The import itself is a common pattern in Python packages, with no direct malicious behavior evident.\n- No data processing, input/output, or execution beyond the import is present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is syntactically correct and does what it intends: imports all symbols from `info`.\n- No malicious activity or malware is directly observable from this line alone.\n- The concern about wildcard import hiding potentially malicious code in `info` is valid but cannot be confirmed without inspecting the `info` module itself.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the import pattern and its typical usage.\n- They note the risks of wildcard imports but do not claim malicious intent.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- The confidence levels vary but are generally reasonable.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports, which is correct as the code is straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher where confidence is lower (around 0.2), which is acceptable given the potential for malicious code in the `info` module if compromised.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The main concern is the content of the `info` module, which cannot be assessed here.\n- Wildcard imports are discouraged; replacing `from .info import *` with explicit imports would improve code clarity and security.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the import statement itself)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (low, primarily due to wildcard import risks)\n\n**Overall, the import statement is benign but warrants inspection of the `info` module for malicious content.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The wildcard import is a stylistic and security concern but not malicious.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the evidence.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import potential, but no malicious activity detected)\n\nProceed with caution to review the `info` module for any malicious or obfuscated code.",
