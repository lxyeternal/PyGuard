{
  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module 'info' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink; the import may load additional code or data from 'info'.",
  "flows": "The imported module's contents may be executed or used elsewhere, but no explicit flow in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') can be risky as it obscures what is imported; no explicit malicious behavior detected from this line alone.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports everything from a local module named 'info'. This pattern is common in Python packages. The lack of further code prevents assessment of malicious activity, but the import itself is standard. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present here. The focus is on whether 'info' contains malicious code, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement without evident malicious behavior. However, reliance on wildcard imports can mask imported content, which might include malicious code if 'info' is compromised. Additional context or inspection of the 'info' module is necessary for a definitive security assessment.",
