  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n**1. Confirming if issues are present:**\n- All reports agree that this is a straightforward import statement.\n- No additional code, data, or behavior is provided that would suggest malicious activity.\n- The import uses a relative path, which is common in package modules.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports correctly identify the use of wildcard import ('*') as a potential concern for namespace pollution but do not consider it inherently malicious.\n- They note that without inspecting the 'info' module, we cannot determine if malicious code exists within it.\n- No logical errors are apparent in the assessments.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to each issue:**\n- Most reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting cautious acknowledgment of the wildcard import pattern.\n- Confidence levels vary but are generally reasonable given the limited context.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the minimal code and lack of evidence.\n- The main concern is the potential for the 'info' module to contain malicious code, but this cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- Since the code only performs an import, and there's no indication of malicious payload, malware scores of 0 are justified.\n- If the 'info' module were compromised, that would change the risk profile, but such information isn't available here.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that the 'info' module might be malicious if compromised, which is valid but speculative.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or backdoors are made beyond the wildcard import concern.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code snippet is benign on its own.**  \nThe main concern is the use of a wildcard import, which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised. However, based solely on this line, there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### My recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, primarily due to wildcard import concern, but not inherently dangerous)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The security risk could be slightly higher if the 'info' module is untrusted or compromised, but without further context, the risk remains low.\n- The focus should be on inspecting the 'info' module itself for malicious content.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard import statement with minimal security concern. The wildcard import is a stylistic issue but not a malicious one. No changes needed to the report scores based on the provided information.",
