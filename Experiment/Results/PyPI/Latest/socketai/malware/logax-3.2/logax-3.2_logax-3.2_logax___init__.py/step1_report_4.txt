{
  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions and objects from a module named 'info' within the same package, likely to access data or functions defined there.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module ('info'). No external input or data reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this single line of code; it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can lead to namespace pollution and is generally discouraged, but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing all symbols from a local module. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations. The use of a wildcard import is a stylistic concern but not inherently malicious. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, secret backdoors, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is the use of a wildcard import, which could obscure the source of imported symbols but does not pose a security threat.",
