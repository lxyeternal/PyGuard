  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the reported issues with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed facts:\n- The code performs a relative import from a module named `info` within the same package.\n- It uses a wildcard import (`*`), which is generally discouraged because it obscures what symbols are imported.\n- There is no additional code, data flow, or execution beyond this import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies the import from local `info`.\n- **Analysis & anomalies:** No malicious behavior detected; use of wildcard import noted as a risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.5, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The score seems reasonable. The low malware and security risk align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard import.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** confidence 1, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The confidence is high, which makes sense given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & anomalies:** Wildcard import can hide malicious code if the module is compromised, but no evidence here.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard pattern.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.7, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence is justified due to the inherent risk of wildcard imports, but no actual malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & anomalies:** Same as above; use of wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just stylistic concern.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.7, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; no signs of malware.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & anomalies:** Same reasoning; no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, with the main concern being the wildcard import.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.5, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent. The import statement itself does not imply malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting the minimal code and the risks associated with wildcard imports.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports do not consider the content of the `info` module. If `info` were malicious, the import could be dangerous, but from this snippet alone, no such evidence exists.\n- The main concern with this code is the use of `import *`, which can obscure what is imported, but this is a stylistic issue rather than a security flaw.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- Given the simplicity of the code, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (reflecting the wildcard import concern but no actual malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores in the reports are appropriate.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which can be risky if the imported module is compromised, but no evidence of malicious activity is present here.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import concerns)\n\nThis careful review confirms that the code snippet is benign in its current form.",
