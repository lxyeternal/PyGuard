{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local 'info' module within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data or input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the import simply loads symbols into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if 'info' is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import from the 'info' module. Wildcard imports are discouraged due to namespace pollution and obscurity but are not inherently malicious. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present in this line. The risk depends on the trustworthiness of the 'info' module; if compromised, it could introduce malicious code. The import itself is standard and benign, but the wildcard pattern warrants caution. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and low security risk scores reflecting the import pattern's potential for obscurity.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no direct malicious activity. The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised. Without inspecting 'info', the risk remains low but non-zero. Overall, the code is safe in isolation, and the reports' scores are appropriate.",
