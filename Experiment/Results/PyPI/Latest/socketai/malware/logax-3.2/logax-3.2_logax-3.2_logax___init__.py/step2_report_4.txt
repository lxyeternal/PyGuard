  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, correctness of reasoning, and consistency of scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet is: `from .info import *`\n- This is a relative wildcard import, common in Python packages.\n- No additional code, data flows, or external inputs are shown.\n- The main concern with such imports is obscurity and potential inclusion of malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised.\n- All reports agree that this line alone is benign, with some noting the risks of wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present in the code:\n\n**Issue presence:**  \n- The code itself is straightforward; it does not contain malicious code or anomalies.  \n- The import statement is standard, though wildcard imports are discouraged for clarity and safety.  \n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are evident in this snippet.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n### Identifying errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n\n- **Logical correctness:**  \n  - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement.\n  - They recognize the potential risks of wildcard imports but do not assume malicious intent solely based on this line.\n  - They appropriately note that the actual maliciousness depends on the contents of the 'info' module, which is not provided.\n\n- **Potential flaws:**  \n  - The reports could emphasize more strongly that without inspecting 'info', we cannot definitively assess maliciousness.\n  - The confidence levels vary; some are at 0.5, others at 1. The reasoning for these confidence levels seems consistent with the content.\n\n**Overall:**  \n- No significant logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the scores assigned:\n\n| Report | Obfuscated | Malware | SecurityRisk |\n|---------|--------------|---------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0            | 0       | 0.1          |\n| 2       | 0            | 0       | 0            |\n| 3       | 0            | 0       | 0.2          |\n| 4       | 0            | 0       | 0.2          |\n| 5       | 0            | 0       | 0.2          |\n\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware:** Correctly 0; no malicious code evident.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.2, reflecting the risk of wildcard import obscurity but not maliciousness.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- Given the absence of any malicious activity, all scores seem reasonable.  \n- The risk scores could be slightly adjusted to zero if we consider the content benign, but the current scores appropriately reflect the potential risk of obscurity.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.2, which is appropriate given the lack of evidence for malicious activity.\n- The only concern is the wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if 'info' is compromised, but this is a general risk, not an active threat here.\n\n### Malware scores:\n\n- All are zero, which is correct based on the provided snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the import statement.\n- They acknowledge that the actual threat depends on the content of 'info', which is not available.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels match the certainty expressed in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — considering the wildcard import can obscure imported content, but this is a minimal concern without further context.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is benign; the reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a stylistic and safety concern but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \n- The reports are well-reasoned and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed unless additional context reveals malicious content in 'info'.\n\n**Final note:**  \nFor a thorough security assessment, inspecting the 'info' module would be necessary, but based solely on this import statement, the code is safe.",
