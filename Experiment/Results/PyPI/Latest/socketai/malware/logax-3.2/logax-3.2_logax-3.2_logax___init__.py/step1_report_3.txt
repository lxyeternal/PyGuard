  "purpose": "Imports all contents from the 'info' module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module ('info')",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected in this single line",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can hide malicious or unsafe imports, but not inherently malicious itself",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement using a relative import syntax. No additional code, data input, or execution flow is present to analyze further. The wildcard import could potentially bring in malicious or unintended code if the 'info' module is compromised, but based solely on this line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. It is a common pattern in package code and does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard import statement with no evident malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of wildcard import which can obscure imported content but is not malicious per se. No malware or security risks are detected from this single line.",
