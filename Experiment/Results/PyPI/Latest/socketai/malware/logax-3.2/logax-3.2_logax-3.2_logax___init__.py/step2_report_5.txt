  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same line of code, with minor variations.\n- The code is a relative wildcard import from a local module named `info`.\n- There is no additional code, data flow, or execution context provided.\n- Wildcard imports (`*`) are generally discouraged because they obscure what is imported and can lead to namespace pollution, but they are not inherently malicious.\n- The security risk associated with this line alone is minimal unless the `info` module itself is malicious or compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that this is a simple import statement. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident in this line alone.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports correctly note that the import itself is benign but highlight the potential risks of wildcard imports.  \n- No report claims that the code performs malicious actions, which is accurate.  \n- They also acknowledge that the actual content of `info` is unknown, which is critical.\n\n---\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Confidence:**  \n  Most reports assign a confidence of 0.5 to 1, which seems reasonable given the limited context.  \n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.  \n- **Malware:**  \n  All assign 0, which is appropriate unless the `info` module is malicious.  \n- **Security Risk:**  \n  Slightly higher in some reports (0.2), reflecting the concern that if `info` is compromised, malicious code could be imported.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The security risk score could be slightly increased if there is suspicion that `info` might be compromised, but based solely on this line, 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation:\n- No malware is detected here; the code is a standard import statement.  \n- No obfuscation is present.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:\n- Any claims suggesting malicious intent are speculative without evidence.  \n- The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about the content of `info`.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- The main point of contention is the security risk score, which should reflect the potential danger if `info` is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code snippet itself is benign.  \n- The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if `info` is compromised.  \n- Without further context, the risk remains low but non-zero.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the snippet itself)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.3 (moderate, depending on trust in the `info` module)\n\n**Justification:**  \n- The import pattern is common but risky if the module is compromised.  \n- Since no malicious activity is evident, the malware score remains at 0.  \n- The risk score should be kept low unless additional context indicates a threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard import statement with no inherent malicious behavior.  \n- The main concern is the trustworthiness of the `info` module, which cannot be assessed here.  \n- Scores should reflect that the code itself is benign, with a slight security concern due to potential module compromise.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (consistent with the reports, perhaps slightly lower if more context suggests trust in the module)",
