{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'info' within the same package, likely to use its functions, variables, or classes.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the 'info' module within the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this line; it does not involve untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from this single import statement alone, as it does not execute code or process data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import of all elements from a local module named 'info'. There are no indications of malicious intent or unusual behavior in this line. Since the import is from a relative module, it is typical in package development. No external data is read, and no harmful actions are performed here.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a common pattern in Python packages for modular code organization.",
