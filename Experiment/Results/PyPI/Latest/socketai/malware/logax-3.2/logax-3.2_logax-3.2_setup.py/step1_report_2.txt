  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the Python library 'logax'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, accessing package metadata, specifying dependencies.",
  "targets": "No specific untrusted data sinks; primarily configuration code.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Setup configuration; no data flow to external systems or inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions to define package setup parameters. It reads a Markdown file for long description, which is standard. No user input handling, network activity, or executable code is present. Dependencies are specified as 'requests' and 'pybase64', which are common libraries. No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The setup configuration appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
