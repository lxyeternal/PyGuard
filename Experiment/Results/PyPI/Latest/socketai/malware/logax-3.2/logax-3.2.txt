      "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no direct malicious activity. The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised. Without inspecting 'info', the risk remains low but non-zero. Overall, the code is safe in isolation, and the reports' scores are appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior characteristic of malware, including remote code download and execution, obfuscation, and persistence mechanisms. The high likelihood of malicious intent is supported by the code's design and behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.85-0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation ~0.75-0.8) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
