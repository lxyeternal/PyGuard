  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'akobo' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run() call executing a curl command to an external URL.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() command that executes an external command which could potentially be malicious if the command is manipulated or if the URL is malicious.",
  "flows": "The script runs subprocess.run() with a curl command that makes an HTTP request to an external URL, potentially transmitting data or triggering external actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run() to execute 'curl' directly, which is unusual in a setup script and can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands. The URL is hardcoded and points to an external webhook, which could be used for data exfiltration or malicious control.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard imports of setuptools and subprocess. However, immediately invokes subprocess.run() with a curl command targeting an external URL. This command could send data or trigger unwanted actions upon package installation. The rest of the code defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical setup.py manner, which appears legitimate. The presence of the subprocess call with an external URL is suspicious because it executes a command outside the normal setup process, possibly for malicious purposes such as tracking, exfiltration, or remote control. No other malicious or suspicious code is present in the rest of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious subprocess call executing a curl command to an external URL during package setup, which could be used for data exfiltration or malicious control. The rest of the code is standard setup logic, but the subprocess call is a significant concern and indicates malicious intent or sabotage.",
