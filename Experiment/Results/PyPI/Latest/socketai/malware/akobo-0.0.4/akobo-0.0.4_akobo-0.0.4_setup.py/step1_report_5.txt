  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'akobo' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Subprocess command executing 'curl' to a URL; reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "External URL request via subprocess; reading local file 'README.md'.",
  "flows": "subprocess.run() fetches data from the internet; reading 'README.md' into package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to execute 'curl' command to an external URL during setup, which is unusual and suspicious. No validation or handling of this external request. The 'curl' command could be used for data exfiltration or signaling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup for a Python package with dependencies and metadata. However, it includes a subprocess call executing 'curl' to a specified URL, which is atypical for package setup scripts. This command could be used maliciously to notify an attacker or exfiltrate information when the package is installed or built. There are no other suspicious or malicious behaviors such as backdoors, credential theft, or system manipulation. The rest of the code appears standard for a setup script, loading dependencies and reading a README file. The external curl call represents a potential security concern, as it could be used for malicious tracking or communication. The rest of the code is benign and typical for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the subprocess call executing 'curl' to an external URL, which could be used maliciously for tracking, signaling, or data exfiltration. The code otherwise appears to be a normal setup script. The malicious activity score is moderate due to the external network request, but there's no direct evidence of malicious intent beyond this behavior.",
