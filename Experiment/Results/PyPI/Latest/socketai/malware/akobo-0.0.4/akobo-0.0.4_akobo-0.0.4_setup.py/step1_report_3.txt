{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'akobo' with specified dependencies and metadata, and perform an external webhook call.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run command executing a curl request to an external URL.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run command which makes an external network request potentially leaking data or confirming activity.",
  "flows": "The script executes subprocess.run with a curl command to an external URL, which could send system or environment data if the URL or request is manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "The use of subprocess.run to execute a curl command within a setup script is unusual and suspicious, especially without handling or sanitizing data. No other suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup using setuptools with specified dependencies and metadata. The only non-standard behavior is the subprocess.run call that executes a curl command to an external webhook URL. This call is made unconditionally at script import time, which is suspicious because it could be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or delivering malicious payloads without user consent. No other malicious behavior or obfuscation is observed. External call is a potential privacy violation or security risk depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign in terms of typical setup scripts, but the inclusion of an unconditional external webhook request is highly suspicious and could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. This behavior should be considered malicious or at least suspicious, as it executes outside normal setup procedures without user awareness.",
