{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'akobo' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run command executing 'curl' to a specified URL at the beginning of the script.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess command could be used to send data or trigger network activity without user awareness.",
  "flows": "The code executes 'curl' via subprocess before any package setup logic, potentially transmitting data to an external URL immediately upon execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.run to invoke 'curl' with a URL at script start is unusual for a setup script and suggests possible malicious intent. The URL is hardcoded, and no verification or logging of the response is present.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setuptools and subprocess. It then executes a subprocess to run 'curl' on a suspicious URL, which could indicate data exfiltration or remote command/control if malicious. The rest of the script is a standard package setup, defining metadata and dependencies without further suspicious activity. The early 'curl' command is anomalous in this context and potentially malicious, as it runs unconditionally at script start, possibly leaking information or triggering external servers without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious command that makes an outbound network request to a third-party URL at the very start, which is atypical for a standard setup script. This behavior suggests possible malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or remote control activation, with a malware score of approximately 0.6. The overall security risk is high, with a potential threat to system privacy and security. Confidence in this conclusion is high due to the unusual and potentially malicious subprocess call.",
