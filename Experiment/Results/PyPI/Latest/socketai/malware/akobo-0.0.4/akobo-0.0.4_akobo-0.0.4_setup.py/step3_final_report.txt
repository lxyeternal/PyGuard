{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run call executing 'curl' to an external URL during script import.",
  "sinks": "The external URL request could lead to data exfiltration, remote command execution, or tracking.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from import to subprocess.run, which makes an external network request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of an external network request ('curl') at the start of the setup script, which is atypical and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a subprocess call executing 'curl' to an external URL immediately upon import, which is not standard for setup scripts. This behavior can facilitate malicious activities such as data exfiltration or remote control. The rest of the code is standard package configuration. The external request is unconditioned and executed without validation, increasing suspicion. No obfuscation or other malicious code is present. Given the context, this behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The subprocess call to an external webhook during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious or suspicious activity, such as data exfiltration or remote command-and-control. The scores should reflect high malware and security risk levels, approximately 0.8, with no obfuscation detected.",
