  "purpose": "The code imports a class GSheetsConnection from a module within the streamlit_gsheets package, likely for establishing a connection to Google Sheets.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing GSheetsConnection class from streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or source-to-sink paths are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code is standard for a package import.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single import statement. The comments indicate licensing and copyright information, which is typical and benign. The import statement is a standard import from a third-party library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or data handling.\n\nThere are no inputs, data processing, or network communications present in this fragment. Since it is only an import, it does not perform any actions or data leaks.\n\nNo hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are identified. The code appears to be part of a larger project and does not itself pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with associated licensing comments. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated elements. It is a standard import in a Python project, with no indication of harmful intent.",
