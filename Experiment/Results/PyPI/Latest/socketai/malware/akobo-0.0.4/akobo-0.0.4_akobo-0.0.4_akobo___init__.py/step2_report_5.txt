  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code snippet, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement following a license header.\n- No untrusted data, input handling, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is minimal and appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Importing `GSheetsConnection` for Google Sheets connection.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence is reasonable, given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, straightforward import.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Also correctly identifies benign intent.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; high confidence and no issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correctly notes the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0, obfuscated 0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** Confirmed; it's just an import statement with licensing comments.\n- **Malware risk:** None detected; all reports agree on zero.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risk:** None.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- Since the code is a simple import statement, there's no reason to increase any scores.\n- The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code snippet is benign, and no further action is necessary.",
