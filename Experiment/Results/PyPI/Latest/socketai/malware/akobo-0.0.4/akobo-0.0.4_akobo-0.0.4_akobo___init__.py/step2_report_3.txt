  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement preceded by license comments.\n   - The original code snippet only contains license headers and a single import statement: `from streamlit_gsheets.gsheets_connection import GSheetsConnection`.\n   - There are no signs of code execution, data handling, or network activity.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reported issues are not present in the code. The code is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is just an import statement with license headers.\n   - They do not overstate or understate the security implications.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are well-reasoned and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), reflecting certainty in their benign assessment.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is only an import statement with license comments, there is no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n   - No malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are indicated.\n   - The import could be part of a larger malicious package, but based solely on this snippet, no such evidence exists.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification exists for increasing the risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately state that the code is benign.\n   - They do not infer malicious intent where none exists.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect this. No security concerns are present.**",
