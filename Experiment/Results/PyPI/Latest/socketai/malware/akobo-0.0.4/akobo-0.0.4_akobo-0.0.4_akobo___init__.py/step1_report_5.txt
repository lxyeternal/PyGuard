  "sinks": "No data sink or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed; only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license header and a single import statement. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or contain any code that could be malicious. The import is from a third-party library, which is typical and not suspicious by itself. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard license header followed by an import statement with no malicious or security concern. It appears to be a minimal, benign module setup.",
