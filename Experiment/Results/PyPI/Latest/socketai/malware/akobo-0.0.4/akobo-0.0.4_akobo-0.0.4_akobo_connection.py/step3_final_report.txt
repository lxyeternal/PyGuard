{
  "purpose": "Provides an API wrapper for Google Sheets, supporting reading, querying, creating, updating, and clearing spreadsheets via gspread, with credential management and URL validation.",
  "sources": "Secrets dictionary for credentials, URL parsing for public sheets, user inputs for spreadsheet and worksheet identifiers.",
  "sinks": "gspread API calls, pandas dataframes, duckdb SQL execution, network requests for CSV downloads.",
  "flows": "Input data (secrets, URLs, parameters) into gspread and pandas functions, with validation and exception handling; data flows into network and database sinks without code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected; URL validation and regex usage are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and practices for interacting with Google Sheets, including credential handling, URL validation, and data operations. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The functions raise appropriate exceptions for unsupported operations, and data flows are controlled and validated. The use of cache_data for caching responses is standard. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured API wrapper for Google Sheets, with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The low security risk score reflects typical external API interactions. The reports are consistent and accurate.",
