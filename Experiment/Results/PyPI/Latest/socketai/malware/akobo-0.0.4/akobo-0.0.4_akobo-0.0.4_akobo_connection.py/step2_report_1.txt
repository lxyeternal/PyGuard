  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logic, data flows, and potential security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as an API for Google Sheets, handling credentials via secrets_dict, with URL parsing for public sheets.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into gspread, pandas, duckdb, with no suspicious network activity or code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. Use of regex and URL parsing appears standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment that the code is legitimate and low risk is accurate.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code or behavior)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to network interaction with external APIs, but standard)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on data sources and credential handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses read_csv, duckdb, pandas, with no suspicious data exfiltration or code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets; URL validation is standard; no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard API wrapper with no malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, typical data handling and network access)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar overview; credentials from secrets_dict, URL validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard data operations, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets; URL validation is standard; no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe implementation.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on credential management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard pandas, gspread, duckdb usage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets are passed securely, caching is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, standard data operations)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general pattern, credentials via secrets_dict, URL validation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard data fetch and write operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure code.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, backdoors, or code injection. The code strictly performs data operations with well-known libraries.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero due to network interactions and data handling, but overall very low.\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1 - 0.2 |\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for Google Sheets, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities beyond typical data handling. The low risk score reflects the potential for network interaction but does not indicate any malicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and I agree with their assessments. The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and a very low security risk.",
