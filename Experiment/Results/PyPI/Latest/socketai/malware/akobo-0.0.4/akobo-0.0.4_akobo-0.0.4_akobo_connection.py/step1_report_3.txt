{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for interacting with Google Sheets via service account and public access, enabling reading, querying, creating, updating, and clearing spreadsheets and worksheets within a Streamlit application.",
  "sources": "Reads input from parameters such as 'secrets_dict' (for credentials), URL validation and parsing functions, and function parameters like 'spreadsheet', 'worksheet', 'sql', and 'data'.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions that fetch data from URLs (e.g., 'read_csv'), manipulate spreadsheets (e.g., 'add_worksheet', 'set_with_dataframe'), and execute SQL queries via 'duckdb'.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs such as URLs or user-provided parameters through validation and parsing functions into data processing and storage functions like 'read_csv', 'set_with_dataframe', and 'duckdb.sql'. The code also reads credentials from secrets and configuration for connecting to Google Sheets, then performs read/write operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; credentials are loaded from passed dictionaries. No suspicious URL manipulations or unusual data flows are evident. The code strictly performs expected spreadsheet operations. The only exception is the explicit raising of 'UnsupportedOperationException' for certain public client operations, which is standard behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract and concrete classes for interacting with Google Sheets via service accounts and public URLs. It carefully manages credentials, validates URLs, and uses caching decorators for data fetching. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden code are detected. The operations performed are standard for spreadsheet management, with safe URL handling and data conversion routines. The functions do not contain hardcoded secrets or unsafe code injections, nor do they perform any unauthorized data exfiltration. Overall, the code appears legitimate and adheres to standard API usage patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured implementation of Google Sheets interaction within a Streamlit app, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It manages credentials securely, uses safe URL validation, and performs standard spreadsheet operations. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or security risks beyond typical application behavior.",
