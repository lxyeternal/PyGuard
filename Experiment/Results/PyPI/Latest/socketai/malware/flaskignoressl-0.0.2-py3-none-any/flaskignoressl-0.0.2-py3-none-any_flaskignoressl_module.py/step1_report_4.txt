{
  "purpose": "Load and send SSL configuration data from a local file to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads the filename for the SSL key from a base64-encoded string and from a file path derived from it.",
  "sinks": "The code makes an HTTP POST request to a URL decoded from a base64 string, sending the content of a local file as data.",
  "flows": "Decodes the URL from base64, reads a filename from a decoded path, then sends the file content to the decoded URL via POST request.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64-encoded strings for URL and filename, which can obscure malicious intent; no input validation or sanitization; hardcoded URLs and filenames; no verification of the server or certificate; potential for misuse if the decoded URL is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes a base64-encoded URL and filename. It then checks if a file at the decoded filename exists, reads its content, and posts it to the decoded URL. The URL points to an external server, and the file content is sent without validation or encryption. The use of base64 encoding can hide malicious intent, and the external communication could leak sensitive configuration data. No explicit validation or security checks are present, raising concerns about potential data exfiltration or malicious command and control activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed to read a local file specified by a filename decoded from base64, then send its content to a remote URL also decoded from base64. This behavior can be suspicious, especially if the filename and URL are controlled by an attacker, as it could facilitate data exfiltration. There are no immediate indicators of malicious payloads like malware, but the obfuscation and external data transmission are concerning.",
