  "purpose": "Load an SSL configuration file, decode URLs, and send configuration data via HTTP POST request to a decoded URL endpoint.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, local files (via os.path.exists and open).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP POST request to a URL decoded from base64 data, with data read from a local file.",
  "flows": "Decodes base64 URL to get the endpoint URL, reads a filename from the local filesystem, then posts the file content to the decoded URL.",
  "anomalies": "Base64-encoded URL and filename, dynamic decoding of URLs and file paths, no explicit hardcoded credentials. The decoded URL points to an external domain, which could be used maliciously if the URL or file content is manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes a base64 URL to form an external endpoint, then checks for the existence of a file whose name is obtained from the decoded data. If the file exists, it reads the content and POSTs it to the external URL. The URL and filename are obfuscated via base64, which can hide malicious intent. There are no obvious hardcoded secrets other than encoded strings, but the dynamic nature and external network communication suggest potential for malicious use, especially if the decoded URL is malicious or the local file contains sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs obfuscated decoding of a URL and filename, then reads a local file and sends its content to an external endpoint. This behavior could be malicious if the external URL is malicious or if the file content is sensitive. The obfuscation and external communication raise security concerns, though there is no direct evidence of malicious intent in the code itself.",
