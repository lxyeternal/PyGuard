  "purpose": "The code decodes base64-encoded strings to obtain file paths and URLs, reads a local SSL key file, and sends its contents to a remote server via an HTTP POST request, potentially for SSL configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a file path obtained by decoding base64-encoded string 'base_ssl_key'.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to a URL decoded from 'base_ssl_cert' via an HTTP POST request.",
  "flows": "Decoded SSL key file path -> reads file content -> sends content to decoded URL via POST request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded strings for URLs and file paths, which could obscure malicious intent; sending potentially sensitive data over HTTP; lack of input validation; possible sensitive data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64-encoded URL and file path, then reads the file at that path. It posts the contents of this file to the decoded URL. The URL and file path are obfuscated with base64, which may hide malicious intent. The URL is an HTTP address, not HTTPS, posing a security risk. The content sent is the entire file read from the local system, which may contain sensitive information like SSL keys. The code does not verify the server's identity (no SSL/TLS verification), increasing man-in-the-middle risks. The code does not restrict or validate the contents or the file path, potentially allowing arbitrary file reading and data exfiltration. Overall, the code could be used maliciously to exfiltrate SSL keys or configuration data without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears designed to read a local SSL key file and send its contents to a remote server, potentially for malicious data exfiltration. The use of encoded strings and sending sensitive data over insecure channels raise security concerns. While the code could be part of a legitimate SSL configuration process, its obfuscation and potential for data theft suggest malicious or unintended behavior.",
