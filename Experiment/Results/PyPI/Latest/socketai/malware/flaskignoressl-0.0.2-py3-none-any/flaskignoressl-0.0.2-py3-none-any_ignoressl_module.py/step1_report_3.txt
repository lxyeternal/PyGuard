{
  "purpose": "The code appears to decode base64-encoded URLs and filenames, read a local file specified by a decoded path, and send its contents to a remote server via HTTP POST.",
  "sources": "Decodes base64 strings to obtain a URL (ssl_cert) and a filename (ssl_key), then reads the file at the decoded filename path.",
  "sinks": "Sends the contents of the decoded file to a remote server via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL.",
  "flows": "Decodes base64-encoded filename -> Checks if the file exists -> Reads the file content -> Decodes a URL -> Sends file content via POST request to the URL.",
  "anomalies": "The URL and filename are obfuscated with base64 encoding, which is often used to hide malicious activity. The code reads a local file specified dynamically and transmits its content to an external server, which could be used for exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64-encoded URL and filename, then checks for the existence of the filename as a path on the local system. If the file exists, it reads its contents and POSTs it to the decoded URL. The use of base64 encoding to obscure the URL and filename, combined with transmitting file contents to an external server, raises suspicion of data exfiltration or malicious control. The code lacks validation of the response content and does not log sensitive operations, which could further suggest malicious intent. No obvious malicious functions like reverse shells or system damage are present, but the pattern of obfuscation and data exfiltration behaviors are concerning.",
  "conclusion": "This code potentially performs malicious activity by exfiltrating local file data to a remote server using obfuscated URLs and filenames. While it may have legitimate uses, the obfuscation and data transmission pattern are typical of malicious or privacy-invasive scripts. Caution is advised.",
