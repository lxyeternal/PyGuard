  "purpose": "Decodes base64-encoded strings to obtain a URL and a file path, checks if the file exists, reads its content, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL.",

  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the decoded URL with the file content.",
  "flows": "Decodes base64 strings -> Checks file existence -> Reads file content -> Sends data via POST to URL.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated URL and file path via base64, minimal error handling, uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, transmits potentially sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes base64-encoded strings to obtain a URL and a file path, checks if the file exists, reads its content if present, and transmits this data via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL. The use of base64 encoding for strings and the transmission of local file contents to an external URL are suspicious, especially given the lack of validation and the insecure HTTP protocol. The code does not contain explicit malicious payloads but exhibits patterns typical of data exfiltration or configuration reporting. The minimal error handling and obfuscation increase the risk profile. Overall, the activity pattern suggests potential malicious intent, such as covert data exfiltration, but without concrete evidence of malicious payloads, it remains a suspicion rather than confirmed malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates suspicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration, leveraging obfuscation to hide its intent. While not definitively malicious, the pattern and context warrant high caution and further investigation. The activity should be treated as high risk, especially considering the obfuscation, unencrypted transmission, and potential for sensitive data leakage.",
