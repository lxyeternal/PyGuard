{
  "purpose": "Import and execute ssl_config() from a local module, likely to set SSL/TLS configurations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.module' when importing ssl_config.",
  "sinks": "Execution of ssl_config() could potentially modify system SSL settings or handle sensitive data, but specifics depend on its implementation.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; the sink is the call to ssl_config(), which executes the function potentially affecting system SSL configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the code snippet; it is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ssl_config from a local module and executes it. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of ssl_config(), which is not provided. The code itself is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Given the lack of implementation details, the risk is minimal but cannot be fully assessed. The reports correctly identify that the main concern is the internal behavior of ssl_config(). The malware score is appropriately zero, and the obfuscation score is zero. The risk score should be low, around 0.2, reflecting potential concerns if ssl_config() performs insecure configurations. Overall, the code appears safe, but a review of ssl_config()'s implementation is recommended for a definitive assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal and appears benign. The primary security concern hinges on the implementation of ssl_config(), which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low risk score (~0.2). Further review of ssl_config() is advised to confirm security posture.",
