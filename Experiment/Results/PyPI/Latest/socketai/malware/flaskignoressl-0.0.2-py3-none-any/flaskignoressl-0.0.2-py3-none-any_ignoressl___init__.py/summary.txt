  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal and appears benign. The primary security concern hinges on the implementation of ssl_config(), which cannot be assessed here. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low risk score (~0.2). Further review of ssl_config() is advised to confirm security posture."
