{
  "purpose": "The code imports a configuration function from a local module and executes it, likely to set up SSL/TLS settings.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.module import ssl_config), and execution of ssl_config()",
  "sinks": "Execution of ssl_config() potentially applies configuration settings; no explicit data sinks like network or file operations are shown",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> call to ssl_config() function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named ssl_config from a local module and executes it. There is no visible malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The simplicity suggests it is configuring SSL settings, which is common in secure applications. No external data inputs or sinks are present, and the code does not contain obfuscation or unusual constructs. Without inspecting the actual implementation of ssl_config(), no malicious actions can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple configuration call without malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. There are no signs of malware or malicious activity in this minimal code.",
