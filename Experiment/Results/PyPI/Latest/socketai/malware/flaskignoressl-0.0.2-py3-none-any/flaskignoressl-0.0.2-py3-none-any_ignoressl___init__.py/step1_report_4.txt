{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function called 'ssl_config' from a local module and then executes it, likely to configure SSL settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.module', specifically importing 'ssl_config'.",
  "sinks": "The 'ssl_config()' function call may act as a sink if it performs network configuration or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module 'ssl_config' into the execution of the function, which may modify system or network SSL settings.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; without inspecting 'ssl_config', no anomalies like hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are evident. The import is relative, which is typical in package code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a function and executes it. No suspicious or malicious code is directly visible. The security implications depend entirely on what 'ssl_config()' does, which is not provided. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior are apparent in this snippet. The minimalistic design reduces suspicion but does not rule out malicious intent if 'ssl_config' performs harmful actions internally.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior. The code's security risk is low; however, the actual safety depends on the implementation of 'ssl_config' in the imported module. Without further context, the overall risk remains minimal.",
