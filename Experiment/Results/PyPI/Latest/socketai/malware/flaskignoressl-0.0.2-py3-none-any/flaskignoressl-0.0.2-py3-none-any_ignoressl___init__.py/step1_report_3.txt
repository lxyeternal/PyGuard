{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named ssl_config from a local module and executes it, likely to configure SSL settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module .module to import ssl_config.",
  "sinks": "The code calls ssl_config(), which may internally perform network operations, handle sensitive data, or modify security settings.",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> execute ssl_config() function",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code is very simple and straightforward. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs are visible. Lack of context about ssl_config's implementation leaves uncertainty about its behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function ssl_config from a local module and immediately executes it. This is typical for configuration scripts, especially related to SSL or security settings. No external input is directly used, nor are there any suspicious constructs visible. The risk depends entirely on the implementation of ssl_config, which is not provided here. If ssl_config configures SSL certificates, protocols, or security parameters, it is generally benign. Without further details, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The code itself appears clean and simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import and function call with no obvious malicious intent. Its security implications depend on the implementation of ssl_config, which is not provided. Based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
