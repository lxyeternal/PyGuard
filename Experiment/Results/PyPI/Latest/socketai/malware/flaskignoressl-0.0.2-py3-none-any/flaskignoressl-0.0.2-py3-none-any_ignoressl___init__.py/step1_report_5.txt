{
  "purpose": "The code imports a configuration function related to SSL settings from a local module and executes it, likely to configure SSL parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (`.module`) and execution of `ssl_config()`",
  "sinks": "Execution of `ssl_config()` which may set SSL parameters; potential use of environment variables or configuration files within that function",
  "flows": "Import of `ssl_config()` from local module -> call to `ssl_config()` which likely applies configuration settings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the visible code; lacks detail about what `ssl_config()` does internally",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement and a function call. The function `ssl_config()` is imported from a local module, but its implementation is not shown. Without the implementation, we cannot determine if it performs insecure configurations or malicious actions. The code appears straightforward and typical for SSL configuration, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. However, reliance on the contents of `ssl_config()` without review leaves some uncertainty.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is simple and appears to be intended for SSL configuration. No immediate malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment alone. However, a review of the `ssl_config()` function implementation is recommended for a comprehensive security assessment.",
