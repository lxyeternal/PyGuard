  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'ssl_config' from a local module and executes it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; execution of ssl_config()",
  "sinks": "Execution of ssl_config() could potentially modify system SSL configurations or network behavior",
  "flows": "Import module -> execute ssl_config()",
  "anomalies": "No apparent anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a relative module and calls it immediately. Without the implementation details of 'ssl_config', it is unclear what actions are performed. If 'ssl_config' adjusts SSL settings, it could potentially weaken security or perform malicious configuration changes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are evident. The code is minimal and does not include obfuscation or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code's intent appears to be configuring SSL settings via a local module. Its security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'ssl_config'. Based solely on this snippet, there is no clear malicious behavior, but potential risks exist if 'ssl_config' performs insecure modifications.",
