{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named ssl_config from a local module and executes it, likely to configure SSL settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.module' and the ssl_config function within it.",
  "sinks": "The executed ssl_config function may perform configurations that could affect SSL behavior, but no direct data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input (imported function) flows into execution (calling ssl_config). No further flow information is available.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import syntax '.' is minimal but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or anomalies are apparent. The content of ssl_config() is unknown, so potential hidden behavior cannot be ruled out.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a function and executing it. Without the implementation of ssl_config(), we cannot determine its behavior. The import style is standard for local modules. There are no signs of malicious code in this snippet itself. Potential risks depend on what ssl_config() does, which is unknown here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. However, because the content of ssl_config() is unknown, some uncertainty remains. The code appears benign.",
