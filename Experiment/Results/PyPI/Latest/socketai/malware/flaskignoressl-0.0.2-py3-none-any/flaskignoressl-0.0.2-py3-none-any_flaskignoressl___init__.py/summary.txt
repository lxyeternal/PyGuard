  "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign and minimal. The security risk and malware scores are justified as low, given the absence of suspicious patterns. The primary uncertainty is the implementation of 'ssl_config()', which could alter the risk profile if malicious. Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture remains low risk, with confidence that the code itself is not malicious."
