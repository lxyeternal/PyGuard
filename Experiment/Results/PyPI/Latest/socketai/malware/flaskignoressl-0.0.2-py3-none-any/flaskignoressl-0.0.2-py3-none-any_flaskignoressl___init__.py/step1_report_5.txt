{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named ssl_config from a local module and then executes it, likely to configure SSL settings.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .module import ssl_config indicates reading from a local module file. The call to ssl_config() executes that function.",
  "sinks": "The execution of ssl_config() could potentially involve network operations or system configurations, but the specific behavior depends on the module's implementation, which is not provided.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing ssl_config from a local module and then invoking it immediately, which could trigger configuration routines that may involve network or system settings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident in this minimal code snippet. The import and function call appear standard; however, without the module's implementation, behavior cannot be fully assessed.",
  "analysis": "The code is very minimal: it imports a function from a local module and calls it. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs visible. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of ssl_config(). Since no malicious code or malicious behavior is apparent from this snippet alone, it appears benign. Nonetheless, the actual security impact is contingent on what ssl_config() does, which is unknown here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The code simply imports and executes a function, likely related to SSL configuration. Without additional context or the implementation of ssl_config(), this appears benign.",
