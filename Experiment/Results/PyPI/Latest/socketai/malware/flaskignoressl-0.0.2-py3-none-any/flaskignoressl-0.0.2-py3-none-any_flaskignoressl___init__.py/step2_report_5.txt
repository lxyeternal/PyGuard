  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe minimal code: importing a function `ssl_config` from a local module and executing it.\n- The core concern is whether `ssl_config()` performs malicious or insecure actions.\n- The implementation of `ssl_config()` is unknown in all cases, which limits definitive conclusions.\n- The reports assign malware scores of 0, indicating no suspicion of malicious behavior based solely on this snippet.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern without further context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Code Presence:\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code imports and executes `ssl_config()`. The code is present and straightforward.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code snippet itself. The logic is simple and standard.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Reasoning:\n- The reports appropriately acknowledge that the behavior of `ssl_config()` is unknown, which is crucial.\n- They correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the import and call.\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all emphasize that the actual behavior depends on `ssl_config()`'s implementation.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score (0):** Justified across all reports, as no malicious activity is indicated or suspected based on the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security risk scores:** They are low, reflecting the minimal code and unknown implementation. This seems reasonable.\n\n### Potential Issues:\n- Some reports assign a confidence level around 0.3 to 0.8, which is acceptable given the limited information.\n- The reports correctly highlight that the real security implications depend on `ssl_config()`'s implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are generally reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- Since all reports correctly identify the uncertainty regarding `ssl_config()`, no adjustments are necessary.\n- It might be worth noting that if `ssl_config()` were to perform insecure SSL configurations or network operations, the risk could increase. But without evidence, current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.2 (low, based on potential for `ssl_config()` to perform configurations, but no evidence of issues)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is minimal and appears benign. The real security implications depend on the implementation of `ssl_config()`, which is not provided. Given the current information, the scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and reasonable. No changes are needed. The overall risk remains low, with no indication of malware or obfuscation.",
