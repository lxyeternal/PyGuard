{
  "purpose": "Import and invoke a function named ssl_config from a local module to configure SSL settings.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .module import ssl_config' reads the ssl_config function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls ssl_config(), which may perform configuration or setup actions; potential data sinks depend on ssl_config implementation.",
  "flows": "Source (import) flows into the function call ssl_config().",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The module name is generic, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named ssl_config from a local module and immediately calls it. Without the implementation of ssl_config, it is not possible to determine if it performs malicious actions such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The code itself appears straightforward and does not contain obfuscated elements or malicious indicators. The only potential concern is the behavior of ssl_config, which is not visible here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The code simply imports and executes a function that likely configures SSL settings. However, the security implications depend entirely on the implementation of ssl_config, which is not provided.",
