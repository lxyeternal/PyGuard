{
  "purpose": "Import and invoke a function named ssl_config from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'ssl_config' from a local module './module'.",
  "sinks": "Calling the function 'ssl_config()' potentially executes code that could have side effects.",
  "flows": "Import source -> function invocation (ssl_config())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a relative module and immediately calls it. Without the implementation details of 'ssl_config', it's impossible to determine if it performs malicious actions. The code itself is minimal and straightforward, with no visible malicious patterns or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import and function call with no evident malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet. It appears benign but depends on the implementation of 'ssl_config'.",
