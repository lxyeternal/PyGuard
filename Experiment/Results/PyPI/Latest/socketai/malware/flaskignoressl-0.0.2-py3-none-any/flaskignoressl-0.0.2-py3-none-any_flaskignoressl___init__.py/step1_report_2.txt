{
  "purpose": "The code imports a configuration function named ssl_config from a local module and executes it, likely to set up SSL-related settings.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .module import ssl_config is the source of code execution; the call to ssl_config() executes the function.",
  "sinks": "The function call ssl_config() is a potential sink if the function contains malicious code, such as network activity or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input (imported module) flows into execution at ssl_config(), which may perform further actions; however, the code provided does not specify internal behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and relies entirely on the ssl_config() implementation; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are visible here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a relative module and executes it. The maliciousness or security risk depends entirely on the implementation of ssl_config in the imported module. There are no obvious malicious behaviors or anomalies in this snippet. The structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign. The security risk and malware likelihood cannot be accurately assessed without inspecting the ssl_config() implementation. There are no overt malicious indicators in this fragment.",
