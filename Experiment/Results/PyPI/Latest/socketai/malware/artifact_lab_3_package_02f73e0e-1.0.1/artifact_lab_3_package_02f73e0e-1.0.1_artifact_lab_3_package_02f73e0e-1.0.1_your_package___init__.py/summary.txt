  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and appropriate given the minimal or absent code. The overall security posture appears low risk, with no malicious activity detected. Minor adjustments, such as lowering the security risk score in Report 3 from 0.2 to 0.1, could be considered for increased precision, but current scores are justified. No further action required."
