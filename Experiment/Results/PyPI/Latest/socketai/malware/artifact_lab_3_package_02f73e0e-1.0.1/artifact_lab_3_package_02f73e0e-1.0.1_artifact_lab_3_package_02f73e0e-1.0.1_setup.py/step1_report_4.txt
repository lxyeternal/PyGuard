{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate environment variables by sending them to an external server, disguised as a package setup script.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables), requests.post (HTTP request to external server)",
  "sinks": "requests.post (sending environment data to remote server)",
  "flows": "The environment variables are read from os.environ and directly sent via requests.post to an external URL",
  "anomalies": "Function leak_env() is called unconditionally at import time, immediately exfiltrating environment variables; the setup script appears malicious and is used to disguise data exfiltration as package setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries 'setuptools' and 'os', then imports 'requests'. It defines a function 'leak_env()' that captures all environment variables and sends them to an external URL using an HTTP POST request. This function is invoked immediately upon script execution, leading to automatic exfiltration of environment data without user consent. The setup() function describes a package but appears to serve as a cover for the malicious data leak. The code does not perform any other legitimate setup activities beyond this exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by secretly exfiltrating environment variables to an external server during package setup, indicating malicious intent. The package itself appears fake and is used as a vehicle for data theft.",
