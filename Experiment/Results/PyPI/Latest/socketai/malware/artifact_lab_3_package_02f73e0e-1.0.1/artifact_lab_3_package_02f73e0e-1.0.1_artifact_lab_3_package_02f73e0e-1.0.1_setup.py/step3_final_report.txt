  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates environment variables to an external server during module import, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables), executed immediately upon import",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to external URL, sending environment data",
  "flows": "leak_env() reads os.environ -> requests.post() sends data to URL",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of leak_env() during import, suspicious ngrok URL, package description explicitly states malicious purpose",
  "analysis": "The code defines leak_env() which captures all environment variables and sends them via POST request to a suspicious URL. The function is invoked immediately upon import, causing data exfiltration without user consent. The setup() call is standard but is used as a cover for malicious activity. The URL and package description confirm malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and performs active data theft, which is inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 1, securityRisk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the behavior. The immediate exfiltration during package setup poses a severe security threat, justifying maximum scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a malicious backdoor actively exfiltrating environment variables during package import. The behavior is explicit, and the scores (malware: 1, risk: 1, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate. The package should be flagged as dangerous.",
