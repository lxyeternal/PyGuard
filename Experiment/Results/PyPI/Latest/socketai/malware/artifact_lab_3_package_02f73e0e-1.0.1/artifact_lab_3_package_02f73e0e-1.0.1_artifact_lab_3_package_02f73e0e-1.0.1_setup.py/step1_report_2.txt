{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to exfiltrate environment variables by sending them to an external server, likely for malicious data theft or privacy invasion.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables using os.environ.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via requests.post to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are captured and immediately sent to an external server (sink) during module execution.",
  "anomalies": "The function leak_env() automatically executes upon import, sending potentially sensitive environment data without user consent. The URL used is suspicious, potentially a tunnel or malicious endpoint. The package description suggests malicious intent ('Fake package to exfiltrate environment variables').",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and requests modules, then defines a function leak_env() that collects all environment variables and posts them to an external URL. The function is called immediately upon script execution, which means any import of this package will trigger data exfiltration. The setup() call defines package metadata but does not prevent the malicious behavior. The use of a suspicious ngrok URL indicates potential malicious activity aimed at collecting environment data for exploitation or privacy breach.",
  "conclusion": "The code explicitly leaks environment variables to an external server without user knowledge or consent, indicating malicious intent. The package is designed as a backdoor for data exfiltration, posing a significant security risk.",
