{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a Python package setup but includes a function to exfiltrate environment variables to an external server, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The environment variables are read from os.environ within the leak_env() function.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() function sends data to an external URL, exfiltrating environment variables.",
  "flows": "The environment variables are captured by leak_env(), then sent via requests.post() to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The leak_env() function immediately executes upon import, sending sensitive environment data without any user consent or indication. The target URL appears suspicious and unrelated to typical package functions. The package setup function is standard but is used here to mask malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and a third-party requests library, then defines leak_env() to send environment variables to an external server. The function is called immediately upon import, leading to data exfiltration without user knowledge. The setup() function is typical for Python packages but is likely a cover for malicious activity. The external URL is unusual and indicates malicious intent. No other suspicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate environment variables to an external server immediately upon import, likely for data theft or reconnaissance. It masquerades as a legitimate package setup but contains malicious behavior.",
