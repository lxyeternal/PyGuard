{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameter 'private_str' (although unused), method parameters 'digest', 'encoded_sig'.",
  "sinks": "Methods are abstract; no sinks or data leaks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No execution flow occurs within this snippet as methods are abstract; no data flow is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "Unused parameter 'private_str' in __init__, but this alone is not suspicious; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with abstract methods related to cryptographic signing. There is no implementation provided, only method signatures. The constructor includes an unused parameter, which may suggest incomplete code or a placeholder. No actual code execution, data handling, or security risks are present in this snippet. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a boilerplate for a signing interface, with no executable logic, data processing, or security issues. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. The presence of an unused parameter is benign and likely part of a design pattern.",
