  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'private_str' in the constructor, class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Methods that perform cryptographic operations ('to_public', 'to_wif', 'sign', 'verify') which could process sensitive data, but are not implemented here.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only defines an interface with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a straightforward abstract class definition with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract class 'Signer' with an optional 'private_str' parameter intended for subclasses to implement cryptographic signing behavior. No executable logic or data processing occurs in this snippet; it only defines method signatures. The constructor accepts a parameter but does not store or process it, leaving room for subclasses to handle sensitive data. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The structure is standard for interface definitions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign interface for cryptographic signers with no malicious intent or security risks present. It provides an abstract blueprint for subclasses to implement signing-related methods. No anomalies, malware, or security issues are evident in this fragment.",
