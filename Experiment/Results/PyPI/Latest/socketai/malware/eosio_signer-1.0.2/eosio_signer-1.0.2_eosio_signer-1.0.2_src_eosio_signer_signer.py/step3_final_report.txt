  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Signer' with cryptographic signing interface methods.",
  "sources": "None; all methods are abstract, no data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; abstract method signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Unused parameter 'private_str' in constructor; unusual but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract class serving as an interface for cryptographic signers. The 'private_str' parameter is accepted but not stored or used, which suggests incomplete implementation or a placeholder for subclasses. There are no embedded secrets, malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The absence of executable logic and data flow indicates a benign pattern. All reports correctly identify the code as an interface with no malicious intent, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risks. The minor anomaly of the unused parameter does not constitute a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract interface for cryptographic signing with no malicious or security issues. The unused parameter is typical in abstract classes and does not imply malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
