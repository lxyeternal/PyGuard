  "purpose": "Import the EOSIOKey class from the key module within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module (.key).",
  "sinks": "None directly observed; import statement itself does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A – only an import statement, no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import of the EOSIOKey class from the key module within the same package. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. This is a standard import statement in Python. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard Python syntax used to access classes or functions from a local module.",
