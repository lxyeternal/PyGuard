  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow evident in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement using relative import syntax. It does not contain any executable code, user input handling, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. Since it is only an import statement, it is not possible to determine the content or potential maliciousness of the imported module without further context.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears benign and standard for modular Python projects.",
