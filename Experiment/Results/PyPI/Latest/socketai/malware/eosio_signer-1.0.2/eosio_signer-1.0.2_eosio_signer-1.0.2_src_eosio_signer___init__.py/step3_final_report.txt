{
  "purpose": "Import the EOSIOKey class from a local key module, likely for cryptographic or key management purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads from the local module '.key'.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; no data or untrusted input is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "Importing the class from the module; no data flow or execution beyond the import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of a class from a local module. No data processing, network activity, or user input handling is present. The import statement is standard and benign. The security and malware scores are appropriately set to 0, reflecting no malicious intent. Confidence is high due to the simplicity; no anomalies or malicious behavior are detected. The risk is minimal, contingent on the content of the imported class, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears safe and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis. Further security assessment should focus on the contents of the 'key' module and the 'EOSIOKey' class, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
