{
  "purpose": "The code imports the EOSIOKey class from the local key module, likely used for handling cryptographic keys or blockchain-related operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing EOSIOKey from a local module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow visible beyond the import statement",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only involves a single import; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which is standard in Python for modular code organization. It references a local module '.key' and imports 'EOSIOKey'. There are no embedded or hidden behaviors, no data processing, no network activity, and no other suspicious operations visible. The minimal nature limits the assessment but does not indicate malicious intent. The import suggests further code elsewhere utilizes EOSIOKey, but this cannot be evaluated from the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is a normal part of Python code structure.",
