  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports describe a simple Python import statement:\n   ```python\n   from .key import EOSIOKey\n   ```\n   There are no indications of code execution, data processing, or any malicious activity. The code is purely structural, importing a class from a local module.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is a benign import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk scores are also mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1, which seems reasonable given the minimal code. The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 or 1), reflecting certainty about benignity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is a straightforward import with no data handling, network activity, or obfuscation, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent. This is consistent with the code snippet.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge that the snippet alone cannot reveal the contents or potential maliciousness of the imported module. This cautious approach is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0 (or very close to zero)  \n\n**Rationale**:  \nThe code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. Without additional context—such as the contents of the `key` module or how `EOSIOKey` is used—there's no basis for higher risk scores.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. No changes are necessary. The code snippet itself is benign, and the scores reflect that.",
