  "purpose": "To define and configure the packaging details for the 'coinanalysis' Python project for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data read operations present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The license string 'Python Script' is unusual but not malicious. No obfuscated or malicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and extras. The only dependency is blessings, which is a terminal styling library. No external data inputs or network operations are present. The script lacks any code that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. The license field is non-standard but not harmful.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and is typical for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
