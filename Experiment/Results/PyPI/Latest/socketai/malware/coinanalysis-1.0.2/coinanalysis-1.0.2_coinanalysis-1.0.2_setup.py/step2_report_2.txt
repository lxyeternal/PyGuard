  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and does not process untrusted data or perform any dynamic actions.\n- The only noted anomaly is the license field set to \"Python Script,\" which is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code; all reports correctly identify it as benign.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, security risk:** All are scored as 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Dependencies:** The specified dependencies (`blessings` and `pytest`) are benign and standard for development dependencies.\n- **License field:** Unusual but not harmful; does not impact security.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- The scores given are consistent with the analysis.\n- Since there's no malicious activity, malware score remains at 0.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low (0), reflecting no security concern.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The risk score is 0 because the code does not execute any untrusted input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated/malicious code.\n- The malware score is 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- The license string \"Python Script\" is unconventional but not malicious. It might be a misconfiguration or poor practice, but it doesn't introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed reviews, I concur with the scores and conclusions. The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident. The code is a typical setup script with benign dependencies and no dynamic or external data handling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The setup script is a standard, safe package configuration with no security concerns.",
