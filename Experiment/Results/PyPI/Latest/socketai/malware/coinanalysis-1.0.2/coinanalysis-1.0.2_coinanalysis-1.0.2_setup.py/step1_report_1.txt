{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'coinanalysis' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for package metadata; 'install_requires' and 'extras_require' specify dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no data leaks or malicious data flows.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or untrusted data flow present; setup configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The license 'Python Script' is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. No input handling, no data processing, and no suspicious code execution. The dependencies specified are benign; 'blessings' is a terminal styling library. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The overall structure and content are typical of a standard setup.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe for use.",
