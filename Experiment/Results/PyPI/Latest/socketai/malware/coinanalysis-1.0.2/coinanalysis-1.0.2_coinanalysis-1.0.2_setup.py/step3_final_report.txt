  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and optional extras.",
  "sources": "No runtime input or external data; static code defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional license string 'Python Script', but not malicious or risky.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script employing setuptools to specify package name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extras. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network operations, or obfuscated elements. Dependencies are benign ('blessings' and 'pytest'), and the license string, while unusual, does not pose security concerns. No suspicious patterns, code injection, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The only minor note is the non-standard license string, which does not impact security but could be clarified for correctness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
