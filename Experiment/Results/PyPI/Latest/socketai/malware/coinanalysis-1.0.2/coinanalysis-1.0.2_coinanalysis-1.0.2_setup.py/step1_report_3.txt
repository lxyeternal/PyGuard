{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'coinanalysis' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata such as package name, version, description, author, license, and dependency requirements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security issues; no execution of external code or dynamic evaluation.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup configuration is static and does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures are present. The 'license' field set as 'Python Script' is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static package metadata. All fields contain normal package info. The 'install_requires' specifies a dependency with a version specifier, and 'extras_require' specifies development dependencies. There are no code execution, dynamic imports, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares package metadata and dependencies without executing or processing external inputs.",
