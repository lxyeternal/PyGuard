{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'coinanalysis' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() function parameters (name, version, description, packages, author, license, install_requires, extras_require). No input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions. No code execution, network communication, or data handling that could lead to leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines package metadata without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The license is set to 'Python Script', which is unconventional and does not specify a recognized license. No other anomalies or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module named 'coinanalysis'. It specifies dependencies, metadata, and optional development requirements. The absence of dynamic code, input handling, or external data sources indicates no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The license field uses a non-standard value, but this alone is not malicious; it may reflect poor licensing practice.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The main concern is the unconventional license string, which should be clarified but does not impact security.",
