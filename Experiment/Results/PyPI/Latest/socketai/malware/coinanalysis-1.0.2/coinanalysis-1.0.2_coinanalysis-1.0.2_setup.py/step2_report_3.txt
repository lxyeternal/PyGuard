  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static setup.py configuration.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data handling, or network communication is present.\n- The dependencies are benign: 'blessings' (terminal styling) and 'pytest' (testing).\n- The license field is set to \"Python Script,\" which is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- None of the reports identify any code flaws, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The risk scores are all 0 or 1, with the highest being 1, justified by the confidence and benign analysis.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The license string \"Python Script\" is unusual but not harmful. It might reflect poor licensing practice but does not introduce security risks.\n- The code does not perform any runtime operations, making exploitation or malicious activity impossible in this context.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate; the code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0 or 1) are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to unconventional license string, but negligible)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code appears safe, with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is the license string, which could be clarified but does not impact security.",
