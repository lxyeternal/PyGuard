{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'coinanalysis', specifying metadata and dependencies for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata from the setup() function parameters, including package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data handling, user inputs, or external data outputs in this script.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources leading to sinks; the code only configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard setuptools syntax. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies. The only dependencies are 'blessings' and 'pytest' in optional dev extras. There are no dynamic or malicious code elements, no data handling, or external communication. The code does not include obfuscation, code injection, or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
