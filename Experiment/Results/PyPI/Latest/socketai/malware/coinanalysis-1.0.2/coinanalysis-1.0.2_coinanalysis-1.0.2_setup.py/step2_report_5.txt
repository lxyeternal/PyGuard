  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, static setup.py configuration.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data, or code execution is present.\n- The dependencies are benign: 'blessings' (terminal styling) and 'pytest' (testing).\n- The license field is set to \"Python Script,\" which is unconventional but not malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- None of the reports identify any actual vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting high certainty about the benign nature.\n- The license string being unconventional does not impact security but could be flagged as a documentation or licensing concern rather than a security issue.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** All evidence points to a legitimate, safe package setup script.",
