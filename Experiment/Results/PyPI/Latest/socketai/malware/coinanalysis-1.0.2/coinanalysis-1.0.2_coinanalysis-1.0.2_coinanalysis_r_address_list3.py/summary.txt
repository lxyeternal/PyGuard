  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated base64 strings that decode to URLs pointing to potentially malicious domains. While no active malicious behavior is confirmed, the obfuscation and external URL patterns are indicative of malicious payloads. The scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting a high suspicion level. Further decoding and monitoring are advised before deployment or execution."
