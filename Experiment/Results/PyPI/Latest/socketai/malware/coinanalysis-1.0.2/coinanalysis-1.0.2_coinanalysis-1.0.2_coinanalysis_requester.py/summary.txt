  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wallet monitoring script with minor operational flaws, such as ineffective transaction deduplication and lack of exit conditions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
