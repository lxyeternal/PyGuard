  "purpose": "Monitor Bitcoin wallets for balance changes and new transactions, logging activity and playing notification sounds.",
  "sources": "User-provided wallet data (wallets parameter), wallet addresses from the wallet list, external API call to blockchain.info.",
  "sinks": "Writing logs to a specified file, printing to console, playing sound notifications, making HTTP requests to external API.",
  "flows": "Wallet data input -> API request to blockchain.info -> Response processing -> Log output and sound notification",
  "anomalies": "Use of an infinite loop with no exit condition, potential unbounded memory growth in processed_transactions set, external sound file playback without validation, repeated API calls without rate limiting, use of requests.get with unvalidated URL construction in 'requester' function.",
  "analysis": "The code continuously monitors specified wallets for balance and transaction updates, fetching data from blockchain.info. It logs changes and plays a sound notification. The 'processed_transactions' set aims to prevent duplicate processing but is reset each iteration, reducing its effectiveness. The external 'requester' function constructs a URL insecurely without validation, but its usage appears limited. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The overall structure is straightforward but includes potentially unnecessary or risky features such as infinite looping, unbounded set growth, and unvalidated external sound files.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs wallet monitoring with logging and notifications but does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. Some design choices like infinite looping and unbounded data structures could cause operational issues but are not malicious. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration is detected.",
