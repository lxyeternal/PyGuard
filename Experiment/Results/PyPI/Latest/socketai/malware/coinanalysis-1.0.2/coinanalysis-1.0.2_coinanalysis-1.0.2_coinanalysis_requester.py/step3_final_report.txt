  "purpose": "Monitor Bitcoin wallets for balance changes and new transactions, logging activity and playing notification sounds.",
  "sources": "API responses from blockchain.info for each wallet; wallet data provided as input; file I/O for logging; sound file playback.",
  "sinks": "Console output, log file, sound playback, network requests to blockchain.info.",
  "flows": "API response data fetched in requests.get() -> parsed as JSON -> balance and transaction data processed -> logs and notifications generated -> sound played upon new transaction detection.",
  "anomalies": "Re-initialization of 'processed_transactions' set each loop prevents cross-iteration deduplication; unused 'requester' function; missing import statements for 'time' and 'datetime'; infinite loop with no exit condition; external sound file playback without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs wallet monitoring by periodically querying blockchain.info for each wallet address, detecting balance changes and new transactions, and logging these events. It plays a sound notification for each new transaction detected. The main operational flaw is the re-initialization of 'processed_transactions' each cycle, which prevents effective duplicate detection across iterations. The 'requester' function is unused, serving no purpose. Missing imports suggest incomplete code but do not impact security. No malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are present. External API calls are standard, and no data exfiltration or malicious network activity is observed. The code is straightforward and benign, with only operational issues that could be improved for robustness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wallet monitoring script with minor operational flaws, such as ineffective transaction deduplication and lack of exit conditions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
