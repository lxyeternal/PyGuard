      "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration by sending system hostname info to an external server during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The activity should be flagged as malicious, and the package should not be trusted."

      "conclusion": "The script is primarily a data exfiltration tool that collects system info and sends it to an external server. While not containing complex malware payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a high likelihood of malicious activity, with malware score around 0.8 and security risk around 0.8."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through data exfiltration of system hostname and directory contents to an external server. The activity is suspicious, privacy-invasive, and potentially malicious. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend a malware score of 0.9, obfuscation score of 0, and a security risk score of 0.9 to reflect the severity of the exfiltration activity."

      "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates a high potential for malicious activity due to external network contact via shell command. The malware score is set at 0.7 reflecting significant suspicion, with a security risk score of 0.7. No obfuscation is present. Overall, the code is suspicious and should be reviewed further, especially considering the external domain involved."

      "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data exfiltration by sending system hostname and directory information to an external server, indicating malicious or spyware-like behavior. It lacks safeguards, making it a security concern. The activity is consistent with data-harvesting malware, warranting high malware and security risk scores."
