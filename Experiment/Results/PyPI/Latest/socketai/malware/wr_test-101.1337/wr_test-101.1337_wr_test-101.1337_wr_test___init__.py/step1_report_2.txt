{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect the current directory listing and hostname information, then send this data to a remote server via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Reading current working directory with os.listdir(), reading hostname with os.uname()[1]",
  "sinks": "Executing shell commands via os.system() to send data to remote server and possibly for further commands",
  "flows": "os.listdir() and os.uname() outputs are combined into 'data', which is sent to remote server using curl via os.system() in both the main code and run() function",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to perform network requests to a suspicious domain (jacobsandum.com). The data is constructed by concatenating hostname and directory listing without sanitization. The code does not validate or restrict data before transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information—current directory listing and hostname—and sends it to an external server. The use of os.system() with a URL on a suspicious domain indicates potential data exfiltration. The run() function repeats the same network call, possibly intended for repeated data exfiltration. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious backdoor code; however, the behavior of collecting and transmitting system info to an external server is suspicious and potentially malicious, depending on user intent. The data is transmitted unencrypted and without user consent, raising security and privacy concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data collection from the system and exfiltrates it to an external server via HTTP requests. This behavior suggests malicious intent, such as data theft or remote command and control. The absence of safeguards and the connection to a suspicious domain increase security risk. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is also high.",
