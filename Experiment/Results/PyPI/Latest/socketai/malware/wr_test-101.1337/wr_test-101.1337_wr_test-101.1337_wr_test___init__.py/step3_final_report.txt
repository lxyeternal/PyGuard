{
  "purpose": "The code collects system hostname and directory listing, then exfiltrates this information to an external server via HTTP GET requests using curl executed through os.system().",
  "sources": "os.uname()[1] for hostname, os.listdir() for directory contents",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing curl commands to send data to http://jacobsandum.com:8000/",
  "flows": "hostname and directory data are concatenated into a string and passed as URL parameters in curl commands executed via os.system()",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with concatenated URLs for data exfiltration; no sanitization or encryption; repeated transmission via run() function",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data collection of hostname and directory listing, then exfiltrates this data to an external server using unencrypted HTTP requests via os.system(). The behavior indicates an intent to gather and send system information without user consent. No obfuscation or payloads are present; the code is simple and direct. The suspicious activity is confirmed by the external communication to a potentially malicious domain. The use of os.system() with concatenated URLs is insecure and typical of malicious exfiltration scripts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.8-0.9, security risk around 0.85-0.9, obfuscation 0) are consistent with this activity. The high scores are justified given the privacy invasion and data theft implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through data exfiltration of system hostname and directory contents to an external server. The activity is suspicious, privacy-invasive, and potentially malicious. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend a malware score of 0.9, obfuscation score of 0, and a security risk score of 0.9 to reflect the severity of the exfiltration activity.",
