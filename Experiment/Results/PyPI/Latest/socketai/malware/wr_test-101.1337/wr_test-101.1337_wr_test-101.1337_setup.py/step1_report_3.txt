{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools, primarily for testing supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The hostname is retrieved via os.uname()[1], and an external command is executed with os.system() to send an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain, including the hostname as a parameter.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a command that makes an HTTP request, potentially transmitting data to an external server.",
  "flows": "The hostname (source) is used to construct a URL in os.system(), which then makes a network request to an external server, potentially transmitting hostname data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of os.system() to perform a network request during package setup, especially to a suspicious domain 'jacobsandum.com'. The domain appears unrelated to the package purpose and may be malicious. The code retrieves hostname and then immediately sends it out without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools and retrieves the system's hostname via os.uname()[1]. If hostname retrieval fails, it defaults to 'failed'. It then executes a curl command via os.system() to send a GET request to 'http://jacobsandum.com:1337/setup-' concatenated with the hostname, which is suspicious. The setup() call defines package metadata, but the critical malicious activity is the network request that leaks system information to an external server. This behavior indicates possible data exfiltration or malicious command execution during package installation. No other malicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a seemingly benign package setup but contains malicious behavior by sending system hostname data to an external server without consent. This indicates potential supply chain sabotage, data exfiltration, or malicious activity. It should be considered dangerous and unsuitable for use.",
