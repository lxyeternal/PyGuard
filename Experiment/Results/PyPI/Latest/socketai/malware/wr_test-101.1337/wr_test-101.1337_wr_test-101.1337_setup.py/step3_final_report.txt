{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the system hostname and sends it via a curl request to an external server during package setup, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious control.",
  "sources": "os.uname()[1] to obtain hostname; os.system() executing curl command with hostname as part of URL.",
  "sinks": "The curl command executed via os.system() sends hostname data to external domain.",
  "flows": "Source (hostname) obtained from os.uname()[1] -> used in URL string -> executed by os.system() to send data to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional network request during setup without validation; sending hostname info to a suspicious domain; no obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the hostname and immediately exfiltrates it via an external HTTP request during package setup, which is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. The request targets a non-standard domain, suggesting potential data theft or command-and-control activity. No obfuscation or other malicious code is present. The network activity during setup is a classic indicator of supply chain sabotage or privacy invasion. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the malicious intent is high. The main concern is data exfiltration, which justifies a high malware and security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration by sending system hostname info to an external server during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The activity should be flagged as malicious, and the package should not be trusted.",
