{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'wr_test' with metadata and package configuration, including a suspicious remote request.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname using os.uname() and constructs a URL for a system call; it also executes an os.system() command to perform an HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes a curl command that sends an HTTP request to a potentially malicious domain with hostname data.",
  "flows": "Hostname is obtained via os.uname(), then inserted into a curl command executed through os.system(), sending data to http://jacobsandum.com:1337/setup-[hostname].",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes dynamically executing a system command to send system data to an external server, and the use of 'curl' within os.system() without validation. The description comment also suggests the package is not intended for production use but for testing, which may be a disguise.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the system hostname and immediately uses os.system() to send a request to an external server, potentially leaking system information. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or a command-and-control mechanism. The package setup appears standard but is accompanied by malicious activity hidden within the script. The presence of a remote request during setup is suspicious and could be used to trigger malicious actions or gather system info without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior, notably the transmission of system information to a remote server during package setup. This indicates a supply chain attack vector or malicious package behavior, with a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
