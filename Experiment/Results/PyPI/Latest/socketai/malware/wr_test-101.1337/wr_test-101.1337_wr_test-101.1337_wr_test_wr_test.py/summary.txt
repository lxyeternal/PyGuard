  "conclusion": "The script is primarily a data exfiltration tool that collects system info and sends it to an external server. While not containing complex malware payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a high likelihood of malicious activity, with malware score around 0.8 and security risk around 0.8."
