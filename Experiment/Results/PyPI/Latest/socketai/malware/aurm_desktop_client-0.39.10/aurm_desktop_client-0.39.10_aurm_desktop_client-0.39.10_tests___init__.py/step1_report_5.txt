  "purpose": "To initialize the tests package by exposing the test_function from module1 for external use during testing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1 to access test_function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data processing or output functions are included",
  "flows": "Import of test_function from module1; no data flow or untrusted data transfer observed",
  "anomalies": "Simple import and __all__ declaration; no unusual code, secrets, or obfuscated constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, typical for a test package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data leaks, no code injections, or obfuscation. The code is minimal and straightforward, focusing solely on package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package initializer for testing purposes, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
