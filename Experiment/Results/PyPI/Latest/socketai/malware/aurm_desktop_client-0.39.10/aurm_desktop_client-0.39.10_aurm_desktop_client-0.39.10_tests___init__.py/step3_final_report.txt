  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing 'test_function' from the local module 'module1' and exposes it via '__all__'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.module1' and the '__all__' declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external communication, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'test_function' from local module; no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer with an import and an export list. No suspicious or malicious code, data flows, or external communications are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0, with high confidence. No anomalies or obfuscation detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent. No changes or further analysis are necessary.",
