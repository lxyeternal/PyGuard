  "purpose": "Initialize the tests package and expose 'test_function' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "None, as the code only performs a module import and exports a symbol",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package initializer that imports 'test_function' from a sibling module 'module1' and defines '__all__' for exports. It performs no data processing, input/output, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple package initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
