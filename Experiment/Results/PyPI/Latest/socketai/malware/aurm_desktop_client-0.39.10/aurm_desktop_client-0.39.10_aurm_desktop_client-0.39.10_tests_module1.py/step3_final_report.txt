  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static string, serving as a benign test module.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, dependencies, or data sources; static code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static return value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward function with no inputs, outputs, dependencies, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data leakage, or code injection. Given the lack of external interactions or sensitive operations, the overall security assessment is that the code is entirely safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward test function with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
