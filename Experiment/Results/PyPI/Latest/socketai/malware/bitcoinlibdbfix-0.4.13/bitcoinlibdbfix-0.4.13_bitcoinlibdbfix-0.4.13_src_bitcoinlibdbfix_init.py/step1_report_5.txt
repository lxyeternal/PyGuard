  "purpose": "To import core functions and version info, and run pre-install checks if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules 'cli', 'version', and conditional import of 'installer'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'run_pre_install()' function if it executes untrusted code, but likely not in this context.",
  "flows": "Importing modules -> conditional execution of 'run_pre_install()' during import.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of 'run_pre_install()' during module import is somewhat unusual; however, it's a common pattern for pre-install checks and does not inherently indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and exposes 'main' and '__version__'. It attempts to import 'run_pre_install' from '.installer' and executes it if present. The execution occurs during import time, which is typical for setup or installation scripts. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward, with a fallback in case 'installer' is not available.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing standard initialization and pre-install checks without any signs of malicious intent. The execution of 'run_pre_install()' during import is typical for setup routines and does not pose security concerns in this context.",
