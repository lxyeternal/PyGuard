  "purpose": "This module appears to set up package exports and run pre-install checks during import.",
  "sources": "The import of run_pre_install from .installer, which is executed immediately if available.",
  "sinks": "None directly. The run_pre_install function may perform actions during import.",
  "flows": "Importing and executing run_pre_install during module import.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of run_pre_install upon import could be unusual if its purpose is not clear or documented. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exports __all__, imports main and __version__, and attempts to run run_pre_install from the installer module if available. The try-except block suppresses ImportError, preventing failure if installer is missing. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The immediate execution of run_pre_install could be used for setup or checks, but without knowing its implementation, this is standard practice in some packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the automatic invocation of run_pre_install during import, which is typical for pre-install checks but should be reviewed for its actual implementation. No malware signals detected.",
