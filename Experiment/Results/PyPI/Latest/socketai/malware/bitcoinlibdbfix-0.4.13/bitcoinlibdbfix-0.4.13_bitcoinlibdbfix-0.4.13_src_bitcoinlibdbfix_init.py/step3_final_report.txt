  "anomalies": "Execution of 'run_pre_install()' during import is a pattern that can be exploited if the function contains malicious code; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and attempts to run a pre-install function during import, handling missing modules gracefully. This pattern is common in setup routines but can be risky if the function is malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and assign a malware score of 0, given no evidence of malicious activity. Risk scores vary slightly, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of the pattern's potential risk. The code is clear, straightforward, and lacks obfuscation. Without inspecting 'run_pre_install()', the risk remains theoretical; scores appropriately reflect this uncertainty.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with a pre-install hook executed during import. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The potential security concern is the execution of code during import, which is a common pattern but could be exploited if the function is malicious. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low risk score (~0.2). Continuous review of 'run_pre_install()' is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code.",
