  "purpose": "This code imports core functions and version information, and attempts to run a pre-install check if available.",

  "flows": "Import of run_pre_install from installer module -> execution during import if available",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of run_pre_install may execute code during module import; no visible malicious code, but execution at import could be suspicious if run_pre_install is malicious",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions and version info, then attempts to run run_pre_install during import if available. The try-except block suppresses ImportError, which is standard. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The only potential concern is the automatic execution of run_pre_install during import, which could execute arbitrary code if the installer module is malicious or compromised. However, this pattern alone is not inherently malicious but could be abused.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module setup with a conditional pre-install check. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The automatic execution of run_pre_install during import could be considered a risk if the installer module is compromised, but this pattern is not uncommon in package setup routines.",
