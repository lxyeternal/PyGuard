  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with a pre-install hook executed during import. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The potential security concern is the execution of code during import, which is a common pattern but could be exploited if the function is malicious. Scores are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low risk score (~0.2). Continuous review of 'run_pre_install()' is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code."
