{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some basic data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of comments or descriptive variable names.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters and possibly environment variables (if any are used), though explicit sources are not clearly identified in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations, file writing, or executing system commands if present, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Without specific code provided, no clear source-to-sink data flow can be identified. If input or data is processed and then used in sensitive operations, that would be relevant.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code appears straightforward but lacks comments for clarity.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited due to the absence of actual code content. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity are evident. The structure and formatting do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. Without further code, the likelihood of malicious behavior is low, but the lack of context prevents a definitive conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign but incomplete for a thorough assessment.",
