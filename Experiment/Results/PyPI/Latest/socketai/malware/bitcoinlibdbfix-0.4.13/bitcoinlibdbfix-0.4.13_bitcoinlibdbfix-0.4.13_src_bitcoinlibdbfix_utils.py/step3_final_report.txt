{
  "purpose": "Assess the security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code summaries, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No actual code snippets provided; assessments based on descriptions of code behavior and structure.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows to network, file system, or environment variables, but no explicit untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Descriptions suggest data processing and possible environment or network interactions, but no concrete source-to-sink paths are detailed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; mentions of dynamic features are hypothetical, not evidenced.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. Confidence levels vary but are generally high, reflecting the limited code visibility. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), appropriate given the benign descriptions. The assessments are internally consistent and conservative, considering the lack of concrete code evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe based on the summaries; no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the provided information.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
