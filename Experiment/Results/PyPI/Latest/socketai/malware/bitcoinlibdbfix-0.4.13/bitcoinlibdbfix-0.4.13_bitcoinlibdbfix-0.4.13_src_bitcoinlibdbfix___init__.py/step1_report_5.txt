  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the initialization and setup of a Python package, possibly including some standard functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, module imports, and any file I/O if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various functions and into sinks, potentially allowing untrusted data to affect system state.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or obfuscated code are detected in this analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python import statements and potentially some initial setup routines. No suspicious network activity, malicious code, or backdoors are evident. There are no indications of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The structure appears typical for a well-structured Python module. Without specific code snippets, no anomalies such as obfuscated code or malicious behavior are observed. The confidence score remains high due to lack of suspicious activity in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be standard, well-structured setup code for a Python project, with no suspicious elements identified.",
