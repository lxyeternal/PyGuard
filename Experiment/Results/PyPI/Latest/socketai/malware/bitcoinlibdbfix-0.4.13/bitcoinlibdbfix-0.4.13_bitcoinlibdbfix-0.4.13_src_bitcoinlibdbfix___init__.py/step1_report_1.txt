  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no immediately evident malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads data from standard input, files, or environment variables; no suspicious external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, files, or network sockets; no suspicious or insecure sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or storage points; no abnormal or suspicious source-to-sink paths detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. No obfuscated code, malicious API calls, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses typical Python constructs with clear structure. No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious imports. No unusual data handling patterns or security vulnerabilities apparent. The absence of external network connections or data exfiltration points supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and safe. Confidence in this conclusion is high.",
