  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code details, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a wallet management utility built on bitcoinlib, performing standard operations: create/list wallets, generate keys, import transactions, send transactions.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- Sensitive data (passphrases, keys) are printed directly, which is insecure but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or malicious logic detected.\n- The code relies on well-established libraries and straightforward logic.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & sources/sinks/flows:** Correctly describes the code's functions.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes insecure printing of sensitive info, no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Valid; no malware, just insecure info handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk is low but acknowledged due to insecure info handling.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard behavior, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No suspicious activity, and scoring aligns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Similar findings: standard wallet functions, no malicious code, just insecure info display.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. The scoring is consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Reiterates standard behavior, no suspicious network activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Focuses on the exposure of passphrases and keys via print statements, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The risk score is justified given the insecure handling, but no malware.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the described functionality.\n- **Malware presence:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All reports assign 0.2 for security risk, which is reasonable given the insecure info display but not malicious.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high, given the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Security risk score:** **0.2** (due to insecure printing of sensitive info, which is a security concern but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code appears legitimate, with the main security concern being the insecure handling of sensitive data via print statements, which should be replaced with secure logging or storage practices.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No malware or obfuscation concerns. The security risk score remains low but should be acknowledged in security reviews.",
