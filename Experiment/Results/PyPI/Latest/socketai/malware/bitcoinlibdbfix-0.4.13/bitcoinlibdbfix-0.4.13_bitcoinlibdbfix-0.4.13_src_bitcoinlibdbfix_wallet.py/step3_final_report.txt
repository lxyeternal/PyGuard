  "purpose": "Manage Bitcoin wallets, generate keys, import transactions, and send transactions using bitcoinlib.",
  "sources": "User arguments for wallet name, network, passphrase, database; JSON files for transaction import; external libraries for wallet and key operations.",
  "sinks": "Print statements exposing passphrases, keys, transaction hashes, and statuses.",
  "flows": "Input args and files provide data to wallet methods; sensitive data is printed directly; transaction data flows from JSON to wallet import; transaction hashes and statuses are printed.",
  "anomalies": "Sensitive information such as passphrases, WIFs, and public keys are printed to stdout, which is insecure but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet management functions with straightforward logic. It uses the bitcoinlib library for wallet and key operations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The main security concern is the insecure printing of sensitive data, which could lead to information leaks if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties. No signs of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and the security implications of exposing secrets via print statements. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.8-0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and performs expected wallet management functions without malicious intent. The primary security issue is the insecure handling of sensitive data through print statements, which should be replaced with secure logging practices. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is low but warrants best practices for secret handling.",
