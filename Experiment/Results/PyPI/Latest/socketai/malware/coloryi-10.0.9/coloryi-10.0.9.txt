The minor package name inconsistency should be corrected for proper packaging but does not impact security. All reports are accurate; the malware and obfuscation scores should be 0, and the security risk score should be 0."

      "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for covert exfiltration of Telegram user data, employing obfuscation, stealth, and persistence techniques. It exfiltrates sensitive data without user consent, making it a high-severity threat with high malware and security risk scores. The obfuscation level is moderate to high, justified by variable naming and code complexity."
