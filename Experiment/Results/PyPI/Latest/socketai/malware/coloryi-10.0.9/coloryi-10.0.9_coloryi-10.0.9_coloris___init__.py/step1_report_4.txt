{
  "purpose": "The script appears to gather Telegram data files from a user's device, compress them into a ZIP archive, and upload the archive to a Telegram bot API endpoint, likely for exfiltration of user data.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (USERNAME), filesystem paths (via os.path, Path), standard input/output, system calls, and file operations for reading files and checking existence.",
  "sinks": "Requests library POST request to Telegram API endpoint with the ZIP file, filesystem operations like file removal, process creation for background tasks, and potential deletion of temporary files.",
  "flows": "Extraction of user data directory path -> collection of files -> compression into ZIP -> upload via requests.post -> cleanup of files and processes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, copying user data without explicit user consent, background process spawning with no clear purpose, obfuscated variable names, and inclusion of a self-deletion script that terminates itself after a delay. The code does not contain user prompts or safeguards, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code initiates by collecting user-specific Telegram data directories and creates a ZIP archive of certain cache and media folders. It then uploads this archive to a predefined Telegram bot API endpoint, with hardcoded credentials, likely to exfiltrate data. There are background thread processes that monitor and delete temporary scripts, which seem designed to hide activity or maintain persistence. The use of obfuscated variable names and dynamic code snippets further suggests malicious intent. The script does not appear to be part of legitimate functionality; instead, it is crafted to covertly collect and transmit user data.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and exhibits malicious behavior aimed at data exfiltration from a user’s system via Telegram. It gathers user data without consent, compresses and uploads it, and then attempts to delete its temporary files. The presence of hardcoded credentials and the obfuscated nature of some parts strongly indicate malicious intent.",
