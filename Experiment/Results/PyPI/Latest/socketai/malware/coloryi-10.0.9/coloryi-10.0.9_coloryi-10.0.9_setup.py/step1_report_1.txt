{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'coloryi' Python package, primarily for color formatting utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies ('requests'), package metadata (name, version, author, URL, etc.), and requirements via the setup() function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; however, the 'requests' dependency could potentially be used for network activity if invoked elsewhere, but is not used directly in this script.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration defines the package metadata and dependencies but does not execute any untrusted data flows or network operations within this script itself.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It specifies only package info and a dependency on 'requests' but does not contain any runtime code or network activity. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The 'requests' library could be used in the package itself but is not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python utility library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a normal, benign package configuration.",
