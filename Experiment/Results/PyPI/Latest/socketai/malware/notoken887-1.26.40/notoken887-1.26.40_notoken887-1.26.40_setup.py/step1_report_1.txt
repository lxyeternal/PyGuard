  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'notoken887' including metadata and entry point configuration.",
  "sources": "User inputs via setup() parameters and package discovery through find_packages()",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'notoken887.main:main' via console script entry point",
  "flows": "No external data flows or untrusted input sources; setup parameters are static",
  "anomalies": "Author email is 'hitler@gmail.com' which may indicate malicious intent or be intentionally provocative; package description and URL seem suspicious or placeholder-like; no actual obfuscated or malicious code included in the script",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points. No code execution or data handling occurs beyond package setup. The author email and URL are suspicious but do not constitute malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external data flows are present. The only noteworthy anomaly is the provocative email address and URL, which could be malicious or unprofessional, but not technically malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no direct malicious behavior or malware. The only concerns are the suspicious contact details and URL, which could be used for malicious purposes outside of this code context. Overall, the script itself is benign.",
