  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports describe a single import statement: `import utils`.\n   - There is no indication of any other code, data flows, or sinks.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and standard; no suspicious or malicious code is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in stating that a single import statement is benign in isolation.\n   - They correctly note the lack of context, data flows, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Most reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0 or very low (0.1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence scores vary but are generally reasonable given the limited context.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across all, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - Given the code's simplicity, higher scores would be unjustified unless additional context indicated malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n   - Since the code is just an import statement, this is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the lack of context.\n   - They correctly state that the import alone does not imply malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: low risk, no malware, minimal obfuscation.\n   - Slight variations in confidence are acceptable given the limited information.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- The reports are accurate and cautious.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, due to minimal code, but acknowledging that further code could change this)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven only this import statement, the code is safe, and the risk is negligible. The reports correctly reflect this. No further action or suspicion is warranted based solely on this snippet.",
