{
  "purpose": "Import a module named utils, likely for utility functions or operations.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import utils' reads the utils module, which could contain data or functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flow is evident from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the presence of a simple import statement does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a module named utils. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to determine if this import is malicious. The utils module could be benign or malicious depending on its contents, which are not provided here. The code itself is straightforward and does not exhibit obfuscation, suspicious behavior, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The import appears standard. However, without inspecting the utils module, a complete assessment cannot be made.",
