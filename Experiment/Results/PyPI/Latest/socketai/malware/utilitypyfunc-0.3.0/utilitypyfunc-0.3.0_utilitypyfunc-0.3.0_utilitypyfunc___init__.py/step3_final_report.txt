{
  "purpose": "To assess the supply chain security risk of a Python package that only imports the 'utils' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import utils'. No other data or code is provided.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows or potential data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable from the snippet; the import is static and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the minimal code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement, which is a common and benign practice. Without access to the 'utils' module's content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or very low) are appropriate given the limited context. The reports correctly acknowledge the lack of further information and avoid unwarranted assumptions. The overall assessment indicates no immediate security concern based solely on this import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no detectable malicious activity or security risks. The scores are consistent with the evidence. Further review of the 'utils' module would be necessary to confirm safety, but based solely on this snippet, the package appears safe.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
