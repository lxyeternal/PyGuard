  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected. The code is a simple import statement.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no issues.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The confidence score is 0.3, which seems low given the benign nature of an import statement.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.  \n- **Recommendation:** Increase confidence slightly to reflect the low suspicion, but overall, the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** Confidence is 0.2, which is very low; perhaps it should be slightly higher but still reflects minimal suspicion.  \n- **Scores:** All zeros except securityRisk=0.1, which is acceptable.  \n- **Recommendation:** The scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The securityRisk score is 0.1, which is appropriate given the minimal code.  \n- **Scores:** All consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Recommendation:** The confidence score of 0.8 is high, which might be slightly overstated for just an import statement, but given the cautious approach, it's acceptable.\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** Confidence score of 0.3 seems reasonable.  \n- **Scores:** All appropriate.  \n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code snippets.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.  \n- **Risk scores:** All are low (0 or 0.1), appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n### Final notes:\n- Since all reports are based solely on a simple import statement, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.\n- The scores are generally reasonable; only the confidence levels could be slightly adjusted upward in some cases, but they are not unreasonable.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk due to lack of context, but generally safe)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate given the limited code snippets. No significant concerns or adjustments are necessary.",
