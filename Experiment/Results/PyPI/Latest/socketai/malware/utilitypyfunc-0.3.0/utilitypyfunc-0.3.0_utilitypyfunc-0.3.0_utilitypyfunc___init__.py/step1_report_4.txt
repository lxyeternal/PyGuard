  "purpose": "The code imports the 'utils' module, likely to utilize helper functions or utilities, but the specific purpose cannot be determined without further code context.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a source, indicating the module being loaded. No other input or data reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there are no data outputs, network connections, or system modifications shown.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths because the code only contains an import statement with no further logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a single import statement, which is standard and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is minimal, consisting only of an import statement. Without additional code, no malicious activity or security risks can be identified. The module 'utils' may contain further code, but based solely on this snippet, there are no indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent or security issues. There are no suspicious behaviors, and the code appears benign in its current form.",
