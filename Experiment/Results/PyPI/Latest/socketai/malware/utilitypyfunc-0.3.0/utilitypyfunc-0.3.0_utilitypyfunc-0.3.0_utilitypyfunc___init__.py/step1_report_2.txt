  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'utils', likely for utility functions, but the purpose cannot be determined solely from this line.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'utils' module; no other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow can be assessed from a lone import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and lacks context; the import is standard, but without further code, suspicious behavior cannot be ruled out.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement for 'utils'. There are no functions, data inputs, or outputs shown. Without additional code, it is impossible to analyze for malicious behavior or security issues. The import itself is a common practice and not inherently suspicious. No anomalies or malicious activity can be inferred from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard import with no suspicious characteristics identified.",
