  "flows": "No data flows are observable beyond the module import, which is standard practice.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present in this single import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for the 'utils' module. No input reading, data processing, or suspicious activity is apparent. Without further code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The import itself is common and benign in a typical codebase.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the single import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and standard.",
