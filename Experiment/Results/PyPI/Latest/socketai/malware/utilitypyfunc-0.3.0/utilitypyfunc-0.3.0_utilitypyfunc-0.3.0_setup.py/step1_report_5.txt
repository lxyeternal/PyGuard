  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'utilitypyfunc'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'install_requires' list, the 'name', 'version', 'author', 'author_email', and 'description' fields.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that handle untrusted data, but it specifies dependencies and package metadata.",
  "flows": "The setup function processes package metadata and dependencies, with no untrusted data flow or external data handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The metadata appears standard. The email provided is publicly available and may be a personal contact but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "This is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python modules. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata including name, version, author, description, classifiers, and dependencies. The dependencies include 'requests', a common library, and the author’s email is provided. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The script's purpose is solely to configure package installation parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely for packaging the 'utilitypyfunc' library. No security issues or malware are present.",
