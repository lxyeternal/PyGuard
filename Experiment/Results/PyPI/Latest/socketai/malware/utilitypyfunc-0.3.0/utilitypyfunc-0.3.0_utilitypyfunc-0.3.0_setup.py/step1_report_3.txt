  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'utilitypyfunc' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "N/A (configuration script, no input sources)",
  "sinks": "N/A (configuration script, no data sinks or untrusted data handling)",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow, just package setup configuration)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward use of setuptools for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies the package name, version, packages to include, required dependencies, author info, description, classifiers, and Python version requirement. No code execution, input reading, or network operations occur. The install_requires list includes only the 'requests' library, which is a common dependency. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
