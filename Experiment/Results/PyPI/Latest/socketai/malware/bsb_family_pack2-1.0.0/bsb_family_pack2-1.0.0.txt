This presents a security vulnerability but not malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, warranting a score around 0.6, while malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0."

      "conclusion": "The code is a privacy-invasive monitoring tool that exfiltrates sensitive data via Telegram. While it does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads, its behavior aligns with spyware or surveillance malware. The high malware scores in some reports are justified given its exfiltration capabilities. Overall, it poses a significant privacy risk and potential for misuse, warranting a high security risk score, but it is not inherently malicious code with payloads."
