  "flows": "No data flow paths identified; this appears to be an empty __init__.py file.",
  "anomalies": "The file contains no code, logic, or potentially suspicious constructs; absence of code suggests no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This is an empty __init__.py file, which typically serves to mark a directory as a package. No code, data handling, or logic present to analyze for security issues or malware. As such, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to evaluate. The lack of code reduces the likelihood of malicious activity or obfuscation within this specific file.",
  "conclusion": "This file is an empty package initializer with no executable code. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It serves a structural purpose in Python packaging.",
