  "purpose": "CLI tool managing Telegram bot connection and monitoring, accepting user commands and sensitive parameters.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for --token and --chat_id, user input via argparse.",
  "sinks": "External functions (`connect_family`, `disconnect_family`, `start_monitoring`) which may handle sensitive data or perform network actions.",
  "flows": "User inputs token and chat_id -> arguments parsed -> `connect_family` called with token and chat_id, or other functions invoked based on flags.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward argument parsing and function calls. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface that processes user commands to connect/disconnect or monitor. It passes sensitive data via arguments, which is typical but requires secure handling in external functions. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. External functions' security depends on their implementation, but within this snippet, no issues are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI wrapper with no malicious or high-risk elements. Security concerns are minimal and depend on external function implementations. The assigned scores accurately reflect the code's safety profile.",
