  "purpose": "CLI tool for connecting/disconnecting to a Telegram family bot and starting monitoring.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (--token, --chat_id, -connect, -disconnect, -monitor).",
  "sinks": "connect_family() function potentially uses token and chat_id, which may be sensitive data; start_monitoring() might initiate background processes.",
  "flows": "User provides token and chat_id, which flow into connect_family(); other options trigger disconnect_family() or start_monitoring().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code or backdoors, no obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles user input via command-line arguments, then calls external functions from imported modules. It properly requires necessary parameters for connection. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration code present within this snippet. The functions called (connect_family, disconnect_family, start_monitoring) are external; their implementations could contain risks, but based solely on this code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard command-line interface for managing a Telegram bot and monitoring; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. Potential security concerns depend on the implementations of the imported functions, but within this snippet, nothing suspicious is detected.",
