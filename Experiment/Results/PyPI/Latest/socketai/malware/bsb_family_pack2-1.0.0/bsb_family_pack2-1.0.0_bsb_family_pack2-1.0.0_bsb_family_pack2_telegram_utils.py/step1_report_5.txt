  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to send messages and documents via Telegram Bot API",
  "sources": "tg_token (function parameter), tg_chat_id (function parameter), message (function parameter), file_path (function parameter)",
  "sinks": "requests.post calls to Telegram API endpoints, potentially sending untrusted data to external servers",
  "flows": "Input parameters (tg_token, tg_chat_id, message, file_path) flow into request data, which is sent to Telegram API via POST requests",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behaviors evident",
  "analysis": "The code provides two straightforward functions to send messages and documents using the Telegram Bot API. It uses input parameters for tokens, chat IDs, messages, and file paths, which are standard. The requests are sent directly to the Telegram API endpoints. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. Error handling is minimal and only prints errors. The functions appear benign and intended for communication purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for sending messages and documents via Telegram. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided implementation.",
