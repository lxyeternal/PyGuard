  "purpose": "Utility functions to send messages and documents via Telegram Bot API.",
  "sources": "Parameters tg_token, tg_chat_id, message, and file_path; URL construction; file reading from disk.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Telegram API endpoints; potential data leakage if tokens are maliciously used.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> requests.post() -> response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious URL patterns; minimal error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, providing messaging utilities without malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The functions perform standard API calls with parameters supplied at runtime. Error handling is minimal but acceptable for utility functions. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The risk is primarily if parameters are malicious, but this is inherent to such utility functions and not a code flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of Telegram messaging utilities with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.",
