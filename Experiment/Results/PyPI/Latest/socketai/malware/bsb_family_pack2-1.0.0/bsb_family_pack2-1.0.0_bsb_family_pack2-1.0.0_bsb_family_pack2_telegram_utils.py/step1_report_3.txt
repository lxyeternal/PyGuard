  "purpose": "To send messages and documents via Telegram bot API.",
  "sources": "tg_token (input parameter), tg_chat_id (input parameter), message (input parameter), file_path (input parameter)",
  "sinks": "requests.post() calls to Telegram API endpoints, reading files from file_path",
  "flows": "Input parameters (tg_token, tg_chat_id, message, file_path) are used to construct HTTP requests to Telegram API endpoints for sending messages or documents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious URL patterns beyond legitimate Telegram API usage, no obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to send messages and files through Telegram, using input parameters for tokens, chat IDs, message content, and file paths. It employs standard HTTP POST requests via the 'requests' library and handles exceptions with print statements. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized data collection. The code appears straightforward, performing legitimate API calls for messaging purposes. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a utility for sending messages and files via Telegram. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be a benign, well-structured implementation.",
