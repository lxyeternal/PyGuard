  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to send messages and documents via Telegram bot API.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: tg_token, tg_chat_id, message, and file_path.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoints, potentially exposing data if parameters are maliciously set.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> requests.post calls -> potential response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code. The code does not perform any malicious actions itself.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for interacting with Telegram API: send_message and send_document. It constructs URLs using provided tokens and chat IDs, then posts data or files. No hardcoded secrets are present; credentials are passed as parameters. Error handling is simple printing. No suspicious data leaks, no system modifications, no network exfiltration, and no obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and intended for messaging purposes only. There is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for sending messages and documents via Telegram. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It operates within expected bounds for such functionality.",
