  "purpose": "Manage Telegram family connection configurations by saving credentials and sending notifications on connect/disconnect.",
  "sources": "Input data: tg_token and tg_chat_id provided to connect_family; reading config file in disconnect_family.",
  "sinks": "send_message function potentially transmits sensitive credentials over the network; writing credentials to a local JSON file.",
  "flows": "connect_family: takes tg_token and tg_chat_id, stores in file, sends message. disconnect_family: reads credentials, sends message, deletes file.",
  "anomalies": "Storing sensitive tokens in plaintext on disk; sending messages containing potentially sensitive info without encryption; no validation or obfuscation of credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code stores Telegram tokens and chat IDs in a plaintext JSON file, which can be accessed or modified by other processes. The send_message function is called with sensitive tokens, potentially transmitting credentials over the network. The code lacks encryption or secure handling for credentials, which poses security risks. There are no obvious malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or backdoors, but the handling of credentials is insecure and could be exploited if the environment is compromised. Overall, the code’s behavior indicates a potential security concern rather than malicious intent, primarily due to insecure credential storage and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not explicitly malicious but demonstrates insecure handling of sensitive data (plaintext storage and transmission). It could be exploited if compromised, but does not appear to contain malicious actions or backdoors.",
