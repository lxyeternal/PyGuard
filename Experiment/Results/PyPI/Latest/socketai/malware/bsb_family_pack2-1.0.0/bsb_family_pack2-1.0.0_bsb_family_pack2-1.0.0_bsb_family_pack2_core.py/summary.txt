  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but insecurely handles sensitive credentials by storing them in plaintext and transmitting them directly. This presents a security vulnerability but not malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, warranting a score around 0.6, while malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0."
