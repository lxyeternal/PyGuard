  "purpose": "Manage Telegram connection configuration for a family member, including connecting and disconnecting by storing credentials and sending notifications.",
  "sources": "tg_token and tg_chat_id inputs to connect_family; reading CONFIG_FILE during disconnect_family.",
  "sinks": "send_message function which uses tg_token and tg_chat_id to send messages; reading and deleting CONFIG_FILE.",
  "flows": "connect_family writes credentials to CONFIG_FILE, then send_message is called; disconnect_family reads credentials from CONFIG_FILE, calls send_message, then deletes CONFIG_FILE.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of a JSON file to store sensitive tokens; no validation or encryption of credentials; direct use of tokens in send_message. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to store Telegram bot token and chat ID in a local JSON file and send notifications upon connection and disconnection. It reads and writes sensitive data but does not appear to misuse or exfiltrate data. The send_message function uses the stored tokens directly, which is standard for such integrations but could pose security risks if accessed maliciously. The removal of config file during disconnect mitigates persistent storage risk but does not encrypt or obfuscate secrets. Overall, the logic is straightforward with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code manages Telegram credentials for notifications with standard methods; no malicious behavior detected. However, storing sensitive tokens in plaintext poses security concerns if the environment is compromised. No indicators of malware or sabotage are present.",
