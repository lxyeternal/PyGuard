  "purpose": "Manage family connection status by storing Telegram credentials and sending notifications upon connect/disconnect events.",
  "sources": "tg_token and tg_chat_id parameters in connect_family; reading CONFIG_FILE in disconnect_family.",
  "sinks": "send_message function potentially transmitting sensitive credentials over network.",
  "flows": "connect_family: input parameters -> save credentials to file -> send notification; disconnect_family: read credentials from file -> send notification -> delete file.",
  "anomalies": "Storing Telegram token and chat ID in plaintext JSON file; no encryption or secure storage; sending messages with credentials without validation; no input validation or access controls implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code stores Telegram credentials directly in a JSON file without encryption, which poses a security risk if the file is accessed by unauthorized parties. The send_message function is invoked with sensitive data, potentially transmitting secrets. The connect_family function overwrites the config file each time, and disconnect_family reads and deletes it, which could lead to issues if multiple processes access the file simultaneously. The code does not validate input parameters or restrict access, increasing risk of misuse. Overall, the logic is straightforward, but the handling of sensitive data and lack of security measures are concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits no signs of malicious intent but contains security vulnerabilities due to plaintext storage of sensitive credentials and their transmission via send_message. These practices could lead to credential leakage if the environment is compromised. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
