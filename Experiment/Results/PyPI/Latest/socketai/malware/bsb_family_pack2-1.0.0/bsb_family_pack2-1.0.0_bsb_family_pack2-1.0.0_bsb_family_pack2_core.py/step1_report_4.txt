  "purpose": "Manage Telegram connection configurations by saving and removing credentials, and send notification messages upon connection or disconnection.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters (tg_token, tg_chat_id), reading from CONFIG_FILE during disconnect.",
  "sinks": "Sending messages via send_message function with tg_token and tg_chat_id, writing to CONFIG_FILE.",
  "flows": "connect_family writes credentials to CONFIG_FILE and triggers send_message; disconnect_family reads credentials from CONFIG_FILE, triggers send_message, and deletes CONFIG_FILE.",
  "anomalies": "Sensitive credentials (tg_token, tg_chat_id) are stored in plaintext in CONFIG_FILE without encryption; the code directly writes and reads these credentials; no validation or protection mechanisms are in place.",
  "analysis": "The code handles sensitive information by storing Telegram tokens and chat IDs in plaintext, which poses security risks if the file is accessed maliciously. The send_message function is called with these credentials, which could be exploited if send_message or the credentials are compromised. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are present. The overall behavior appears to be straightforward configuration management with notifications, but handling of secrets is insecure. No malicious behavior or malware is detected based on this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious intent or malware. However, it insecurely manages sensitive credentials by storing them unencrypted, which is a security concern. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary risk is the plaintext storage of secrets, which could lead to credential theft if the CONFIG_FILE is accessed by malicious actors.",
