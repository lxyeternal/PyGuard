  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes code upon installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method of the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class which calls 'main()' from 'main' module after installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' from 'main' module executed during installation, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the 'run' method is called, which then imports and executes 'main()' from 'main'.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes an external function 'main()' unconditionally during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package with standard fields and dependencies. The key point is the custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method to invoke 'main()' from the 'main' module. This behavior causes arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is atypical and risky. No other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is present. The intentional execution of 'main()' at install time raises security concerns, especially if 'main()' performs malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a potentially malicious behavior by executing 'main()' during installation, which could run arbitrary or malicious code. This design is suspicious and warrants caution, as it could be used to execute harmful actions upon package installation.",
