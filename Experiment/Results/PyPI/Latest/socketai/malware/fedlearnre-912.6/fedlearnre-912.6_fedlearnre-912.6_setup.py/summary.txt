  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation introduces a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' contains malicious code. While the code itself appears benign, this unconventional behavior is suspicious and potentially exploitable. The scores should reflect a high potential for malicious activity and security risk, with malware around 0.7 and overall risk approximately 0.8. Caution is advised, and further review of 'main()' is recommended."
