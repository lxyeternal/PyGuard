  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - reading system hostname, username, and current directory.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sending constructed URL with system info to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) and a random number are used as URL parameters sent via HTTP GET requests to remote URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs, including suspicious domains, and sending system info without user consent. No explicit user input, but data is being exfiltrated to external servers.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, username, and current working directory, along with a random number, then constructs URLs to three different external domains. It performs HTTP GET requests to these URLs, appending system info as query parameters. The domains appear suspicious and could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not handle any response beyond logging and does not restrict execution. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, but the act of sending environment info to unknown servers is concerning and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform data exfiltration of system information to potentially malicious domains, which could be used for tracking or malicious surveillance. There is no immediate indication of malicious payload execution, but the exfiltration activity is suspicious and potentially malicious in context.",
