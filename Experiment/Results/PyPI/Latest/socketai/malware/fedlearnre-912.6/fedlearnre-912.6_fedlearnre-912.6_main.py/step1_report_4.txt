  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs with a random identifier, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) (sending data to external servers)",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, username, current_path) -> parameters (package, hostname, username, dir) -> full_url -> urlopen request to remote URLs",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious URLs with non-descriptive domains, dynamic URL generation with a random number, no validation or sanitization, potential for data exfiltration, and reliance on external servers. The URLs are obscure and possibly malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identifiers such as hostname, username, and current working directory. It generates a random number to append as an identifier. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends this information via HTTP GET requests. The code does not validate or restrict the URLs, and the external domains seem obscure, indicating potential malicious intent for data collection or tracking. The code uses standard libraries but employs them in a way consistent with malicious or tracking behavior. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious backdoors is present in the code structure itself, but the intent to exfiltrate system info is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for unauthorized data collection or tracking, evidenced by its contact with suspicious URLs and collection of system info without user consent. While technically simple, its purpose aligns with malicious or privacy-invasive activity.",
