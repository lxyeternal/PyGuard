{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple external URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and generates a random number with random.randint().",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system info as query parameters using urllib.request.urlopen().",
  "flows": "System info and random number (source) flow into URL request parameters, which are sent over the network (sink) to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, including one with '.fun' TLD. Data is being exfiltrated without user consent. No user input validation or user notification. No apparent legitimate purpose for this data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP requests to external domains. The URLs appear suspicious and may be used for tracking or exfiltration. Exception handling only logs errors; no fallback or security checks. No authentication or encryption mechanisms are present. Overall, the code exhibits behavior consistent with clandestine data collection or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects sensitive system info and transmits it to external, potentially malicious domains without user consent. It is highly suspicious and likely intended for malicious data exfiltration or tracking. No benign purpose is evident.",
