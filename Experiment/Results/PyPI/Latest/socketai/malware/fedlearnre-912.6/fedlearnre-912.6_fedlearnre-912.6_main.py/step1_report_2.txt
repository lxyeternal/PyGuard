  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple external URLs, likely for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url)",
  "flows": "Gather system info -> construct URL with parameters -> send GET request to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple external URLs with obfuscated-like domain names, sending potentially sensitive system info without user consent, no clear legitimate purpose",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory. It generates a random number to create unique request URLs, which include these details as query parameters. The URLs point to suspicious domains that resemble known malicious or test domains. The code attempts to open these URLs, reading and logging the responses. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity. The code does not perform any input validation, encryption, or user notification. No benign purpose is evident, and the code's actions are consistent with malicious data collection, especially given the obfuscated and suspicious domain names.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors consistent with data exfiltration or reconnaissance, possibly malicious. It contacts external servers with system info without user consent or clear purpose. The suspicious domains and pattern of data collection raise security concerns. Overall, the code likely has malicious intent or at least highly suspicious behavior.",
