  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution of the 'envvenuma' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Open() function reading 'README.md' for long description",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content for description; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a file for long description is typical; no anomalies or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. The only external data read is the README.md file for the long description, which is typical and harmless. No dynamic code execution, credential handling, or network operations are present within this script. The code does not include or execute any potentially malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It only reads a Markdown file for documentation purposes and defines package metadata.",
