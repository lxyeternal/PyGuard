  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'envvenuma', intended to facilitate installation and dependency management.",
  "sources": "N/A (no runtime data input, only static setup configuration).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data handling or data leaks within this script).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from source to sink; this is a static setup script).",
  "anomalies": "The description indicates the package may get and send environment variables, but no such operations are performed in this setup script itself. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata and dependencies but does not contain any logic that handles environment variables, network communication, or data processing. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues within this static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and contains no malicious or suspicious code. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies without performing any runtime operations that could be harmful.",
