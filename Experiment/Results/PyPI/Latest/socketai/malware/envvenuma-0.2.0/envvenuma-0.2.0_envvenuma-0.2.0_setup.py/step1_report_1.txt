{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'envvenuma', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is typical. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or external data handling beyond static package setup. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code is evident. The dependencies are straightforward, with 'requests' as a common HTTP library, and no signs of malicious payloads or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without any malicious logic.",
