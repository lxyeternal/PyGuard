  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'envvenuma' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content as long description; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' for long description is standard; no suspicious or unusual code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. No input validation issues, no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data beyond reading a static README file, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and benign. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
