  "purpose": "Maintain backwards compatibility by manipulating sys.modules to ensure specific package identities are preserved across the codebase.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'sys', 'compat', and dynamically imported modules such as 'urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet' via __import__.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to sys.modules to alias modules under 'requests.packages.*'.",
  "flows": "Imports of packages -> sys.modules modifications to preserve package identities -> aliasing modules under 'requests.packages.*'.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic manipulation of sys.modules to alias modules; potential for masking or overriding modules at runtime, which can be suspicious if used maliciously, but in this context appears for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages ('urllib3', 'idna') and manipulates sys.modules to alias these packages under 'requests.packages.*', ensuring their identities are preserved for compatibility. It also conditionally does the same for 'chardet' if present, renaming it to 'requests.packages.chardet'. This is a common pattern to maintain backward compatibility with older versions of the 'requests' library that bundled these packages internally. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present. The module aliasing could potentially obscure the origin of modules, but given the context, it seems intended for compatibility rather than malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for backwards compatibility, manipulating sys.modules to alias imported packages under a specific namespace. There are no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The module aliasing is unusual but justified within a compatibility context. No security risks are identified in this code.",
