  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') under the 'requests.packages' namespace to ensure legacy code functions correctly.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' modules; reading these modules' attributes.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to sys.modules entries for module aliasing; no data leaks or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules entries under 'requests.packages', establishing aliases for legacy compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic manipulation of sys.modules for module aliasing; no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific third-party modules and reassigns their references within sys.modules to maintain compatibility with older codebases expecting modules under 'requests.packages'. This pattern is a known workaround for vendoring or legacy support. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The manipulation is straightforward and well-understood, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are appropriate given the benign purpose but acknowledge the potential misuse if environment is compromised. Overall, the code is a benign compatibility shim with minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard backward compatibility mechanism that manipulates sys.modules to alias third-party modules. It does not perform any malicious activity or pose a security threat. The assigned scores are justified, and the code is safe for use in its intended context.",
