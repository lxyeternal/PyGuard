  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and libraries, mainly for compatibility across Python 2 and 3, and for handling HTTP-related operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib), and dynamic import of optional libraries (chardet, simplejson).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe import of 'simplejson' if overridden, but not inherently dangerous. No direct sinks for untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Importing optional libraries like 'chardet' and 'simplejson' could introduce untrusted modules, but this is a standard pattern for fallback mechanisms and does not involve untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code performs standard compatibility and utility functions with normal import patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles imports and version detection for Python 2/3 compatibility, as well as optional detection of 'chardet' and 'simplejson'. It performs dynamic imports with standard try-except blocks, and assigns compatibility variables accordingly. No external data sources, user input, or untrusted data sources are processed. The import patterns are standard for compatibility layers. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present. Overall, this appears to be boilerplate compatibility code, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility and utility setup code with no malicious behavior detected. It does not contain security risks, malware, or obfuscated code, and is safe for use.",
