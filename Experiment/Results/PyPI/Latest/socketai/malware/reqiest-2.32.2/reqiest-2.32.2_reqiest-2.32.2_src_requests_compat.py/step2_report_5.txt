  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report to verify the presence of issues, assess their reasoning, and ensure the scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily a compatibility layer handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- It uses standard Python idioms: try-except for optional imports, version checks, and compatibility variables.\n- No data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is evident.\n- No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is boilerplate, typical for compatibility modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes standard compatibility and import handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows or dangerous sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; code is safe, standard, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing compatibility and environment detection.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on version detection, optional libraries, and utility functions.\n- No untrusted data or malicious behavior.\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Highlights standard imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid. No adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Summarizes the code as compatibility utilities, with no data sinks or malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation or malware.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the code's benign nature.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n- Import patterns are standard and safe.\n- No external data or user input is processed.\n- The dynamic import attempts are standard fallback mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Scores:** Based on the code review, I concur with the assigned scores:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n- **Potential for Higher Scores:** Only if malicious or obfuscated code were present, which it isn't here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The code is a typical compatibility module with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and standard practices observed.",
