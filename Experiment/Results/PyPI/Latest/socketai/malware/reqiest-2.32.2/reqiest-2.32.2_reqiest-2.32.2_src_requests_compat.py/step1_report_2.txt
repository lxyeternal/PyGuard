{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for HTTP requests, character detection, and Python version handling.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, sys.version_info, urllib3.__version__, and various standard library imports for URL handling and JSON parsing.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involving untrusted data; import statements and version checks are safe.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from source to sink; the code primarily imports modules and sets up compatibility variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, mainly compatibility and environment detection logic; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, version compatibility checks, and module imports for JSON, URL handling, and character detection libraries. It uses try-except blocks to handle optional dependencies and defines compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3. All operations are standard and do not involve data manipulation or external inputs that could be malicious. No obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility module for a larger project, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It mainly sets up environment and library detection, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
