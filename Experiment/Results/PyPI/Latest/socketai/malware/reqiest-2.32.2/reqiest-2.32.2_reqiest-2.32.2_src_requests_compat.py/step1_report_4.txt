{
  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for handling HTTP requests, character encoding detection, and Python version differences, primarily for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, collections, http, io, urllib), dynamic module imports (simplejson, chardet), and attribute access (urllib3 version).",
  "sinks": "No sensitive sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present. Import statements and attribute assignments do not constitute data sinks with security implications.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks. The flow is mainly static import and version detection logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns. The code relies solely on standard library modules and straightforward logic for backward compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection, optional imports, and compatibility assignments using standard libraries. It includes dynamic import attempts for 'simplejson' and 'chardet' without handling any user input or untrusted data. There are no network operations, command executions, or data leak vectors. The code is consistent with typical compatibility modules, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard compatibility utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages imports, version checks, and compatibility shims. No sensitive data handling or security-critical operations are present.",
