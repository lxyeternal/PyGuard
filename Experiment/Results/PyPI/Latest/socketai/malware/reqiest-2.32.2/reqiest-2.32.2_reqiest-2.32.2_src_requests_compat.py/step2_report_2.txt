  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the validity of their conclusions and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard compatibility and utility module, primarily handling imports, version detection, and optional library detection.\n- No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data, no network or file operations that could be malicious.\n- All import patterns are typical for such compatibility layers.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility code, dynamic imports of 'chardet' and 'simplejson', no malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is boilerplate, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on compatibility, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility setup, version detection, optional library imports, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose and content.\n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility and utility functions, standard import and version detection, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility, import handling, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n- **Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or payloads)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or code hiding)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks, no untrusted data handling)\n\nThe code is boilerplate compatibility code, typical in many open source projects, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scoring is justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
