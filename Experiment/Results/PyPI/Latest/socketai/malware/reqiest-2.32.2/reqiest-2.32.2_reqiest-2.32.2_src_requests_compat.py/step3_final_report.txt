  "purpose": "Compatibility layer handling Python 2/3 differences, optional dependencies ('chardet', 'simplejson'), and URL/HTTP utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version detection, optional module imports, version info variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data processing",
  "flows": "Import and version detection flows, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard import patterns, no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard compatibility and utility module, performing version checks, optional library imports, and defining compatibility variables. It contains no dynamic code execution, data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All import patterns are typical, with try-except blocks for optional dependencies. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility boilerplate with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The initial reports' assessments are accurate, and their scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
