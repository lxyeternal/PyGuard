{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling Python 2 and 3 differences, HTTP-related utilities, and character detection libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from urllib3, attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', imports standard libraries like 'sys', 'importlib', 'json', 'collections', 'http', 'io', and 'urllib'.",
  "sinks": "Uses imported modules for character detection, JSON parsing, URL parsing, and HTTP proxy handling; no direct sink points for untrusted data are apparent.",
  "flows": "No direct flow from external untrusted input to critical sink functions. The code primarily sets up compatibility and utility functions without processing external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code strictly handles imports, version detection, and compatibility wrappers without any hidden or obfuscated behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility module handling Python version differences, library imports, and URL/HTTP utilities. It performs version checks, attempts to import optional libraries (like simplejson and chardet), and defines some utility functions for character detection and URL parsing. No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data, and no suspicious logic are present. The import patterns and function definitions are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility layer with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It strictly performs standard library imports, version checks, and optional library imports for utility purposes. There are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
