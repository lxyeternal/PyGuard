{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for handling different Python versions and dependencies, especially for HTTP and character detection.",
  "sources": "importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs, as code primarily imports modules and defines variables",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly initializes variables and imports modules",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected; code is standard for compatibility purposes",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports, version detection, and module resolution for character encoding libraries and JSON handling. It checks for urllib3 version and attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' for character detection. It also sets compatibility flags for Python 2 and 3, imports JSON modules, and defines some type aliases. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the structure is typical for compatibility modules. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module for Python, handling imports and version detection without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior.",
