  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author information, license, and other related information.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded metadata variables at the beginning of the module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or output sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets static metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior detected; the code is standard package metadata definition.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments containing package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author details, and license information. There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard and benign, typical for Python package setup or metadata modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata declaration for the 'requests' library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
