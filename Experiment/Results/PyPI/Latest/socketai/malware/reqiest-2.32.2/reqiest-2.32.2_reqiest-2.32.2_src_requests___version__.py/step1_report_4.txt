  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings and constants defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as suspicious code, obfuscated content, or hidden behaviors are present. The ASCII art at the top is purely decorative and does not influence code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata. No input handling, external data processing, or execution logic is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code. The ASCII art at the beginning is decorative and does not impact functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and merely sets package metadata. There is no malicious intent or security risk present.",
