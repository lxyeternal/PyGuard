  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading operations present).",
  "sinks": "None (no data outputs or untrusted data handling observed).",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of metadata variable assignments; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns string and integer values to variables that describe the package's metadata. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak information, and no control flow or logic. The presence of an ASCII art header is purely decorative. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata definition for the 'requests' package, with no malicious intent, anomalies, or security concerns detected.",
