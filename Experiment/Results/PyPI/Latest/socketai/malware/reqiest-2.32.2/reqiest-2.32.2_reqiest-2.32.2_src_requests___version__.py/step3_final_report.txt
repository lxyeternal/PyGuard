  "purpose": "Static metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python package, including package info and decorative ASCII art.",
  "sources": "None; static variable assignments defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or dynamic execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Decorative ASCII art header, but no functional anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no input/output, data processing, or dynamic code. The ASCII art is purely decorative. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. The confidence level is high (1), given the static and straightforward content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign metadata for the 'requests' package, with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
