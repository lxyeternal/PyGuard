  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code solely defines exception classes for the Requests library. It notes the absence of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the nature of the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes the straightforward nature of class definitions without external data handling or malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent, and the scores are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report again confirms the code is standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** The evaluation aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** It highlights the absence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation, noting only standard exception class definitions.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Conclusion:** The assessment and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of exception class definitions used for error handling in an HTTP request library.\n- **Malware Score:** All are zero, which is appropriate. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero, as the code is straightforward and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Zero, since there's no security risk or vulnerability present.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the code's nature, the scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis. The code is standard, well-structured, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed assessments provided.",
