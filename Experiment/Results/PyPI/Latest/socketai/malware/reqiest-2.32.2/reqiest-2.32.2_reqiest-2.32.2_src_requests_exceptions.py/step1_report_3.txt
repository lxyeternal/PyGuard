{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for handling various errors in the Requests library, such as connection issues, HTTP errors, JSON decoding errors, and warnings related to the library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class instantiations and attribute checks within exception constructors, particularly in __init__ methods, and the import statements from external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the construction of exceptions with arbitrary arguments and attribute access that could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but there are no explicit sinks for untrusted data or network operations within this code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves creating exception instances based on error conditions, primarily within constructors, with no external input or network data processing shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code behavior, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for the Requests library, including specialized error types and warnings. Exception constructors use standard Python patterns, with no evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Imports are from standard or related modules, and no untrusted input handling or network activity is present. The structure is typical of a well-organized exception module, with no anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard exception and warning class definition module for the Requests library. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code is safe, with a very low malware and security risk score.",
