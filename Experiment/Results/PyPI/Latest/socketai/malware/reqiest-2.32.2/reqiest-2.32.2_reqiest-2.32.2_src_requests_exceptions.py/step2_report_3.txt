  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes for Requests.\n- Sources: Imports from urllib3 and compat module; no external data.\n- Sinks: No data sinks; only exception class definitions.\n- Flows: No complex data flows; exception raising is standard.\n- Anomalies: No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Straightforward class definitions, inheritance, comments, no external or internal data manipulation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard exception module.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining exceptions.\n- Sources: No external data reading.\n- Sinks: No unsafe data handling.\n- Flows: Exception instantiation based on errors.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies or suspicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard class definitions, no dynamic code or network activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines exceptions and warnings.\n- Sources: Class instantiations, attribute checks.\n- Sinks: No external data sinks.\n- Flows: Exception creation, attribute access.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behaviors.\n- Analysis: Typical exception hierarchy, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for HTTP errors.\n- Sources: Class inheritance, attribute checks.\n- Sinks: No external data processing.\n- Flows: Raising exceptions based on errors.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: Straightforward, standard pattern.\n- Conclusion: No malicious or security issues.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception hierarchy for Requests.\n- Sources: Imports, class definitions.\n- Sinks: No data sinks.\n- Flows: Standard exception raising.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Typical exception class code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code content:** All reports confirm that the code is purely class definitions for exception handling within a network request library.\n- **Malware risk:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None, as no data manipulation, network activity, or sensitive operations are present.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n- Given the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions that this code is safe, standard, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
