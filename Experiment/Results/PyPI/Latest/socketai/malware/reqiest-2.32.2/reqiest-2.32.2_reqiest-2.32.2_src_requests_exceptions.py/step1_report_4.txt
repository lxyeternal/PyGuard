{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes used by the Requests library for handling various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments, class inheritance, and attribute checks related to HTTP responses and requests.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows are minimal; the code mainly raises exceptions and does not process external data for execution.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve raising or initializing exception objects based on request/response errors, with no external data manipulation beyond attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The class hierarchy and exception handling are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and standard for an exception module in a network request library. It defines various exception classes for handling specific error cases, with no signs of malicious behavior or code injection. There are no indications of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious network activities. The attribute access and error handling follow typical patterns, and there are no external data processing or command execution points.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception definition module for the Requests library, containing no malicious, suspicious, or security-compromising elements. It appears safe, with no malware indicators or security risks.",
