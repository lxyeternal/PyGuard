  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content in the Code:**\n- The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.\n- It imports exceptions from urllib3 and a compat module.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No data is being sent or received; only exception classes are defined.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n- They acknowledge the absence of data flows, external data handling, or network activity.\n- The reasoning that the code is safe and free of malicious intent is consistent with the code content.\n- No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the analysis.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are 1.0 or 1, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- The code does not perform any network operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation is detected.\n- Therefore, assigning a high risk score is unjustified; zero is appropriate.\n\n**5. Malware Score Reflection:**\n- Since the code contains no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior, malware score should be 0.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports base their conclusions on the actual content, not assumptions.\n- They correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- All reports assign low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n- This consistency is appropriate given the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for an HTTP request library. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, no obfuscation, and no data leaks or network activity. The high confidence levels further support this conclusion.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is warranted.",
