{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes used by the Requests library for handling different error scenarios during HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code imports exceptions from urllib3 and a local compat module; it also defines classes that may be instantiated during runtime error handling.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes may be raised or caught, but there are no direct data sinks that send data over the network or write to files; no untrusted input handling or data leaks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are raised in response to various error conditions, but there are no complex data flows or source-to-sink paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of class definitions for exceptions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes for a requests-like library, mainly inheriting from built-in exceptions or other exception classes. It includes proper inheritance and comments. No external or internal data manipulation, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent. The code is purely structural and intended for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard exception class definitions module for handling HTTP request errors. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. It is safe and consistent with normal library code.",
