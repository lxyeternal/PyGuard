  "sinks": "None; this code does not write data to external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python class definitions for various exceptions related to HTTP requests. It imports specific exceptions and defines custom exception classes, some with multiple inheritance. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or network operations are present. No obfuscated code or indicators of malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions for a request handling library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this module.",
