{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in Requests library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; purely data structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as code is only defining classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard implementation of dictionary-like classes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which manages headers or similar data insensitive to key case, and LookupDict, a simple dict subclass with a custom repr and get method. Both classes do not process external input or perform network or system operations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The classes operate purely as data containers with standard Python patterns. There is no evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of utility data structures used for handling case-insensitive keys and lookup behaviors. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It appears safe and legitimate.",
