  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries used internally in the Requests library. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate; minor correction in the copy() method is recommended for correctness but does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and legitimate."
