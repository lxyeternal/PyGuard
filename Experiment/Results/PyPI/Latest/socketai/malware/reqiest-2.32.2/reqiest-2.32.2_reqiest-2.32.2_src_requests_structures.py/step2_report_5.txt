  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines two classes, with no malicious behavior or anomalies. The confidence is perfect (1), malware score is 0, and security risk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, implementing standard data structures for internal use. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware.\n\n- **Score justifications:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is also correctly low.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed analysis indicating standard implementation, no external data flows, or malicious behavior. Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still high.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The code is purely internal data structures with no external side effects.\n\n- **Score justifications:** Malware remains at 0, security risk at 0.1 seems reasonable given the code’s nature, but perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed. The low security risk score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. Confidence is 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code’s behavior. No external calls, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Score justifications:** Malware at 0 is appropriate; security risk at 0 is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar conclusion: benign utility classes, no malicious activity, straightforward implementation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no suspicious behavior, standard code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n\n- Given the code is purely utility data structures with no external effects, I would assign the following scores:\n\n  - **Malware:** 0 for all reports.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.\n  - **Risk:** 0 for all reports, or at most 0.1 for the second report, which already reflects minimal concern.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe, standard, and without malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.1 for minimal security concern)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the reports are accurate and justified.",
