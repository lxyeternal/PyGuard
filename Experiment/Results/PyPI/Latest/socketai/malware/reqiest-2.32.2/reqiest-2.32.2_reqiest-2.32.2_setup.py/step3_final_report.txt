  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'requests' Python library, performing environment checks, reading version info, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'src/requests/__version__.py' via open() and exec(); reads README.md; command-line arguments for 'publish'.",
  "sinks": "Uses exec() to execute version file content; os.system() for packaging and upload commands.",
  "flows": "exec() executes contents of version file; command-line triggers os.system() commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external version file; reliance on os.system() for packaging commands.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks with straightforward logic. The use of exec() on an external file introduces a potential security risk if the version file is compromised, as arbitrary code could execute. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The os.system() calls are controlled and only triggered with specific arguments. Overall, the script is benign but warrants caution regarding the exec() pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is generally safe and standard, with the primary security concern being the use of exec() to load version info. No evidence of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk ~0.2-0.3) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
