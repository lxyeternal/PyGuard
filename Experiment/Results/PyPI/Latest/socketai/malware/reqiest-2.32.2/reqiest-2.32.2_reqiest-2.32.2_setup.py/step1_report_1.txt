The main concern is the use of exec() to execute the contents of the version file ('__version__.py'), which could be malicious if that file were replaced or tampered with, as exec() runs arbitrary code. The packaging and upload commands via os.system are standard, but their execution is straightforward and does not involve untrusted input. Overall, the script does not contain malicious code intentionally embedded but relies on executing external code via exec(), which can be risky if the source files are compromised. No evidence of malware or malicious backdoors is apparent, but the exec() usage warrants caution.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package. The only notable security concern is the dynamic execution of version info via exec(), which could be exploited if the version file is maliciously modified. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware, but the exec() call should be scrutinized or replaced with safer alternatives.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.3\n}",
