  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard cookie utilities, reading request headers, response headers, URL, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie extraction, creation, and header generation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious patterns; code is standard for cookie management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, typical implementation; high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's functionality. The security risk score is low, reflecting minimal concern. The malware score is correctly zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; standard cookie handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie headers, cookie jars, extraction, and management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious constructs; standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears normal and safe. The security risk is minimal, and malware score is appropriately zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility functions, cookie extraction, management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie header creation, extraction, deletion.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis matches the code's behavior. The low security risk score is justified, and malware is correctly scored zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility utilities, cookie extraction, management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie headers, extraction, setting/removing cookies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious constructs; standard cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Benign, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No malicious activity detected; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for cookie handling, extraction, management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookie headers, extraction, merging.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors; standard code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully benign, high confidence (1).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code. No risks or malware present.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Code Functionality:** All reports confirm the code is a standard, legitimate implementation of cookie utilities for the requests library.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Scores of 0 across all reports are appropriate; no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, consistent with the code's purpose; scores between 0.1 and 0.2 are justified.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the thorough, consistent analysis.\n\n### **My Final Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, standard cookie management utility.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The code is a standard, safe, and open-source utility module for cookie handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.",
