  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies in requests, including extraction, management, and conversion of cookies between different formats.",
  "sources": "Requests and responses for cookies, headers, URLs, and request data; environment variables indirectly via request headers.",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie extraction to jar, cookie setting/removal, and data returned or manipulated within cookie management functions.",
  "flows": "Request data flows into cookie extraction and cookie header generation; response headers flow into cookie jar extraction; cookie jar data flows into cookie header creation and cookie removal.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of threading with fallback, but no evident malicious intent. The code mostly deals with cookie management and compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mechanisms to wrap requests and responses, extract cookies into a jar, manage cookies with a dict-like interface, create cookies from parameters or morsels, and merge cookie jars. All operations are standard for cookie handling; no suspicious behaviors like network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. No hardcoded secrets or insecure operations are identified. The functions serve compatibility and utility purposes and do not perform any unintended or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of cookie management utilities for requests. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this module. It is a legitimate component for cookie handling in HTTP requests.",
