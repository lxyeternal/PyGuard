  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for managing cookies within the requests library, including classes and functions to handle cookie extraction, manipulation, and conversion between formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from HTTP response headers, request URL, and cookie parameters; accesses environment through imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Adds headers to requests, extracts cookies from responses, manipulates cookie storage, and potentially injects or clears cookies within the jar.",
  "flows": "HTTP response headers are read and parsed into cookies; cookies are created and stored; cookies can be added to requests; cookies are extracted from responses into the jar; cookie headers are generated for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code is standard for cookie handling and includes standard exception handling. No evidence of data exfiltration, network communications, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management functions compatible with the requests library, wrapping existing cookie jar functionalities, converting cookies, and providing dictionary-like access. It does not perform any network communications, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The classes and functions follow typical patterns for cookie handling, with no unusual logic, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The functions are straightforward and serve typical purposes without malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable abuse, or code injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, legitimate implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. It performs no malicious actions and is consistent with typical open-source cookie handling code. No security threats or malware are identified.",
