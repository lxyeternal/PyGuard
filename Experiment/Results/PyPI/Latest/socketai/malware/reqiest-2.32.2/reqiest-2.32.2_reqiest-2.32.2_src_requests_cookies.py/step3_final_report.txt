{
  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities, including extraction, creation, and header handling for requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Request headers, response headers, URL parsing, cookie objects (e.g., Morsel), and internal cookie jar data.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers sent in requests, cookie jar modifications, and cookie extraction from responses.",
  "flows": "Request headers are read to produce cookie headers; response headers are parsed to extract cookies into the jar; cookies are managed via set, get, and delete functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard for cookie handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management functions, including extraction from responses, creation, and cookie jar manipulation. It uses typical patterns, no obfuscation, and no network activity or data exfiltration. The threading lock is for thread safety but does not introduce malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The functions align with expected behaviors for cookie utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
