  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard cookie handling functions, classes, and extraction mechanisms.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Code is standard, legitimate, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (low), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The code is a typical cookie utility module. The security risk score is slightly above zero, justified by the fact that it handles cookies which could be misused if misconfigured, but nothing malicious is present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie management, no malicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's content. No malicious activity, just utility functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on compatibility functions, standard cookie extraction, management, and no suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 (low), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no signs of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Highlights standard cookie handling, no suspicious behaviors, mentions threading for thread safety but no malicious implications.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score is justified given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Emphasizes standard utility functions, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of cookie management utilities. No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), justified by the fact that cookie handling could be exploited if misused, but the code itself is benign.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a legitimate, open-source utility module for cookie management.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- The functions and classes follow standard patterns.\n- No suspicious data flows, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n### **Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect that cookie handling can be misused but is not malicious in itself)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate, considering potential misuse but no inherent malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.",
