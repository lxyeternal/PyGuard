  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies between requests and urllib3, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion functions.",
  "sources": "Reads request URL, request headers, response headers, cookies from CookieJar, cookie attributes (name, value, domain, path, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie storage in CookieJar, cookie extraction from responses, cookie deletion, cookie updates.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers are used to create MockRequest; response headers are used in extract_cookies_to_jar; cookies are added/removed via set() and remove_cookie_by_name; cookies are retrieved via get() and __getitem__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Functions perform standard cookie handling. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling and compatibility functions for the requests library. It converts cookies, manages them in a dictionary-like structure, extracts cookies from responses, and deletes cookies by name. All operations appear consistent with cookie management. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The functions are straightforward and perform expected behaviors for cookie management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. Its design and content align with normal cookie management practices without signs of sabotage or malware.",
