{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the default CA certificate bundle location provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi module import and the 'where' function call.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' outputs the certificate bundle path, which could be considered a data sink but not malicious.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() -> print() outputs the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package to locate the trusted CA bundle. When run as a script, it prints this path. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. It solely outputs a known, static resource location. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple utility script that outputs the path to the CA bundle provided by certifi. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
