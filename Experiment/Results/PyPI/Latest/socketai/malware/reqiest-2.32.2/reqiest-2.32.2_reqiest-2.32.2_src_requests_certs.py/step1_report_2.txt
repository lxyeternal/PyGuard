{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA certificate bundle path used by the requests library, primarily for verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path from the certifi package via the where() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could be exploited or leak; the code only prints a file path.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where()) is used to output the CA bundle path; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from certifi and prints the path to the CA bundle when executed directly. The purpose is to identify the default CA bundle location for SSL verification. No user input, untrusted data, or external commands are involved. The code performs a simple, read-only operation and outputs a static value. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a utility purpose of reporting the default CA certificate bundle path. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
