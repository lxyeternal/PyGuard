{
  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for validating SSL connections.",
  "sources": "The certifi.where() function, which returns the path to the CA bundle.",
  "sinks": "The output of the script (printing the CA bundle path) does not directly lead to any data leak or security effect; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input: None; Output: The printed path to the CA bundle, which is a trusted resource, not untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward, with a single import and a print statement.",
  "analysis": "The script imports certifi's where() function to output the path to the trusted CA bundle. There are no user inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no risky operations. The code's purpose is to identify and print a trusted certificate path, which is standard and safe. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, transparent, and safe. It serves a benign purpose of exposing the CA bundle path used for SSL verification. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
