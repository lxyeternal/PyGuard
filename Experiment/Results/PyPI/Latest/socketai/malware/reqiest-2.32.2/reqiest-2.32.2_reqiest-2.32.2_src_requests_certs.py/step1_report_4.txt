{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, primarily for verifying SSL certificates.",
  "sources": "The code reads the certificate bundle location using 'certifi.where()'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only prints the certificate bundle path.",
  "flows": "Input: None. Output: Printing the certificate bundle path; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, minimal, and uses standard libraries with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from the 'certifi' package to determine the default CA bundle path and prints it when run as the main program. It contains no user input handling, no data transmission, and no suspicious or malicious code behavior. The code appears to be a simple utility for informational purposes. There are no indications of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a simple utility function without any malicious behavior or security risks. It merely outputs the location of the CA bundle used by requests.",
