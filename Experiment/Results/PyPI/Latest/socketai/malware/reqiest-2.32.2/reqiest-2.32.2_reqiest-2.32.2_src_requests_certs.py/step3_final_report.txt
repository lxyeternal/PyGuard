  "purpose": "This script outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' module.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' -> print(where()) when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function from a well-known library and prints its output. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain secrets. The purpose is solely to display the CA bundle path. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present. The code's simplicity and reliance on trusted libraries indicate a benign utility script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that outputs the certifi CA bundle path. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
