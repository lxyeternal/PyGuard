  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function retrieves the certificate bundle path, which is then printed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and uses standard library and certifi package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from 'certifi' to obtain the default CA bundle path and prints it when executed as a script. It does not process untrusted data, contain hardcoded secrets, or perform any network or file operations beyond retrieving a known file path. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a simple utility script consistent with standard practices for managing CA certificates in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the default CA certificate bundle path from certifi. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code.",
