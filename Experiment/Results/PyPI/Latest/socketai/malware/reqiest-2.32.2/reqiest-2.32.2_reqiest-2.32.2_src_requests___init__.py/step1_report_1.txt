    "Check SSL support -> Inject pyopenssl if necessary",
    "Suppress urllib3 dependency warnings -> Setup logging",
    "Import core modules and functions for requests functionality"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of 'assert' statements for version checks, which can be disabled and might mask issues",
    "No apparent suspicious code injecting data, connecting to external servers, or exfiltrating data",
    "Dependency warnings and version assertions are typical for setup scripts, not malicious actions"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs version compatibility checks, dependency imports, SSL fallback handling, and logging setup. There are no hardcoded secrets, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious code segments. The use of 'assert' for version checks could potentially be disabled, but this is standard practice for development, not an attack vector. The only noteworthy point is that SSL fallback injects pyopenssl if necessary, which is a normal setup step. No suspicious data flows, input/output channels, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup and compatibility checking module for the 'requests' Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to ensure proper dependency versions and SSL support. No anomalous or malicious code is detected.",
