  "purpose": "Dependency checks, compatibility validation, SSL fallback setup, and environment configuration for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Version import statements, assert statements for version validation, conditional SSL and cryptography checks, fallback injections of pyopenssl.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no network connections, no data leaks or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Version info imported -> assertions and warnings -> potential fallback injections -> environment modifications.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' statements for version validation (can be disabled), injection of pyopenssl for SSL fallback, standard dependency checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dependency validation, environment compatibility checks, and SSL fallback mechanisms. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The use of 'assert' statements is typical but can be disabled, which could bypass checks, though this is not malicious. The injection of pyopenssl for SSL fallback is a common practice and not inherently malicious. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The dependency version checks and warnings are standard for ensuring compatibility. Overall, the code is a typical setup routine for a robust HTTP library, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup and compatibility validation script for the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting standard dependency and environment management practices.",
