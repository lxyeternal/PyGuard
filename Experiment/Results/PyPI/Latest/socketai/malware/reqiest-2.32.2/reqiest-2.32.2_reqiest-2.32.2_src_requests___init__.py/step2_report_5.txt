  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard dependency/version checks, SSL fallback, and setup.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors. Use of `assert` statements for version checks is common but can be disabled; however, this isn't inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, given it's a setup script).\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar dependency management, compatibility checks.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (still low, standard setup).\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct. The code is typical for dependency validation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Dependency checks, SSL fallback.\n- **Findings:** The only noteworthy aspect is the conditional injection of `pyopenssl` if SSL lacks SNI support. While this could be exploited if the environment is compromised, in normal operation, it is a standard fallback.\n- **Potential concern:** If an attacker could manipulate the environment or the `pyopenssl` injection, it might interfere with SSL/TLS, but this is a known fallback mechanism, not malicious per se.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (acceptable).\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Dependency validation, compatibility, fallback.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no malicious network activity, standard warnings/assertions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Dependency management, SSL fallback.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or network activity. The process is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 for some reports, but justified given the dependency checks and fallback mechanisms are standard and necessary parts of the library setup.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code performs dependency version validation, environment detection, and SSL fallback configuration—standard and well-understood practices.\n- No network connections to suspicious domains, no data exfiltration, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Use of `assert` statements for version checks is common, though they can be disabled; this is not malicious.\n- The injection of `pyopenssl` is a known fallback for SSL support, not malicious.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, related to dependency management and SSL fallback, standard in such setup scripts)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior. No adjustments needed.",
