  "purpose": "Fetches data from a specific URL and prints the response or an error message.",
  "sources": "The line requesting data from 'https://qkqwtmfhcgmiadhtmgmbbkugp4w1lxavf.oast.fun'.",
  "sinks": "The response.text is printed to standard output, which could potentially leak data if response contains sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Request is made to the URL (source), and if successful, response text is printed (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The URL is a suspicious, potentially malicious domain (oast.fun is known for security testing and monitoring), which could indicate malicious activity. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'requests' library to perform an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. If the response status code is 200, it prints the response text; otherwise, it prints an error message. The use of a known security testing domain suggests the code might be part of a security assessment or could be malicious if used without context. There are no obfuscation techniques or hidden code. The code's purpose appears straightforward but the domain involved is suspicious, raising concern about potential malicious intent or data exfiltration if the URL is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple HTTP GET request and outputs the response. The use of a suspicious domain indicates possible malicious behavior or a security testing context. No malware or obfuscation detected, but the domain choice warrants caution. Overall security risk is moderate due to the domain involved.",
