  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and performs a basic arithmetic operation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'add_one' that takes a single parameter 'number' and returns the value incremented by 1. There are no external data sources, environment variables, or network interactions. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no complex logic. The function appears to serve a simple arithmetic purpose without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility function with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
