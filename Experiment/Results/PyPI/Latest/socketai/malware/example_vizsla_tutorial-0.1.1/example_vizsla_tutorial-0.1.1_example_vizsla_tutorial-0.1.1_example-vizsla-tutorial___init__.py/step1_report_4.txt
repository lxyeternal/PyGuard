  "purpose": "Provides basic logging message and a simple addition function.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for the function 'simple_math_operation'.",
  "sinks": "Return statement of 'simple_math_operation'. Print statement in 'log_message'.",
  "flows": "Data from input parameters 'a' and 'b' flows to the return statement; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code, no unusual language features, and no dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two simple functions: one prints a greeting message, the other performs addition. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The functions are straightforward and do not interact with external systems, network, or untrusted inputs in a suspicious manner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious intent. It performs simple, harmless operations without security risks.",
