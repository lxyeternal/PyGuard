  "purpose": "Provide simple logging message and perform a basic addition operation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' in simple_math_operation.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in simple_math_operation; print statement in log_message.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into addition operation, result is returned. No external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code is straightforward with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one prints a static message; the other performs a simple addition. There are no external input sources, no data leaks, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscated logic. The functions are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves basic logging and arithmetic purposes.",
