{
  "purpose": "Provides simple logging message and performs basic addition operation",
  "sources": "Function calls to log_message() and simple_math_operation() with input parameters a and b",
  "sinks": "The print statement in log_message() outputs to console; simple_math_operation() returns result",
  "flows": "Input parameters a and b flow into simple_math_operation() and return the sum; log_message() outputs a static message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two straightforward functions: one outputs a static message to the console, the other performs an addition of two input values. There are no external data sources, no network activity, no use of environment variables, and no suspicious logic. The functions serve simple purposes without any malicious intent or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing basic logging and arithmetic operations. No signs of malware or security risks are present.",
