{
  "purpose": "The code defines two simple functions: one for logging a message and another for performing a basic addition operation.",
  "sources": "The functions take input parameters 'a' and 'b' for the addition; 'print' outputs a fixed message.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs a fixed message; no untrusted data is used in the output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' are used directly in the addition; no external data flows into other parts of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions: 'log_message' outputs a static message indicating package purpose; 'simple_math_operation' returns the sum of two input values. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive data handling or network activity. The code appears to be simple utility functions with benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a basic utility module with no suspicious or harmful elements.",
