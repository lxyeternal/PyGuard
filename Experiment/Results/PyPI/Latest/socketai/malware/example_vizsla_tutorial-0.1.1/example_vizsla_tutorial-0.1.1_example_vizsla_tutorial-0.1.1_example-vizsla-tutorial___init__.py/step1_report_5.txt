  "purpose": "Provides basic logging message and a simple addition function",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' in simple_math_operation",
  "sinks": "Return statement in simple_math_operation; print statement in log_message",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into the addition operation; no external data flow to sinks outside parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two straightforward functions: one that prints a static message and another that adds two input values. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process external input sources in a way that could lead to injection or data leaks. It performs simple operations with no external dependencies or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a basic utility module with simple print and addition operations.",
