{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple logging and addition functions with no external data sources or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; functions use static messages and parameters only.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs beyond print statements.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow only into addition; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, clear code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple functions: one prints a static message, the other returns the sum of two inputs. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscation are detected. All reports correctly identify the benign, straightforward nature of the code. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with confidence at 1. No issues or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
