  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious data flows.",
  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, user inputs, stdin; potential sinks include network connections, file writes, system commands, subprocesses.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands, network transmission, file operations, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "flows": "Untrusted sources (env vars, stdin, user input) to sinks (system commands, network, file operations), possibly via obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, misleading variable names, minimal comments, suspicious data flows, inconsistent or complex control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with potential hardcoded secrets and suspicious data flows. These indicators suggest possible malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or backdoors. The suspicion is supported by the presence of obfuscation and code that could execute untrusted input. However, without concrete code snippets, certainty is limited. The scores assigned reflect moderate suspicion, with malware likelihood around 0.45, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk at 0.65 for the most suspicious case. Benign reports show straightforward code with no anomalies, justifying low malware and risk scores. Overall, the analysis aligns with the suspicion levels, and the scores are consistent with the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious features, notably in reports 1 and 2, with signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution. While not definitively malicious, these patterns warrant further inspection before deployment. The other reports indicate benign code. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, with moderate concern primarily in the most suspicious cases.",
