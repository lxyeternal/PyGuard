{
  "purpose": "The code manages database version verification, backups, and migration for BitcoinLib, ensuring schema consistency and updating version info.",
  "sources": "User input for confirmation, file system for database files, database queries for version and data retrieval.",
  "sinks": "File move operations for backups, database insert/update commands, user prompts for proceeding.",
  "flows": "User confirmation triggers file move; database backup is read; data is migrated from old to new schema; version info is updated.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant imports, use of 'input()' for confirmation which could be bypassed in non-interactive environments, but these are standard patterns and not security issues.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard database schema validation, backup, and data migration with safeguards like user confirmation. It does not contain network activity, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The data conversions and file operations follow typical practices. The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with legitimate maintenance utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured database migration utility for BitcoinLib. It shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The operational risk is minimal, primarily related to file handling and user prompts, which are standard safeguards. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is appropriately set at 0.2.",
