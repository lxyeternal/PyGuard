{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing main components and running pre-install checks during installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for main, version, and optional pre-install checks.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules and attempts to run run_pre_install during import, but no data flows from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a try-except block to conditionally execute run_pre_install; no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and version info, then attempts to run a pre-install function if available. The try-except block suppresses ImportError, ensuring no crash if run_pre_install is missing. No external network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure is typical for package initialization scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization script without malicious intent or security risks. It conditionally runs a pre-install check, which is common practice.",
