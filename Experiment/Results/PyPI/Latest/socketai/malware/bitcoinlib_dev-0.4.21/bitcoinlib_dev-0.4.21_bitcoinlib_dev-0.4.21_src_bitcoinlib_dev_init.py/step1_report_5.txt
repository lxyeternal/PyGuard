  "sinks": "Potential execution of run_pre_install() during import, which could run arbitrary code if maliciously altered.",
  "flows": "Import of run_pre_install() from .installer is executed during module import, then run_pre_install() is called, which may execute code if the function is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic invocation of run_pre_install() during import could be risky if the function is malicious or compromised. No other anomalies are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core functions and version info, then attempts to run run_pre_install() during module import. This pattern is often used for setup checks. The try-except block prevents import failure. The primary concern is the automatic execution of run_pre_install() at import time, which, if altered or malicious, could execute unwanted code. No other suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup tasks with a potentially risky automatic pre-install check. However, this pattern is common in package initialization. No direct malicious intent or malicious code is evident. The main risk is if run_pre_install() is compromised, which could execute arbitrary code during import.",
