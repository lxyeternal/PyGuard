{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up a Python package's main module, exposing 'main' and '__version__', and conditionally running pre-install checks during import.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'cli', 'version', and conditional import of 'installer'. The call to 'run_pre_install()' if available.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-critical actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward and do not process external input; 'run_pre_install()' is called if available, but its internal behavior is unknown.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of 'run_pre_install()' during module import is unusual but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and attempts to run a pre-install check if the 'installer' module is available. The pre-install function is called during import, which is a common practice for setup scripts, though it can sometimes be misused for malicious checks. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious network activity. The code's structure is simple and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for package setup, with a conditional pre-install hook. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on this fragment.",
