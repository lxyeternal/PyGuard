{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the module's exports, attempts to run a pre-install check, and manages versioning information.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'main', '__version__', and 'run_pre_install' from local modules; conditional execution of 'run_pre_install()' during import.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'run_pre_install()' which could contain malicious code if compromised, but in this context, it is a function call within a try-except block.",
  "flows": "Import 'run_pre_install' → call 'run_pre_install()' during module import, if available.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable aspect is the automatic invocation of 'run_pre_install()' during import, which could be misused if 'run_pre_install()' is malicious. However, no actual code for 'run_pre_install' is provided here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports essential components and attempts to run a pre-install check upon import, encapsulated in a try-except block to prevent errors if the installer module isn't present. This is a common pattern to perform setup tasks during installation. No suspicious or malicious code or obfuscated constructs are present. The 'run_pre_install()' function's content is unknown, so its behavior cannot be assessed, but the invocation itself is standard practice for setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup module with a potentially risky but common pattern of running pre-install checks during import. No direct malicious behavior or malicious code is evident in this snippet. The suspicious aspect is the automatic invocation of a potentially unknown function during import, which warrants review of 'run_pre_install' if available, but as it stands, the code does not exhibit malicious intent.",
