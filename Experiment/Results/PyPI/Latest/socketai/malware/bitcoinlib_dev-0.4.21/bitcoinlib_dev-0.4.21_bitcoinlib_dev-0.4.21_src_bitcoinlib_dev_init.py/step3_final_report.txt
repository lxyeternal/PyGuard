  "purpose": "Initialize package by importing core functions and version info; execute pre-install checks if available.",
  "sources": "Imports 'main' and '__version__'; attempts to import 'run_pre_install' from '.installer'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'run_pre_install()' during import, which could run arbitrary code if malicious.",
  "flows": "Importing 'run_pre_install' and calling it directly during module load.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic invocation of 'run_pre_install()' during import; no content of 'run_pre_install' provided to assess behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization pattern with a conditional pre-install hook. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the automatic execution of an external function during import, which could be exploited if 'run_pre_install' is malicious. Malware score is 0 due to lack of evidence; obfuscation score is 0; security risk score is moderate (around 0.2) reflecting the potential risk of executing unknown code during import. Confidence is high given the simplicity of the code and the pattern used.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and follows common setup patterns. The automatic call to 'run_pre_install()' warrants caution if the function's implementation is untrusted, but no evidence of malicious activity exists. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
