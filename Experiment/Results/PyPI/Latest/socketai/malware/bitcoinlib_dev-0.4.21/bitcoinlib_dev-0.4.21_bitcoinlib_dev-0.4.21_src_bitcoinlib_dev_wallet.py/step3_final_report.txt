  "purpose": "Manage Bitcoin wallets, generate keys, import and send transactions using bitcoinlib.",
  "sources": "User inputs (args), Mnemonic generation, JSON transaction files, wallet methods (create, import, send).",
  "sinks": "Print statements revealing passphrases, private keys, transaction hashes; file operations for transaction import.",
  "flows": "Input args -> wallet creation/import -> sensitive data generation -> printing sensitive info -> transaction processing.",
  "anomalies": "Printing sensitive data (passphrases, private keys, transaction hashes), potential bug in wallet creation parameter (keys=passphrase).",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet management functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. Sensitive data is printed, which poses a security risk but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present. Minor bug in '_create_standard_wallet' regarding parameter name 'keys' instead of possibly 'key' or 'passphrase'. The code relies on standard libraries and practices. The security concern is the exposure of sensitive data via print statements, which should be replaced with secure logging. No signs of supply chain attack vectors or malware. Overall, the code is a typical implementation with a security best practice issue rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Bitcoin wallet management tool with no malicious code detected. The primary security concern is the printing of sensitive data, which could lead to data leakage if logs are accessed insecurely. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to data exposure. It is recommended to avoid printing sensitive information in production environments.",
