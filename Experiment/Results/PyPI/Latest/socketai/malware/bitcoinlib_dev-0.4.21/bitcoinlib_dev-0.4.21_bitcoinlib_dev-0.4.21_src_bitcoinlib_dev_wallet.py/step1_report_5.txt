  "purpose": "This code manages Bitcoin wallets, including creation, listing, key generation, transaction import, and sending transactions.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from arguments (args), wallet files (JSON files), and wallet/database queries.",
  "sinks": "Printing wallet info, transaction hashes, and possibly sending transactions over the network.",
  "flows": "Input from args or files flows into wallet operations, transaction import, and sending functions; outputs include console logs and network broadcasts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious external connections. Wallet operations and transaction handling appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and the bitcoinlib for wallet management. It provides functions for creating wallets, listing existing wallets, generating keys, importing transactions, and sending transactions. All data inputs appear to come from function parameters, command-line args, or files, with no evident hardcoded secrets. The transaction import and send functions perform standard operations, with exception handling. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are apparent. The code does not perform any obfuscated operations or unusual dynamic code execution. It appears to be legitimate wallet management code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements typical Bitcoin wallet management features with standard practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are identified. It appears safe and does not exhibit supply chain attacks or malware characteristics.",
