The primary security concern is the printing of sensitive data, which could lead to data leakage if logs are accessed insecurely. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to data exposure. It is recommended to avoid printing sensitive information in production environments."
