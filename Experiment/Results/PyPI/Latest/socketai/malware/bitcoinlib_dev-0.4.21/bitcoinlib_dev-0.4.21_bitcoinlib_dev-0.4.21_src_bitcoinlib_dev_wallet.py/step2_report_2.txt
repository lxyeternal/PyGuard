  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and applying security assessment principles.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code performs standard wallet operations using bitcoinlib.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.\n- Sensitive data (passphrases, keys) are printed, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n- Transaction data is read from JSON files, with appropriate exception handling.\n- The code does not contain any logic that would suggest supply chain attack vectors or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2**\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Correctly identifies that the code is standard wallet management.\n  - Notes the security concern of printing sensitive info.\n  - No malicious intent or code.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe score of 0.2 for security risk is reasonable given the exposure of sensitive info, but no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2**\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Similar to Report 1, confirms standard operations.\n  - No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n  - Notes potential privacy issues due to printing sensitive data.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2**\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Reiterates that the code is standard.\n  - Highlights the security concern of printing private keys/passphrases.\n  - No malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2**\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Same conclusion: standard wallet management.\n  - No suspicious activity.\n  - Printing sensitive info remains the main concern.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2**\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Same findings as others.\n  - No malicious code detected.\n  - Standard operations.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across all reports is appropriate, mainly due to printing sensitive data, which is a security concern but not an attack vector.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to sensitive info exposure via print statements)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward implementation of wallet management functions with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The main security concern is the handling of sensitive data in logs or console output, which should be avoided or secured in production environments.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nIf this code were to be deployed in a real environment, best practices would recommend removing or securing print statements that output private keys or passphrases to prevent leakage.",
