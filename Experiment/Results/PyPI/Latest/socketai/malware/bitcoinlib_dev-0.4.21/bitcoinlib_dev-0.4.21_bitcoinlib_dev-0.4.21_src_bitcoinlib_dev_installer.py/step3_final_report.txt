  "purpose": "Manage setup and cleanup of the 'clw' command-line utility, including removing existing instances, creating wrappers or symlinks, and copying database files.",
  "sources": "find_existing_clw(), get_bitcoinlib_db_dir(), EngineBackup, filesystem operations (os.remove, open, symlink, os.chmod)",
  "sinks": "Filesystem modifications (removing, creating files/symlinks), potential execution of wrapper scripts",
  "flows": "find_existing_clw() identifies existing command -> remove_existing_clw() deletes it -> ensure_clw_symlink() creates wrapper or symlink -> run_post_install() copies database files",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity; creation of wrapper scripts and symlinks could be exploited if environment is compromised",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks for a command-line utility, managing existing command files and creating wrappers or symlinks depending on OS. External functions are not detailed but are likely benign. No malicious routines, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The main risk stems from filesystem manipulations that could be exploited if an attacker gains control over the environment. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3), reflecting potential exploitation in a compromised environment. The code's straightforward nature and lack of malicious behavior justify these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup utility with no active malicious behavior. Its main risk lies in environmental exploitation, not in the code itself. The current scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
