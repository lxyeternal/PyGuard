  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate wallet CLI with privacy considerations due to transmitting sensitive data in plaintext. There is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The moderate risk score reflects privacy concerns rather than active threats. Overall, the code is benign but should be reviewed for secure data handling practices."
