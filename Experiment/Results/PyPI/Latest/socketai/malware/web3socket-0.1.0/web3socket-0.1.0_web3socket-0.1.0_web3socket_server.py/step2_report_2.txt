  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code implements a WebSocket server with policy handling, reading environment variables, and serving files from disk.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from environment variables and filesystem reads into response handling. WebSocket object creation is based on environment data.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of broad exception handling, deprecated syntax, and unsanitized file paths.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate; no malicious behaviors or obfuscation. Exception handling could be improved, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard server setup, file serving, and WebSocket handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad exception handling, no hardcoded secrets, standard external modules.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate server code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on serving specific files, environment variables, and socket management.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of broad exception handling, no secrets, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate server code, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar pattern: static file serving, WebSocket, policy server, environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** Outdated syntax, broad exception handling, no malicious indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard server implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Focuses on serving files, handling WebSocket, environment variables, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad exception handling, unsanitized file reads, but no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate server code, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and no evidence of malicious activity is present. The code is a typical server implementation, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in all cases, justified by broad exception handling and unsanitized file access, which are security concerns but not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain **0**; no malicious activity is evident.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain **0**; code is clear.\n- The **security risk score** could be marginally increased to **0.3** due to broad exception handling and unsanitized file access, but given the context, 0.2 remains reasonable.\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (current 0.2 is acceptable)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a WebSocket server with static file serving and policy management, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main concerns are related to exception handling practices rather than malicious intent.",
