  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code and considering the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a straightforward server setup for a FlashPolicyServer, primarily for cross-domain WebSocket policy serving.\n- The code is simple, with no input processing, no external data handling, no obfuscated code, and no credentials.\n- The server is started with `server.start()` and runs indefinitely with `serve_forever()`.\n- No suspicious network activity or external communications are evident beyond the server listening.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the server's role.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior; code appears benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Also finds no malicious intent; standard setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.2 (slightly higher, but still low), confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk, but justified given the server's exposure. No malware concern.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same, with emphasis on cross-domain policy.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard server.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior; standard server startup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward server setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, given the server exposes a network service that could be misused if misconfigured, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correct at 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly higher (0.1-0.2) is justified, considering the server exposes a network interface. No change needed.\n- **Scores consistency:** All are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to network exposure but no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.",
