  "purpose": "Initialize and run a WebSocket Flash Policy Server to serve cross-domain policy files.",
  "sources": "Importing web3socket.policyserver.FlashPolicyServer, server.start(), server.serve_forever()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; server listens on network interface, but no data leaks or malicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Server initialization -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever() with logging to stderr",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward server setup with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard FlashPolicyServer class, initializes it with 'noisy=True', starts the server, and logs server details. No input processing, no external data handling, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The purpose is to serve cross-domain policies, which is a common and legitimate use case. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The server's exposure is typical for such services, and no signs of sabotage or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a WebSocket Flash Policy Server. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
