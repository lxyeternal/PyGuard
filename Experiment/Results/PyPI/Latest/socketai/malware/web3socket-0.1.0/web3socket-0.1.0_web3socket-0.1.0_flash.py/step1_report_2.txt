  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server for WebSocket connections, primarily for cross-domain policy management.",
  "sources": "import sys, web3socket.policyserver.FlashPolicyServer; server.start()",
  "sinks": "server.start(), server.serve_forever()",
  "flows": "Initialization of server object, starting the server, then serving indefinitely",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and does not include any obfuscated or suspicious logic. The only notable aspect is the default starting of a Flash policy server, which could be exploited if misconfigured, but is standard for WebSocket server setups.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, creates an instance of FlashPolicyServer with a 'noisy' parameter set to True, then starts the server and outputs its host and port to standard error. It runs indefinitely with serve_forever(). No external inputs are read in a malicious way, and no untrusted data handling or network communication outside of the server itself is evident. The code appears to be a standard server setup without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for a WebSocket flash policy server. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues within this code fragment. It primarily facilitates cross-domain WebSocket connections, which is a common requirement in web applications.",
