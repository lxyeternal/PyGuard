  "purpose": "Start a Web3 WebSocket Flash Policy Server for cross-domain policy handling.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module; initializing FlashPolicyServer object from web3socket.policyserver",
  "sinks": "Printing server address info to standard error",
  "flows": "Server initialization and start -> Logging server details to stderr",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no suspicious data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and initializes a FlashPolicyServer instance with 'noisy=True'. It then starts the server and logs server host and port information to stderr. The server is likely used for cross-domain policy serving in WebSocket contexts. No data is read from untrusted sources or written to external locations. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup for a WebSocket flash policy server with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
