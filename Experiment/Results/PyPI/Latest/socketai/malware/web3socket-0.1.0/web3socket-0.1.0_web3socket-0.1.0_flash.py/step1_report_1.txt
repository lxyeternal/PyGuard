{
  "purpose": "Starts a Flash Policy Server for WebSocket connections, primarily to serve cross-domain policy files.",
  "sources": "Imports from web3socket.policyserver and the server.start() method; reads sys.stderr for server information.",
  "sinks": "Outputs server host and port information to standard error; no other data sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of the server object, starting the server, and outputting server details to stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious external communications or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a FlashPolicyServer object with 'noisy=True', starts the server, and prints server details to stderr. The server's purpose is to serve cross-domain policy files for WebSocket connections. No input data processing, no untrusted data flows, and no malicious behavior are evident. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a legitimate setup for WebSocket cross-domain policy serving.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a legitimate purpose related to WebSocket security policies, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
