  "purpose": "Start a Flash Policy Server for WebSocket connections, likely for enabling cross-domain policy in a web environment.",
  "sources": "Importing FlashPolicyServer class from web3socket.policyserver, initializing and starting the server.",
  "sinks": "The server listens on a network socket, but no untrusted data handling or external input is directly processed.",
  "flows": "Server initialization (import) -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever(), with output to stderr regarding server host and port.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No user input or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class intended to run a WebSocket flash policy server, which is used to facilitate cross-domain WebSocket communication. It initializes and starts this server, then outputs its listening address to standard error. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for hosting a policy server without any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or code that could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup for a WebSocket flash policy server with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
