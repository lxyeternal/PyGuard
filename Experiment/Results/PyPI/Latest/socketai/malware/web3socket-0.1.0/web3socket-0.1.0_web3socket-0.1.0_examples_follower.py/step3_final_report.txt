  "purpose": "A server managing WebSocket-like connections, serving static files, and broadcasting messages to connected clients.",
  "sources": "environ['PATH_INFO'], environ.get('web3socket'), open(path), socket.receive(), socket.getpeername()",
  "sinks": "socket.send(message), open(file), print statements, socket.receive()",
  "flows": "environ['PATH_INFO'] or 'web3socket' input -> serve_file or receive -> socket.send -> print/logging",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert message is None' in receive() which can cause server crashes if a message is received; no input validation on file paths; no secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a WebSocket-like server that serves static files and broadcasts messages to connected sockets. No malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration activities are present. The assertion in receive() is a logic flaw that could lead to denial of service but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity is detected. The socket handling and file serving are straightforward, with minimal security risks. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to potential server stability issues, which are not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor logic flaw that could cause server crashes but no active malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.",
