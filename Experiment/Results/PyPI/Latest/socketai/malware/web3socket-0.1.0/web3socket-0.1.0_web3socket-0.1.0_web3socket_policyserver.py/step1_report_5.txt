{
  "purpose": "This code implements a simple Flash cross-domain policy server that responds with a specific XML policy to clients connecting on port 843.",
  "sources": "The server reads incoming TCP connection requests on the specified listener address (default 0.0.0.0:843).",
  "sinks": "The socket.sendall method is used to send the policy XML to clients; print statements may output connection info.",
  "flows": "Incoming connections (source) trigger handle method, which sends the policy XML (sink) over the socket.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscated code or unusual behaviors. No hardcoded credentials besides the policy XML are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server class inheriting from gevent's StreamServer. It serves a fixed cross-domain policy XML upon connection, which is standard for Flash apps needing cross-origin access. The constructor defaults to port 843, common for such policy servers. The handle method outputs connection info if noisy, then sends the policy XML. No external inputs, user data, or malicious code is present. The use of a standard policy XML and simple socket communication is benign. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic implementation of a Flash policy server, serving a standard XML policy. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
