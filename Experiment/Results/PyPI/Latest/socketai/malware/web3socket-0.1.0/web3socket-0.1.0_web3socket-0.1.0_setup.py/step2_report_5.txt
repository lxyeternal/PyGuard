  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a standard setup script, reading version info via regex, no malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence is high (0.9), and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores seem reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also describes a typical setup script, with similar observations.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), possibly due to regex parsing, but this is standard.\n- Malware score: 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar findings, emphasizing the standard nature of the script.\n- Malware score: 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- Confidence is even higher (1.0).\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores seem justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, a typical setup script with standard regex version extraction.\n- Malware score: 0, appropriate.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2), but still not indicating malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, standard setup process.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.0.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Python package setup script.\n- No evidence of malicious code, malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The regex used to extract the version is typical, with no signs of malicious manipulation.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly low) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly at 0.\n- The securityRisk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n- Confidence levels are justified given the straightforward, standard code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (since the regex parsing could theoretically be manipulated if the source file is compromised, but this is a standard practice and not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
