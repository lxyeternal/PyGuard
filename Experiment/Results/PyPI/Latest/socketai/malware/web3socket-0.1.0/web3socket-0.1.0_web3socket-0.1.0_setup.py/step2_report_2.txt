  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**1. Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script; no malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, reading version info via regex, then calling setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, aligns with the code.\n\n**2. Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practice, no external input influencing behavior, minimal risk.\n- **Assessment:** The regex-based version extraction is typical; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — slightly above zero, justified by minimal potential risk if the source file is compromised, but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent.\n\n**3. Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup script, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code is minimal, standard, and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**4. Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup script, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The regex extraction could be manipulated if the source file is compromised, but this is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — slightly higher, justified by the potential if the source file is tampered with, but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**5. Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—benign setup script.\n- **Assessment:** No dynamic or malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.0 to 0.2). The minor risk scores are justified given the regex pattern could be manipulated if the source file is compromised, but this is a standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is a typical setup script with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior.\n- The regex pattern, while simple, is standard and not suspicious.\n- No external data, user input, or network activity occurs.\n- The version extraction could be a point of concern if the source file is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (confirmed benign)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (acceptable minimal risk due to potential source file tampering, but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's behavior. The minor risk score (0.1) is justified but could be lowered to 0 if desired, considering the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n**Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores I recommend:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or 0 if considering the standard nature of setup scripts and assuming source file integrity)\n\nThis careful review confirms the code's safety and the appropriateness of the reported scores.",
