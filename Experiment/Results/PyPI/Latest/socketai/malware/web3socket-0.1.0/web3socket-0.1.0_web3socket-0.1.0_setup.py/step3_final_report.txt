  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the web3socket Python module, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file output based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads version from source file; passes metadata to setup() without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex for version extraction, which could be manipulated if source file is compromised, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script. It imports setup functions, extracts version info via regex, and calls setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The regex-based version extraction is common but could be a point of concern if the source file is tampered with. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), justified by the reliance on source file content but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign Python package setup file with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects the potential if the source file is compromised, but this is typical and not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
