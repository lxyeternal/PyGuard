  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The script is a typical setup.py, reading version info via regex, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — consistent with benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup script with version extraction via regex.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to reliance on source file content, but this is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate. No malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard setup.py.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — still low, just noting potential tampering if the source file is compromised.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same standard setup script.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware:** All scores are 0, which is consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** All scores are 0, consistent.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward, conventional setup.py script for packaging a Python module.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The regex-based version extraction, while potentially vulnerable if the source file is compromised, is standard practice and not malicious.\n- The minimal security risk scores are appropriate given the context.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, mainly due to dependency on source file integrity, not malicious intent)\n\n**Overall, the package appears safe and legitimate.**",
