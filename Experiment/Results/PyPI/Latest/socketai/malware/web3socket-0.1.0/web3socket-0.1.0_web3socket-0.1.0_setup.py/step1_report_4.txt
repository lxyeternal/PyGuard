{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'web3socket' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using a regex search.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script primarily reads a file and calls setup().",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> passes data to setup() without further manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version info; potential risk if the version string is manipulated externally, but not malicious by itself. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup process for a Python package, importing necessary modules, retrieving the version string via regex, and calling setup() with package metadata. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The version extraction method is common but could be problematic if the '__init__.py' file is tampered with, yet this does not constitute malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, no hidden or suspicious logic, and no evidence of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It securely reads version info from the package and proceeds with configuration as expected.",
