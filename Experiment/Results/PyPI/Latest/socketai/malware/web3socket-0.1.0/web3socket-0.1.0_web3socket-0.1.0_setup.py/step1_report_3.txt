{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'web3socket' by reading its version from the package's __init__.py and invoking setup() to package and distribute the module.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' file.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; the setup() call configures package metadata only.",
  "flows": "The version string extracted from the file flows directly into the setup() function as the package version.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a regex to extract version info, which is straightforward; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup operation. It attempts to import setuptools and falls back to distutils if unavailable. It extracts the version string from a specific file, which is a common practice. The setup() function is called with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code is minimal, clean, and standard for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads version info and calls setup(), both of which are safe. There are no anomalies, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
