  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket-based chat application with static file serving and basic broadcasting capabilities.",
  "sources": "environ['web3socket'], environ['PATH_INFO'], open(path), socket.receive(), socket.getpeername()",
  "sinks": "socket.send(), print message, broadcast to users",
  "flows": "environ['web3socket'] or PATH_INFO -> handle_web3socket or serve static files -> broadcast messages to sockets",
  "anomalies": "The code uses print for message output, but no other anomalies like hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are apparent. The socket session ID is generated from peername, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a WebSocket server handling message broadcasting and static file serving. The 'web3socket' environment variable is used to identify WebSocket connections. There is no evidence of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity. The server reads static files and replaces a placeholder '$PORT' with a fixed port number, which appears safe. The socket handling includes a continuous receive loop that could be exploited if socket.receive() yields malicious input, but no code injection or malicious commands are evident. The broadcast function prints messages, which could be considered information leakage if logs are exposed but is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code performs typical WebSocket chat functionality without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic WebSocket chat server with static file serving. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It appears safe from supply chain attacks or malicious sabotage based on the provided code.",
