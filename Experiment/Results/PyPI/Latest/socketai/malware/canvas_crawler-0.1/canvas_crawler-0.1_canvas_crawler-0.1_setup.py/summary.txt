  "conclusion": "The code performs a covert system info transmission during installation, raising privacy concerns but lacking malicious payloads or sabotage. It is not malware, but its privacy-invasive behavior warrants a moderate security risk score (~0.6). The code is straightforward and unobfuscated, with no malicious intent explicitly present. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, which correctly identify the privacy implications and assign appropriate low malware scores and moderate risk levels."
