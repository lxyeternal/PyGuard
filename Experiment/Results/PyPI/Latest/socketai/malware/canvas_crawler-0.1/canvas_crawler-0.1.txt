      "conclusion": "The code performs a covert system info transmission during installation, raising privacy concerns but lacking malicious payloads or sabotage. It is not malware, but its privacy-invasive behavior warrants a moderate security risk score (~0.6). The code is straightforward and unobfuscated, with no malicious intent explicitly present. The overall assessment aligns with the reports, which correctly identify the privacy implications and assign appropriate low malware scores and moderate risk levels."

      "conclusion": "The code performs environment tracking via silent network requests, raising privacy issues but not constituting malware. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk around 0.45. The behavior warrants caution and transparency but is not actively malicious."
