  "purpose": "To send a notification request to a specified URL containing system information when the module is imported.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (`socket.gethostname()`) and username (`getpass.getuser()`) during URL construction.",
  "sinks": "Sending an HTTP GET request to an external URL (`requests.get(CANARYTOKEN_URL)`) with embedded system info.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a URL with system data and then triggers an HTTP GET request to that URL immediately upon import, potentially leaking system details.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of a hardcoded external URL with system data suggests tracking. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved; the request is silently ignored on failure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a URL with embedded system details (hostname, username, package name) and sends an HTTP GET request to this URL immediately upon module import. This acts as a form of tracking or 'canary' alert, notifying a remote server of the environment where the package is used. The request fails silently, avoiding errors but still performing an external network call. The URL indicates use of canary tokens, often employed in security testing or tracking. There is no malicious payload or data exfiltration beyond the system info in the request, but the behavior raises privacy and security concerns, especially if used without user knowledge. No obfuscated code or malicious code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment tracking by sending system information to an external server via a silent HTTP request during module import. While not outright malicious, it constitutes a privacy concern and could be used for tracking without user consent. It does not contain malware but exhibits potentially unwanted tracking behavior.",
