{
  "purpose": "The code sends a notification to a specified URL containing system information when the module is imported, likely for tracking or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname via socket.gethostname() and current username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Sends an HTTP GET request to the CANARYTOKEN_URL, transmitting system info over the network.",
  "flows": "The data collected (hostname and username) is embedded into the URL and sent through requests.get().",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded URL that points to a third-party domain (canarytokens.com) for tracking. The purpose appears to be clandestine monitoring, as the function silently fails without alerting the user.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a URL with embedded system information, likely for tracking purposes. The notify() function executes immediately upon import, sending an HTTP request to an external domain without explicit user consent or notification. The silent exception handling prevents detection of failures. This behavior resembles a form of tracking or stealth monitoring, which could be considered malicious depending on context. There are no malicious payloads or destructive actions, but the privacy-invading behavior is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code covertly transmits system information to an external service upon import, which could be used for user tracking or stealth monitoring. While it does not perform destructive actions, its privacy-intrusive nature and the use of a third-party URL suggest potentially malicious or undesirable behavior.",
