{
  "purpose": "To silently report environment information (hostname, username, package name) to an external URL upon module import, potentially for tracking or fingerprinting purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get(CANARYTOKEN_URL)",
  "flows": "socket.gethostname() and getpass.getuser() generate data -> URL constructed with these values -> requests.get() sends data to external server",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling in notify(), no user notification, straightforward URL with system info, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL embedding system info and makes an HTTP GET request immediately upon import, acting as a stealthy tracker. It does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or destructive actions. The behavior is privacy-invading but not malware. The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation. The network request is silent and silently fails on exceptions. The privacy concern is significant, but there is no active malicious activity or payload. The malware score should be low (0), reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score should be moderate (~0.45), considering stealthy environment fingerprinting without user consent. The confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment tracking via silent network requests, raising privacy issues but not constituting malware. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk around 0.45. The behavior warrants caution and transparency but is not actively malicious.",
