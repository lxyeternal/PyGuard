  "purpose": "Display aesthetic banners and flags for celebration using terminal size and styling functions.",
  "sources": "get_terminal_size(), sleep(), styling functions (colored, bold)",
  "sinks": "print() statements for styled terminal output",
  "flows": "Terminal size influences layout; sleep delays for animation effects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious code; use of sleep for animation is benign",
  "analysis": "The code solely creates styled ASCII art banners and messages for aesthetic purposes. It reads terminal size to adapt display, uses sleep() for animation delays, and styling functions presumed safe. No external data, network activity, or untrusted input is involved. The styling functions are assumed benign. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The use of sleep delays does not introduce security vulnerabilities but could be considered a minor UX concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving purely aesthetic terminal display functions. There is no malicious behavior, no security vulnerabilities, and no obfuscation. The minor use of sleep delays for animation does not constitute a security risk.",
