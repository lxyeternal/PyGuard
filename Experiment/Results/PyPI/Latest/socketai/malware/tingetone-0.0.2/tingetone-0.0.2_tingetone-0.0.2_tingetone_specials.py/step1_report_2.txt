{
  "purpose": "The code displays a decorative banner and a flag with styled text, likely for aesthetic or branding purposes in a terminal application.",
  "sources": "The code reads terminal size via get_terminal_size(), and uses input data indirectly through terminal behavior; it also imports modules 'colored' and 'bold' for styling, which are presumed to be local or external styling utilities.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data for critical operations are present. The only outputs are styled print statements for UI display.",
  "flows": "The flow reads terminal size (source), then prints styled output (sink), with no data transformation or external data processing beyond display functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed. The styling functions 'colored' and 'bold' are presumed to be benign UI utilities; the code includes sleep delays for animation but no suspicious network activity or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides terminal UI effects, such as a flag and banner with styled text, using terminal size detection and sleep delays for animation. It imports styling functions which are presumed to be local or third-party libraries. No external network calls, file manipulations, or secret data handling are present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. The only potentially concerning aspect might be the use of sleep delays, but these are typical for animation effects and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely aesthetic, designed to display a stylized banner and flag in the terminal. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are detected. It is safe from a security perspective.",
