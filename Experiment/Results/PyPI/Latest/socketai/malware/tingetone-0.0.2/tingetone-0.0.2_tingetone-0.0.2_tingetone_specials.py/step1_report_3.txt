  "flows": "Terminal size data is used to format the display text; no data from external or untrusted sources is used beyond terminal size.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code; no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on terminal display with dynamic text based on terminal size. It uses standard library functions and simple string formatting. No input from untrusted sources, no external network calls, no data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns detected. Sleep functions are used for visual effects but do not impact security. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for aesthetic display purposes only. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment.",
