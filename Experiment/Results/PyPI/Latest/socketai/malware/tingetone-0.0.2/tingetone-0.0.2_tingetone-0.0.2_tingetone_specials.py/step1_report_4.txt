{
  "purpose": "The code displays a decorative flag and a banner message in the terminal, likely for branding or user interaction purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads terminal size using get_terminal_size() and outputs text to the terminal via print(). No untrusted input sources are detected.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output (console), which is benign. No data leakage, network, or file system sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The functions get terminal size -> print styled banners and messages to the terminal. No data flows to insecure sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The sleep delays are benign and used for visual effects. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard library functions for terminal size detection and outputs styled text for visual banners. It includes no network activity, file manipulation, or dynamic code execution. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of sleep for animation effects, which is typical for terminal banners. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for displaying styled banners and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use.",
