  "purpose": "The code displays visual banners and messages in the terminal, likely for branding or user engagement.",
  "sources": "Reads terminal size via get_terminal_size(), and user environment for terminal display.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output to the terminal; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input (terminal size) influences display formatting; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard library functions to determine terminal size and display formatted messages. No external network connections, no data collection, no code injection, or suspicious activities detected. The functions are straightforward, with clear intent and no malicious payloads. It’s purely for aesthetic terminal output. No use of untrusted inputs beyond environment queries, which are benign here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for aesthetic terminal display with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any external data transfer, nor does it contain backdoors or malicious payloads. The overall security risk is minimal.",
