{
  "purpose": "The code displays visual banners and messages in the terminal, including a flag design and a thank you message.",
  "sources": "get_terminal_size() to determine terminal dimensions; sleep() for timing delays; print() for output; imported functions 'colored' and 'bold' for styling text.",
  "sinks": "print() statements outputting styled and centered text; no untrusted data sinks or external data interactions present.",
  "flows": "Terminal size retrieval (source) influences formatting and layout of output (sink); sleep() delays are internal and not influencing external data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sleep() for animated display; reliance on terminal size with fallback; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed; styling functions imported but not inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages terminal display formatting and animated text output. It uses 'get_terminal_size()' to adapt the display layout and 'sleep()' for animation timing. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network interactions, and no code that performs data theft or system manipulation. The styling functions 'colored' and 'bold' are assumed to be benign text styling utilities. Overall, the code's behavior is purely cosmetic, designed for user interface enhancement, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely for displaying styled ASCII art and messages in the terminal. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a benign aesthetic script with no security concerns.",
