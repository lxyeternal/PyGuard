  "security_risk": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,

  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to remote code fetching, execution, self-deletion, and obfuscation techniques. The behavior aligns with malware patterns, warranting a high malware score of 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The obfuscation score of 0.7 reflects moderate obfuscation. Overall, the code should be considered highly malicious and dangerous in supply chain contexts."
