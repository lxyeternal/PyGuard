  "purpose": "Utility module providing ANSI escape sequences for terminal text coloring and an exception class for invalid colors.",
  "sources": "The dictionaries 'COLORS' and 'ON_COLORS' read color names and map them to ANSI escape codes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or input handling present; the code only defines constants and a class.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process or flow data from sources to sinks; it only defines static mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static dictionaries for foreground and background colors using ANSI escape sequences, along with an exception class. There are no dynamic inputs, external dependencies, or suspicious constructs. The code is simple, readable, and standard for terminal coloring utilities. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The reports provided are empty, indicating no identified issues or concerns. Given the lack of evidence or suspicious activity, the code is benign, and the scores should reflect that.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal coloring with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The empty reports do not indicate any security issues. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
