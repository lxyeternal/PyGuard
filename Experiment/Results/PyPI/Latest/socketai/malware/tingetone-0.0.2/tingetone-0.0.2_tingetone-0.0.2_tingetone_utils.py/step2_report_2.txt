  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code provided is a straightforward utility module defining color constants and an exception class. There are no apparent vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation present. The code appears to be standard and functional.\n\n2. **Review of the reports:**  \n   All reports are marked as \"Empty response\" with no additional details. This suggests that no specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activities have been reported or identified in the code.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   Since the reports contain no content, there's no reasoning or claims to evaluate. They are essentially placeholders with no substantive information.\n\n4. **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n   - Malware score: Given the absence of any malicious activity or suspicious code, the malware score should be very low or zero.  \n   - Obfuscated score: The code is clear and readable; there's no obfuscation.  \n   - Risk score: Without any reported issues or suspicious activity, the risk score should also be minimal.\n\n5. **Potential claims based on assumptions:**  \n   Since no claims are made, there's nothing to challenge. The absence of evidence means we should not assume any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   As no issues are identified, the scores should reflect a clean, benign status.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no malicious activity detected or claimed)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, default low risk, since no issues are reported)\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are empty; therefore, there are no issues to escalate or investigate. The code appears safe, clean, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo further action needed based on current reports. If new information arises, reassessment should be performed.",
