  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content during package setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and uses standard setuptools functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, defines a version string, and calls setup() with package metadata, including reading the long description from a file. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden functions. The usage of standard library functions and straightforward setup parameters indicates a typical package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security issues.",
