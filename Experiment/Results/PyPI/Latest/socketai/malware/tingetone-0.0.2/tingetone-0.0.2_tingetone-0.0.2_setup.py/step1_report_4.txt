  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for publishing the 'tingetone' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content and pass it to the setup() function as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without try-except may raise exceptions if 'README.md' is missing; no malicious code or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package, importing 'setuptools', defining package metadata, and reading the README file for description. No input/output from untrusted sources beyond reading a local file. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior identified. The code appears straightforward and conventional for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It reads a local file and defines package metadata, which is standard practice.",
