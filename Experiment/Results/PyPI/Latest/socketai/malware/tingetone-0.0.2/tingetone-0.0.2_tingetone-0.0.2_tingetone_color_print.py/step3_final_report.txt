  "purpose": "Provides terminal styling functions such as colored, bold, italic, underline, and styled messages for terminal output.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to functions (text, color, on_color); platform.system() check; get_terminal_size()",
  "sinks": "print() statements for output; no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> validation -> ANSI escape codes -> terminal output",
  "anomalies": "The call to system('') on Windows, which is a no-op and appears redundant",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward terminal styling utility with functions for colored and styled text output. It validates color inputs against predefined dictionaries and raises exceptions for invalid colors. The only system call, system(''), on Windows is harmless and likely a placeholder. No external data processing, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign terminal styling utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The system('') call is harmless but unnecessary. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for use.",
