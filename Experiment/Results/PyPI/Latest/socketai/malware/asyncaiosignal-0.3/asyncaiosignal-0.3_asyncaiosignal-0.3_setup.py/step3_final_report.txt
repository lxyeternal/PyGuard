  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package named 'asyncaiosignal', defining dependencies and package discovery.",
  "sources": "The import of setuptools and the call to setup() with fixed dependencies and find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or code execution points; dependencies are fixed and standard.",
  "flows": "Import setuptools -> call setup() -> install specified dependencies and packages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with explicit, fixed dependencies and package discovery. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation present. All dependencies are reputable packages with no signs of malicious intent. The structure is straightforward, and the code does not perform any operations beyond package setup. The consistent reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the static and standard nature of the script, the overall assessment aligns with a very low security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The dependency list is standard and fixed, and the code structure is straightforward. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
