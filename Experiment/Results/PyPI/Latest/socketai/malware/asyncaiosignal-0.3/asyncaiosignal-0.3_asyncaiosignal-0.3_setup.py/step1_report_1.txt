{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'asyncaiosignal', defining dependencies and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies from 'install_requires' list, uses 'find_packages()' to locate package modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; potential concern if dependencies or setup involve remote code execution or malicious modules.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script installs dependencies but does not execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed. The dependencies seem standard for a Python project.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package info and dependencies. All listed dependencies are common and appear legitimate. No code execution, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The setup process is straightforward and typical.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It simply defines package dependencies and configuration.",
