{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'asyncaiosignal', specifying dependencies and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Input data: static list of dependencies and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; no untrusted input handling, no data leaks, or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; dependencies are listed statically and do not involve runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures present. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package info and static dependencies. No runtime input, dynamic code execution, or network interactions are present. The dependencies are fixed versions, and there is no indication of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and typical for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security issues. All dependencies and functions are used as intended for package configuration.",
