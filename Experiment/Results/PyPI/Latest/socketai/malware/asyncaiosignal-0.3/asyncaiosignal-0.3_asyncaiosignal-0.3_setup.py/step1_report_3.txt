{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'asyncaiosignal', specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'install_requires' list and uses 'find_packages()' to determine package contents.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are statically specified, and package discovery is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The dependencies listed are standard packages without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to configure package setup, including specifying dependencies with exact versions. No dynamic code execution, environment variable usage, or network activity is present. The dependencies are common libraries with no indication of malicious intent. The code structure and format are typical for a setup.py file, with no signs of obfuscation or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages dependencies and package metadata without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
