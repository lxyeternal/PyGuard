  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate anti-analysis environment protector employing standard techniques. It does not contain malicious payloads or behaviors. The current malware score overstates the threat; it should be set to 0. The obfuscation score can be slightly increased due to dynamic URL generation but remains low. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is not malicious."
