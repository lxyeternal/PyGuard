  "conclusion": "The code is unequivocally malicious malware, functioning as a keylogger and data exfiltration tool. It uses embedded credentials, stealth techniques, and active data collection to operate covertly. The high presence of malicious indicators justifies maximum malware and security risk scores. It should be classified as high-severity malware with potential for significant privacy invasion and data theft."
