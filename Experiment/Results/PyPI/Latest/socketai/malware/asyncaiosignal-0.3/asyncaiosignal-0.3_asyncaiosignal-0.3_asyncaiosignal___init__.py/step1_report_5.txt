{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that imports specific classes and enumerations from internal modules for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or external data handling present",
  "flows": "Imports suggest internal flow of data between modules, but no explicit source-to-sink data flow is shown in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and enums from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. It is standard for package organization. No external input handling, no suspicious functions, no cryptic code. The code's simplicity and structure do not indicate malicious intent. It relies on internal modules, which are not shown, but their naming suggests typical functionality without signs of malicious code. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import statement typical for Python packages, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this fragment.",
