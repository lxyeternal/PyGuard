{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enums from local files for use elsewhere in the project, likely related to data processing or computational tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow detected within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward module import/export pattern with no apparent anomalies or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and enums from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, standard practice for modular Python packages. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is minimal and structurally normal, serving as an interface or API layer without performing any logic or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple, benign module declaration and import statement, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
