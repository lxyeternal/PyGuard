{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enums from internal submodules for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are visible in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows or data handling paths are present in the code snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only straightforward import statements and an __all__ declaration; no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and serves as an import interface for other modules, defining what is publicly accessible via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute dynamic code. The import statements reference internal modules, which could be checked separately, but within this snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not read or write untrusted data, nor does it contain suspicious code. It appears benign and intended solely for modular code organization.",
