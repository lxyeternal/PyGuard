{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface, importing classes and enums from internal modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports internal modules (.ms, .enums, .utils).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only establishes namespace exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration, indicating a simple module interface. No network, file, or environment operations are present. The internal modules are not provided, but their naming suggests standard functionality. All reviews agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is a typical pattern for Python package modules, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports and scores are consistent with this assessment. No modifications are necessary.",
