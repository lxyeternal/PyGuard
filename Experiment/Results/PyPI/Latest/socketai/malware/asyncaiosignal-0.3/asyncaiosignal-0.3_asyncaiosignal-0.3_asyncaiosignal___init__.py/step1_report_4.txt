{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various classes and enums from local submodules and exposes them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, network operations, or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or unusual code behaviors observed; straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code only performs static import operations from relative modules and defines __all__ for exports. No data input handling, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that imports and exports classes and enums, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
