{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import and export module, exposing specific classes and enums for use in other parts of a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms (Compute, KL), .enums (Senders, Features, Utils, Protectors), .utils (Loader, Grabber). These are internal source references, not external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data outputs are present in this snippet. No network, file, or environment interactions occur here.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this module. It only re-exports classes and enums.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution are present. The code is straightforward module re-exporting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from sibling modules and defines __all__ for export. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no network or system calls, nor any dynamic code execution. It appears as a simple interface aggregator. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module for organizing imports and exports, with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. It does not contain any harmful logic or obfuscated code. It is safe based on the provided content.",
