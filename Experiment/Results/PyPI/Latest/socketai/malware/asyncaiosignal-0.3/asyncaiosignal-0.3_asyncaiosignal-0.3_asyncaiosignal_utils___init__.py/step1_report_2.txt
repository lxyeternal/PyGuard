  "purpose": "The code exports specific classes from local modules for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .autostart, .message, .loader, .protector, .grabber",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external network, file, or environment variable access observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; purely re-exporting classes",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns; straightforward import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes from sibling modules and defines __all__ for exports. There are no function calls, data processing, or external interactions. It does not contain any embedded or obfuscated code. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module re-export pattern with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
