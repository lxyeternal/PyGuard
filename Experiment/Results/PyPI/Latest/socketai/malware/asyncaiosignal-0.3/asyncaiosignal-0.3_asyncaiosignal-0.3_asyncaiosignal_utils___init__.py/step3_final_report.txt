  "purpose": "Module exports for a Python package, organizing class imports for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sibling modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; static import/export pattern.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static class imports and __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static module initializer, importing classes from local modules and defining __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The malware scores are appropriately zero; the security risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the code. Confidence levels are high (mostly 1). The slight elevation of security risk to 0.1 in some reports appears overcautious given the simplicity of the code, and should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module export pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action is necessary unless imported modules are found to contain malicious code.",
