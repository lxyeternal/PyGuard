{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a package, importing specific classes from local modules to expose them publicly.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code only handles module imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules into the exported __all__ list, with no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs; straightforward module import/export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from sibling modules and assigns them to __all__ for public API exposure. There is no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or external network interactions. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module index file. Given the simplicity and lack of active logic, there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initialization file with no malicious or security concerns. It simply exposes certain classes for external use, with no suspicious activities present.",
