  "purpose": "This code defines and exports a set of classes related to autostart, messaging, loading, protection, and grabbing functionalities, likely for a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted data or cause data leaks directly within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are present in this code; it merely imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are observable in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs module imports and defines an export list. It does not execute any runtime logic, handle input, or perform actions that could be malicious. Without additional context or implementation details within the imported modules, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module export setup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger project, and the security of the entire project would depend on the contents of the imported modules.",
