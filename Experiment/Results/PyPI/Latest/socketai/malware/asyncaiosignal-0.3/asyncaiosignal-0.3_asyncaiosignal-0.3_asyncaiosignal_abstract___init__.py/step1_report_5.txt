  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public interface for a module by importing and exposing the AbstractSender class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code fragment",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are evident within this small snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected in this minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named AbstractSender from a local sender module and sets __all__ to make it publicly accessible. The code is straightforward and does not include any runtime data handling, external data sources, or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The snippet is typical for Python modules to define exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
