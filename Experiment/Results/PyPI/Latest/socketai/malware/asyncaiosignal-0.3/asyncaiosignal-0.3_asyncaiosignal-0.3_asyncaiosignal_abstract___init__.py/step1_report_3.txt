  "purpose": "This code defines the public interface of a module by importing and exposing AbstractSender.",
  "sources": "The code imports AbstractSender from a relative module 'sender'. No input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present; the code only performs an import and export statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class named AbstractSender from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__. It is a common pattern in Python for module API management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The snippet is very small and lacks any dynamic or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign and standard for defining module exports. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
