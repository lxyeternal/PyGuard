{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python module that imports 'AbstractSender' from a local 'sender' module and exposes it via '__all__' for public API purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement from the local 'sender' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external interactions.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no data flows or untrusted data paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward module export pattern with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It imports a class and exposes it via '__all__', a common Python pattern. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module export pattern with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
