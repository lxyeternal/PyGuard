{
  "purpose": "The code exports an AbstractSender class from a local sender module, likely for use as a base class in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module './sender'",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flows; code only defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only importing and exporting a class name. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no potentially dangerous operations. The import path suggests a local module, not external network or file access. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no apparent malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module export statement with no malicious behavior or security issues identified. It simply exposes a class for external use.",
