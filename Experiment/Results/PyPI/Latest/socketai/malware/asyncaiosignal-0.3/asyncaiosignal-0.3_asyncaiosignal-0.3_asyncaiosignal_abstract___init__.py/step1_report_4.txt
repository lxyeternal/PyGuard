  "purpose": "The code appears to define the public interface of a module by importing and exposing the AbstractSender class.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not include any suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module and declares it as part of the public API. No data input, output, or execution of untrusted code is present. The structure indicates standard Python package practices without any obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical module export pattern with no signs of malicious intent.",
