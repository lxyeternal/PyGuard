{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package a Python project named 'ignore-ssl', including its dependencies and description.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package requirements from the 'install_requires' list and the long description from the 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the script does not process untrusted data or execute commands based on external input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static declarations ('install_requires' and 'long_description') into the setup process; no dynamic or untrusted data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' modules to configure package distribution. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and reads the long description from a markdown file. The process appears straightforward and typical for Python package setup. No indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident. The only potential concern could be if 'README.md' contains malicious content, but that is external to this code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on the provided code. It solely facilitates package building and distribution.",
