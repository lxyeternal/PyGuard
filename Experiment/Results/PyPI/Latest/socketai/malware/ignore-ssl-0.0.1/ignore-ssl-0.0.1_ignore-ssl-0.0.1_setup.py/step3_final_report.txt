  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processed or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is typical for package distribution with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated logic. The only external operation is reading 'README.md', which is standard practice. The package name 'ignore-ssl' does not imply malicious behavior, and the dependency 'requests' is included but not used here. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
