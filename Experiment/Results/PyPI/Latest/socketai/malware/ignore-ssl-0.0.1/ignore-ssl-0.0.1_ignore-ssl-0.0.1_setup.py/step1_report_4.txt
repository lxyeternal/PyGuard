{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'ignore-ssl'.",
  "sources": "The script reads the package name, version, package list, dependencies ('requests'), and the contents of 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reading from 'README.md' file; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'README.md' file into 'long_description' for package metadata; dependencies are specified but not executed here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. Use of 'find_packages()' and 'requests' is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup configuration for a Python package. It reads static package information and dependencies, with no user input or network activity shown. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The presence of 'requests' dependency alone is common, and the code does not invoke it or perform any network operations here. The only potential concern is reading 'README.md' without validation, but this is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and is a standard package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this code snippet.",
