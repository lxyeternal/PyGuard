  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python project named 'ignore-ssl'.",
  "sources": "The code reads 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' → uses its content as long_description during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup.py structure with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads a README.md file to include a long description, which is common practice. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or credential handling. The package is named 'ignore-ssl' but that is not inherently suspicious; no evidence of malicious intent in the code itself. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to configure package installation details.",
