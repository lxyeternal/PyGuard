  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It defines package name, version, dependencies (`requests`), and reads `README.md` for long description.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code.\n- The package name `ignore-ssl` might suggest some SSL handling, but the code itself does not implement or modify SSL behavior.\n- External factors (like the content of `README.md`) are outside the scope of this code review.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports conclude that the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious behavior, which aligns with the code provided.\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes:\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify the code as a typical setup script with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score (all reports):** 0 or 0. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1 for reading `README.md`. This is a very minor concern, but reading a file isn't inherently risky unless the content is malicious. Since the code does not process or execute the content, the risk remains negligible.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The package name `ignore-ssl` could imply some SSL bypass or modification, but **nothing in the code suggests any SSL handling or network interception**.\n- The dependency `requests` is included but not used here; its presence alone is not suspicious.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate: **the code is benign**.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nBased on the code and the reports, I would assign the following scores:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.05, but 0 is acceptable)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and their scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus that the code is benign and typical for its purpose.",
