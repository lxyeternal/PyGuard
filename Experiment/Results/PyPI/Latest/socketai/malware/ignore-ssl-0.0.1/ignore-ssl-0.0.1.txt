      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration of sensitive SSL keys or configuration data. The obfuscation, external communication, and handling of sensitive files strongly suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. The pattern warrants further investigation and possibly immediate review or removal from production environments."
