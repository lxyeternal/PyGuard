  "purpose": "To decode base64-encoded SSL configuration data and send it via an HTTP POST request to a decoded URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment data from a file path derived from a base64-decoded string stored in 'ssl_key'.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data over the network to a URL obtained from decoding 'base_ssl_cert'.",
  "flows": "The code decodes 'base_ssl_key' to get a file path, reads the file content, decodes 'base_ssl_cert' to get a URL, and sends the file content via POST request to that URL.",
  "anomalies": "Uses base64-encoded strings to obfuscate URLs and file paths, which can hide malicious intent. It reads a file whose path is derived from a decoded string, potentially accessing sensitive data. The network request is made without validation of the server or data, and there is no verification of the URL or file content, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string intended as a URL ('base_ssl_cert') and a file path ('base_ssl_key'). It checks for the existence of the decoded path, then reads its content if present. It sends this content via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL with specific headers. The obfuscation using base64 and dynamic file access suggests an intent to conceal network communication and file operations. The code could potentially exfiltrate data or connect to a malicious server, especially given the lack of validation or restrictions.",
  "conclusion": "The script employs obfuscation techniques to decode a URL and file path, then reads potentially sensitive data from a file and posts it to a remote server. This pattern is characteristic of malicious or covert operations, such as data exfiltration. The lack of validation and reliance on decoded data makes it suspicious for malicious intent.",
