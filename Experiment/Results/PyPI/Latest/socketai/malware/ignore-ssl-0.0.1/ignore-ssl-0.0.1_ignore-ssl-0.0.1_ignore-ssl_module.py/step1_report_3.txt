  "purpose": "This code appears to decode base64-encoded strings representing SSL certificate and key paths, then attempts to read a file from the decoded key path and send its contents to a URL decoded from the base64-encoded string.",
  "sources": "os.path.exists(ssl_key), open(ssl_key, 'r'), requests.post(ssl_cert, data=config_content)",
  "sinks": "requests.post to a URL decoded from base64-encoded string, printing to stdout",
  "flows": "Decode base64 strings -> check if file exists at decoded path -> read file content -> send content via POST request to decoded URL",
  "anomalies": "The code decodes a URL from base64 and sends file contents to that URL, which could be a data exfiltration mechanism. The SSL cert and key are stored as base64 strings, which is unusual for configuration data. The use of dynamic URL and file reading suggests potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes base64 strings that appear to be a URL and a file path. It then checks for the existence of the file at the decoded path, reads the file content if present, and sends this data via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL. The URL is obfuscated through base64 encoding, and the file path is also encoded, which suggests an attempt to hide the data flow. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or remote command execution tactics often used by malware. The process of reading a file specified by a decoded path and transmitting its contents without any validation or encryption is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code's behavior indicates potential malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration via sending file contents to an external URL decoded from base64. The obfuscation and lack of validation contribute to a high suspicion of malicious intent.",
