  "purpose": "Decode base64-encoded SSL certificate and key paths, read the key file, and send its contents to a remote server via POST request.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded strings decoded to obtain URL and file path; file existence check; file read operation.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the decoded URL with the file content as data.",
  "flows": "Decode base64 strings -> check if file exists -> read file content -> send POST request with content.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for URL and file path; transmitting potentially sensitive SSL key data externally; lack of validation or sanitization; obfuscated strings.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes obfuscated strings to obtain a URL and a file path, checks for the file's existence, reads its content, and posts this data to the decoded URL. The use of base64 encoding for critical strings suggests obfuscation. The transmission of the SSL key file content to an external server without validation or encryption raises suspicion of data exfiltration. The pattern aligns with malicious behaviors such as covert data transfer or backdoor activity. The code does not perform any validation, error handling is minimal, and it handles sensitive data, increasing the potential for malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration of sensitive SSL keys or configuration data. The obfuscation, external communication, and handling of sensitive files strongly suggest malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. The pattern warrants further investigation and possibly immediate review or removal from production environments.",
