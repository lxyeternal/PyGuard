  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet and reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code appears benign, with low security risk. The scores are appropriate; the main uncertainty hinges on the internal implementation of 'ssl_config()'. Further review of that function is recommended if security concerns are high."
