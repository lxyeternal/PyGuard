  "purpose": "Import and invoke the ssl_config function from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .module import ssl_config.",
  "sinks": "Calling ssl_config() may be a sink if it performs sensitive actions or network operations.",
  "flows": "The imported function ssl_config() is invoked immediately after import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named ssl_config from a local module and executes it. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no visible malicious intent. Without access to the implementation of ssl_config(), it is impossible to determine if it performs malicious activities such as network connections or data exfiltration. The minimal structure suggests typical usage, but the true behavior depends on the imported function's internal code. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are detected at this level.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import and execution of a function, with no apparent malicious behavior or anomalies. The security risk is low; however, the actual safety depends on the implementation of ssl_config(), which is not visible here.",
