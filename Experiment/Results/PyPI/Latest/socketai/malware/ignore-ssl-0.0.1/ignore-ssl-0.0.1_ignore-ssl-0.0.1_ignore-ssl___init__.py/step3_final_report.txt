{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes an SSL configuration function from a local module, likely for setting up SSL parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the function call may configure SSL settings internally.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: import 'ssl_config' and invoke it; actual behavior depends on 'ssl_config()' implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are visible in this minimal snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and standard for SSL setup; without the implementation of 'ssl_config()', no definitive malicious behavior can be determined. The reports correctly identify that the behavior depends on the internal implementation. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns. Confidence levels vary but are generally appropriate given the unknown internal behavior. No logical flaws or errors are evident in the reports. The risk remains low unless 'ssl_config()' performs insecure or malicious actions, which cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet and reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code appears benign, with low security risk. The scores are appropriate; the main uncertainty hinges on the internal implementation of 'ssl_config()'. Further review of that function is recommended if security concerns are high.",
