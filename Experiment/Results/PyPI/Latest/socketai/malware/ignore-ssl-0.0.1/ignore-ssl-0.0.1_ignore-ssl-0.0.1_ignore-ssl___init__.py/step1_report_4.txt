{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named ssl_config from a local module and then calls it, likely to configure SSL settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.module' and executes the imported ssl_config() function.",
  "sinks": "The call to ssl_config() could potentially affect system or network security if the function performs unsafe SSL configuration, but the code itself does not show direct data leakage or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: import ssl_config from local module, then execute ssl_config(). No data flows are evident in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable point is the invocation of ssl_config(), which could be benign or malicious depending on its implementation. No other anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module component and executes a configuration function. Since the actual implementation of ssl_config() is not provided, the risk depends on what that function does. The code itself appears minimal and structurally simple, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. Without the implementation details, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues directly attributable to this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import and function call with no clear malicious intent. Its security risk depends entirely on the behavior of ssl_config(), which is not shown. There are no signs of malware or malicious activity within this fragment.",
