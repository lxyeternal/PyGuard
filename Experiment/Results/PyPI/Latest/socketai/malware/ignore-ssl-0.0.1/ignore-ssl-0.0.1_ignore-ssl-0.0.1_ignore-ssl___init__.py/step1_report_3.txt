{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named ssl_config from a local module and executes it, likely to configure SSL settings.",
  "sources": "The source is the local module import 'from .module import ssl_config'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'ssl_config()' could potentially modify SSL configurations, but no external data sources or untrusted inputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Import of 'ssl_config' from local module -> execution of 'ssl_config()' function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no external data handling. There are no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports and runs a function named 'ssl_config' from a local module. Without additional context, it's likely intended to set up SSL configurations, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious data flows. The minimal nature reduces suspicion, and no external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, performing a straightforward SSL configuration setup via a local module. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
