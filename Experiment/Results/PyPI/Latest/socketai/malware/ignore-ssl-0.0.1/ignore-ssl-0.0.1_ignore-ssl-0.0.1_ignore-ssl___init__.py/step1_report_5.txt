{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function called ssl_config from a local module and executes it, likely to configure SSL settings.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; execution of ssl_config() function",
  "sinks": "Potential execution within ssl_config() could be a sink if it performs sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Import of ssl_config -> execution of ssl_config() function",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and executes it. Without the implementation of ssl_config(), it's unclear what actions it performs. The naming suggests SSL configuration, which could involve setting up SSL certificates or protocols. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data leaks, or backdoors in this snippet. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns, the code appears standard. However, the actual security implications depend on the implementation of ssl_config() within the module, which is not provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a simple SSL configuration call, but full assessment depends on the ssl_config() implementation.",
