{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named ssl_config from a local module and then calls it. Its purpose appears to be configuring SSL settings, likely for secure communications.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.module', specifically importing ssl_config.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The imported ssl_config function is invoked immediately after import, indicating a straightforward source-to-sink flow within the local context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are apparent. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module's ssl_config function and executes it. Without the implementation details of ssl_config, it's impossible to determine if it performs malicious actions. The snippet itself is simple, with no suspicious logic, data leaks, or external connections shown.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to configure SSL settings via a local module, which is a common security practice. No signs of malware or security risks are present.",
