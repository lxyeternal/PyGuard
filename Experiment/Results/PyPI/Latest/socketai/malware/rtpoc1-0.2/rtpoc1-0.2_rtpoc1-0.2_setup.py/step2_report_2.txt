  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard `setup.py` script.\n- The code only reads static data from `README.md` and sets package metadata.\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- Obfuscation is correctly identified as absent (0).\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.\n- Reading `README.md` is standard practice; unless the file itself is malicious, this is safe.\n- No untrusted input handling or external data processing occurs.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n- No logical flaws or misjudgments are evident.\n\n**Note:** The reports do not mention the placeholder author info, but this is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the code content.\n- The confidence levels are all 1.0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- None necessary; the scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is entirely static, with no dynamic or malicious components, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- All reports correctly assign a risk of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Potential assumptions and claims:\n- Some reports mention reading `README.md` could be exploited if the file is maliciously replaced.\n- While theoretically possible, this is outside the scope of the setup script itself and depends on external file integrity.\n- The code does not process untrusted input or execute code based on file contents; it merely reads static data.\n\n**Conclusion:** No unwarranted assumptions lead to higher risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assessments:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical, benign `setup.py`.\n- No hidden malicious intent or obfuscation is present.\n- The placeholder author info does not affect security.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n**The code is a standard, safe packaging script with no malicious or obfuscated elements.**  \n**Scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.**",
