  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Confirms the code is a straightforward setup.py with no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard packaging script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Highlights that 'open(\"README.md\").read()' is a potential point of concern but ultimately considers it safe because it's reading static content.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Note:** Reading a static file is common; unless the file itself is malicious, this is not risky.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, no suspicious behavior, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** No dynamic or malicious behavior, standard use of setuptools.\n- **Scores:** all zero, consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign zero scores, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- **Security Risk:** No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code, no network activity, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — standard package setup, no vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n### Overall Recommendation:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, benign setup.py script used for packaging a Python project. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe packaging script with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
