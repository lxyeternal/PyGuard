  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'rtpoc1'.",
  "sources": "Reads the package description from 'README.md', and potentially user inputs if any dynamic elements were added (none in this code).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the script primarily defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted data inputs or execute any external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard use of setuptools for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata such as name, version, author, description, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads 'README.md' for long description, which is typical for package setup. No dynamic code execution, environment variable use, or untrusted data handling is present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to common setup script practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
