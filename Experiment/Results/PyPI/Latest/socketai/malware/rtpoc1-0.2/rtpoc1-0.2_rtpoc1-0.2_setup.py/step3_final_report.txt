  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script using setuptools to package a project with static metadata and README content.",
  "sources": "Reading static package metadata, author info, description, and the README.md file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or external data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from source definitions into setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads static metadata and a README file. It does not perform any dynamic operations, network activity, or code execution. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's static and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
