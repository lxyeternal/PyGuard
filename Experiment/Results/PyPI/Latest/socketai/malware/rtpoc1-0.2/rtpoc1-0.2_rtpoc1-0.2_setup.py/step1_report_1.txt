  "sources": "Reads static package metadata, author info, description, and README file content.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; primarily static data.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static data used for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup.py structure with no dynamic or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata. It reads the README.md file for long_description, which is standard. There are no user inputs, environment variable manipulations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. All dependencies are empty, and author info appears placeholder. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and contains no malicious behavior. It is a straightforward packaging configuration for a Python project.",
