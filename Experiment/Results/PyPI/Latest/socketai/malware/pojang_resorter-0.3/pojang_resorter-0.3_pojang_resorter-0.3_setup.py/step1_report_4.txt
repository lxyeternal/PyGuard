{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that, upon installation, executes a custom post-installation routine which captures a screenshot and sends it to a specified Discord webhook, then installs required dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the environment during package installation, accesses the internet via the requests library to send data to the webhook, and captures the screen using PIL's ImageGrab.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function sends a screenshot image to an external URL (webhook), which could leak user screen data without consent.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the screenshot capture (source) through the requests.post call (sink), which transmits potentially sensitive screen data to an external server (Discord webhook).",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically takes a screenshot during package installation and uploads it externally without user consent, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The use of subprocess to install packages during post-install is also atypical. No hardcoded credentials apart from the webhook URL, which is expected to be external.",
  "analysis": "The script performs an unintended or malicious action by capturing a user's screen at the moment of package installation and sending this data to an external server via a webhook, potentially violating privacy and security. The screenshot functionality is embedded directly into the post-install routine, which is not standard practice for Python packages. The code installs dependencies silently, which may be used to evade suspicion. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present; however, the behavior itself raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by capturing and transmitting a user's screenshot without explicit consent during package installation. This constitutes a privacy violation and could be used for malicious surveillance. The core risk stems from the automatic screenshot upload, making this package highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
