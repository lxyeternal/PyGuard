{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package that, upon installation, takes a screenshot and sends it to a specified Discord webhook, then installs required dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the system screen via PIL's ImageGrab, reads the package README file for long description, and reads input data via subprocess calls and the requests library.",
  "sinks": "Uploads the screenshot to an external Discord webhook URL, potentially transmitting system data over the network. Executes pip installation commands via subprocess.",
  "flows": "Screenshot data collected from ImageGrab is sent via requests.post to the webhook URL. The subprocess installs packages silently, which could be exploited for command injection if inputs were manipulated.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending a screenshot to an external server during installation, which is not typical for legitimate package setup scripts. The code executes network communication and package installation without user consent or clear purpose. The use of subprocess.check_call to install packages during setup is unconventional and potentially suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to perform actions after installation, including capturing a screenshot of the user's screen and uploading it to a Discord webhook. This behavior could be used to surveil or exfiltrate user data. The code also installs dependencies silently, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. No obfuscated code or obfuscation techniques are present. The core suspicious activity is the automatic capture and transmission of a screenshot during package installation, which is highly unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by capturing and exfiltrating a user's screenshot without consent during installation. The automatic package installation and network activity suggest an intent to surveil or compromise user privacy. Overall, this package contains clear malicious intent.",
