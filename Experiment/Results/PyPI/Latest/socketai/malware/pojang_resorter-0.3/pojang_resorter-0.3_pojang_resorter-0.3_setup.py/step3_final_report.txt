{
  "purpose": "The code captures a screenshot during installation and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Discord webhook, then installs dependencies silently.",
  "sources": "ImageGrab.grab() for screenshot, hardcoded WEBHOOK_URL for data exfiltration",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending screenshot to external server",
  "flows": "Source (screenshot capture) -> HTTP POST request to webhook (exfiltration)",
  "anomalies": "Automatic, user-unconsented screenshot capture during package installation; hardcoded webhook URL; silent dependency installation",
  "analysis": "The code performs covertly capturing user screenshots and sending them externally without user consent, indicating malicious privacy invasion. No obfuscation is present. The data flow from capture to exfiltration is straightforward. The activity is highly suspicious and constitutes malicious behavior, aligning with high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits malicious intent through covert data exfiltration of user screenshots during installation. The behavior justifies a malware score of approximately 0.9 and a security risk score of about 0.9, reflecting severe privacy invasion. No obfuscation is detected. The activity warrants classification as malicious due to privacy violation.",
