  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, representing a high potential for malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate but should be slightly increased to reflect the severity. The behavior alone justifies a malware score of approximately 0.75 and a security risk score of 0.8, indicating high suspicion and the need for thorough review before deployment."
