  "targets": "Multiple external URLs constructed with system info and a random number, accessed via urllib.request.urlopen()",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) are collected as sources, then encoded as URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to the external URLs (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Sending system information to suspicious domains; use of random number in URL path; no clear purpose for data collection; no user consent or indication of legitimate use.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then generates a random number to construct URLs pointing to suspicious domains. It sends HTTP GET requests to these URLs with collected system info as parameters. The URLs appear malicious or at least suspicious due to their domain names. The code operates silently, logs responses, and handles exceptions, which could be hiding malicious communication. There is no apparent legitimate purpose for sending system details to these external addresses.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be collecting system information and transmitting it to suspicious external domains, which suggests malicious intent or at least malicious potential, such as tracking or data exfiltration. The domains are unusual and likely malicious, and the code’s behavior is consistent with covert data collection.",
