  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains with oast.cn and oast.fun, which are known for testing and tracking, indicates potential tracking or data exfiltration. No user consent prompts or security measures present.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers environment info: hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to them. The URLs are from domains commonly used for tracking or testing (oast.cn, oast.fun). No validation or encryption is performed, and the data is sent unencrypted. The purpose appears to be to exfiltrate system details to third-party servers, likely for monitoring or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and transmits system identifiers to external domains, which could be used for malicious tracking or data collection without user consent. It does not include obfuscation, but the purpose appears suspicious. It aligns with behaviors typical of malicious data exfiltration scripts.",
