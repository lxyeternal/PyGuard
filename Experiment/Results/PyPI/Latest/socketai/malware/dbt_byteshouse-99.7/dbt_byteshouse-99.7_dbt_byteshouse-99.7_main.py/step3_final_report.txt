{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and transmits it via HTTP GET requests to suspicious external URLs, likely for tracking or data exfiltration purposes without user consent.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with embedded parameters",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, username, current directory) -> URL parameter construction -> HTTP GET request to external suspicious domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, transmission of system info without encryption or validation, use of random number in URL path, no user consent or validation, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info and sends it to multiple suspicious domains via unencrypted GET requests, indicating covert data collection. The URLs are associated with testing or tracking infrastructure. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads, but the behavior suggests malicious intent. The malware score is high due to the data exfiltration pattern, and the risk score is high due to privacy violations. Slightly increasing the malware score from 0.75 to 0.8 would better reflect the malicious potential, while the obfuscation score remains 0. The overall behavior aligns with malicious or tracking activity, warranting high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert system info exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or tracking behavior. The current scores are appropriate, with a recommendation to slightly increase the malware score to 0.8 for accuracy. No obfuscation is present, and the behavior poses a high security risk.",
