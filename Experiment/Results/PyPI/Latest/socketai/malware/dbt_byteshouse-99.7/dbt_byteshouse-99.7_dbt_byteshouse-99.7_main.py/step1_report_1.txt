  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data via constructed URLs to external domains",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path) combined into URL parameters and sent via URL requests to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, including obfuscated subdomains; sending system info to these URLs without user consent; no clear legitimate purpose for data transmission; use of random number in URL path; no validation or encryption of data",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then generates a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends this system information via GET requests. The URLs are unusual and could be used for tracking, profiling, or data exfiltration. No user consent or encryption is evident. Exception handling logs errors but does not prevent data transmission. The code could be malicious due to data collection and transmission to potentially malicious domains, although no explicit malicious payload or backdoor is present. It appears designed to track or identify system details without explicit user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system info and transmits it to suspicious domains without user consent, indicating malicious intent. It may be used for tracking or data theft, constituting a security concern.",
