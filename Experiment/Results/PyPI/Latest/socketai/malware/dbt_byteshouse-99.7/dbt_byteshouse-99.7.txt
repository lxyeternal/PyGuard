      "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, representing a high potential for malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate but should be slightly increased to reflect the severity. The behavior alone justifies a malware score of approximately 0.75 and a security risk score of 0.8, indicating high suspicion and the need for thorough review before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert system info exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or tracking behavior. The current scores are appropriate, with a recommendation to slightly increase the malware score to 0.8 for accuracy. No obfuscation is present, and the behavior poses a high security risk."
