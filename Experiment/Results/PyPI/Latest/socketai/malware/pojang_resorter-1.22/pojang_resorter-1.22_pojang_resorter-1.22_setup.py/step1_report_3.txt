{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation process to run an executable after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (via os.path.join), package data (find_packages, include_package_data), and the executable file path (os.path.exists). It also executes a subprocess to run an external .exe file.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True) executes an external executable, which could be malicious if the executable is compromised or malicious itself.",
  "flows": "Installation process (source: custom install class) leads to execution of an external executable (sink), based on the existence check.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically runs a .exe file after package installation without user consent, which is unusual and potentially malicious. No validation of the executable's source or integrity is present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports standard setuptools modules and defines a custom install command. During installation, it attempts to locate a specific executable ('your_executable.exe') within the installed package directory. If found, it runs this executable automatically. This behavior can be malicious if the executable is harmful or unauthorized, especially since no checksums, signature verification, or user prompts are implemented. The code does not perform any validation or logging before executing the external file, raising concerns about malicious activity or unwanted system modification. The use of subprocess.run to execute an external file post-installation is a common technique for malicious supply chain attacks or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior: automatically executing an external .exe file after package installation without user confirmation or validation. This behavior could be exploited for malicious purposes such as installing malware, backdoors, or unwanted software silently during package installation.",
