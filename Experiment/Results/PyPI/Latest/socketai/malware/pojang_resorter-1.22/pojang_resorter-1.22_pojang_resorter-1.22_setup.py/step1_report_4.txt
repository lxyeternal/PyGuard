  "purpose": "Define and install a Python package that includes a post-installation step to run an executable file.",
  "sources": "os.path.join, os.path.exists, subprocess.run",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run (executes an external executable)",
  "flows": "After installation, the code checks for and runs 'your_executable.exe' from the installed package directory.",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally executes an external executable file after installation without verification of its safety or origin.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, after performing the standard installation, constructs a path to an executable file within the installed package directory. If this executable exists, it runs the executable via subprocess.run. This behavior could be used maliciously if the executable is malicious, as it executes arbitrary code upon installation. The executable's path is hardcoded and not verified or validated. No input data is read, but executing external files post-installation is suspicious since it can be exploited to run malicious code silently. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or hardcoded credentials, but the act of running an executable unconditionally is a potential security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is that it executes an external executable immediately after installation without verification, which could be malicious. While it may be intended for legitimate post-install setup, this pattern is commonly associated with malicious behaviors such as silently executing harmful code. The code by itself does not show malicious intent but contains a potentially dangerous behavior that warrants caution.",
