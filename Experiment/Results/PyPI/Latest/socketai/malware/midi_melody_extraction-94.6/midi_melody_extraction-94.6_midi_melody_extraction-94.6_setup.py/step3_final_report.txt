  "purpose": "Detects and evaluates potential malicious behavior in the setup script, specifically the execution of external code during installation.",
  "sources": "The import and execution of 'main()' from 'main' during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' which could run arbitrary or malicious code during installation.",
  "flows": "From the run() method, after calling the superclass, importing 'main' and executing 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code ('main()') during setup, suspicious class name 'CrazyInstallStrat', no validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, unconditionally imports and executes 'main()' from 'main.py'. This pattern is unusual and risky, as it can execute malicious code if 'main.py' is compromised. The class name is suspicious, possibly indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores from reports vary, but higher malware scores (around 0.75-0.8) are justified given the potential for malicious code execution. The risk of supply chain attack is high when arbitrary code runs during setup. Without inspecting 'main.py', certainty cannot be absolute, but the pattern warrants high alert.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing external code during installation is inherently risky and potentially malicious. The scores should reflect a high probability of malicious behavior (around 0.8), with high security risk (around 0.8-0.9). The code itself is straightforward but dangerous due to its behavior. Caution is advised, and further inspection of 'main.py' is recommended before trusting this package.",
