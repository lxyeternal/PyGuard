  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing external code during installation is inherently risky and potentially malicious. The scores should reflect a high probability of malicious behavior (around 0.8), with high security risk (around 0.8-0.9). The code itself is straightforward but dangerous due to its behavior. Caution is advised, and further inspection of 'main.py' is recommended before trusting this package."
