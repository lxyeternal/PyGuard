  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom install step that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports and executes 'main()' from main.py during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' could potentially execute arbitrary code from main.py, especially if main.py is malicious or compromised.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method calls 'main()' from main.py, which is executed in the install process context.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior in a setup script: executing arbitrary code ('main()') from an external module during installation. The class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' suggests unusual or suspicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after performing standard installation steps, imports and executes 'main()' from main.py. This introduces a potential security risk if main.py contains malicious code, as it runs arbitrary code during package installation. No other suspicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code is present. The naming of the custom class is unconventional, but that alone is not malicious. The primary concern is executing external code during setup, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if main.py is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes code from main.py during installation, which could be malicious if main.py is malicious or compromised. The overall behavior indicates a high security concern due to code execution at install time, suggesting potential malicious intent.",
