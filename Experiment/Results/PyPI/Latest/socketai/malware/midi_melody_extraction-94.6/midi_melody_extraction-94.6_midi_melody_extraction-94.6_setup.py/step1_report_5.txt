{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'midi_melody_extraction' package with a custom installation step that executes a function from 'main.py' post-installation.",
  "sources": "Import of 'main' module within the custom 'run' method of the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'main.py' during installation process.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom 'run' method executes 'main()' from 'main.py'.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run' method of the custom install class calls 'main()' without any validation, input, or safeguards. The 'main' function could contain arbitrary code, which may be malicious or unintended. No explicit security checks or restrictions are in place.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, executes 'main()' from 'main.py'. This behavior is unusual because it runs code during the package installation process, which could execute arbitrary or malicious code if 'main.py' is compromised or malicious. The script does not perform any validation or security checks on 'main()'. The rest of the setup code appears standard and does not exhibit suspicious behavior. The intentional execution of code during installation is a potential risk, especially if 'main.py' is not controlled or verified.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious behavior: executing 'main()' during installation without safeguards. This could lead to executing arbitrary code during package installation, posing a security risk if 'main.py' contains malicious instructions.",
