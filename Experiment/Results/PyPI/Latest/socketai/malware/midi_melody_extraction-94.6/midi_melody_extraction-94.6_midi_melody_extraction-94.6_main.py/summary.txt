  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious external servers, indicative of spyware or fingerprinting activity. It does not contain active malware payloads or obfuscation beyond simple base64 encoding. The activity warrants high security concern due to privacy invasion and potential malicious intent, but lacks direct malicious code execution. Malware likelihood is moderate; overall security risk is high. Scores should reflect this: malware around 0.7, obfuscation near 0, and security risk around 0.75."
