{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (host name, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname, getpass.getuser() for username, os.getcwd() for current directory, get_mac_addresses() for MAC addresses, random.randint() for a random number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send data to external URLs, with URL parameters including system info and base64-encoded MAC addresses.",
  "flows": "Collected data from sources (system info, MAC addresses, random number) is encoded and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious external URLs with obfuscated domain names, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and consistent data exfiltration pattern without any clear user benefit. No input validation or user consent is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identifiers such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses across different OSes. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, then transmitted as URL parameters to three external domains. The URLs appear suspicious, potentially malicious or used for command and control or data exfiltration. No user interaction, encryption, or obfuscation beyond base64 is present. The code does not perform any harmful actions locally but stealthily transmits sensitive information. No malicious code execution or payloads are present. The primary concern is covert data exfiltration via HTTP GET requests to potentially malicious domains.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for stealthy data collection and exfiltration of system information to external domains. It does not perform malicious actions directly on the host system but could be used maliciously for espionage or unauthorized data theft. The external URLs and data exfiltration pattern raise suspicion. Overall, it presents a security risk as a spyware or data leakage tool.",
