  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64, likely for tracking or fingerprinting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and get_mac_addresses(); generating random number with random.randint(); encoding MAC addresses with base64.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests sent to external URLs with system info parameters, potentially exfiltrating data over the network.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, base64-encoded MAC addresses) are embedded as URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, encoding system MAC addresses in base64, and sending data without user consent or obvious purpose; no validation or encryption of sensitive data; silent exception handling; collection of system identifiers and random number generation possibly for fingerprinting.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs to external domains, appending collected data as URL parameters. It makes HTTP requests to these domains, which appear suspicious and possibly malicious, as they may be used for tracking or exfiltration. No clear user benefit is apparent, and no user interaction or consent is sought. The use of multiple domains and silent exception handling further suggests malicious or at least privacy-invasive intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects and exfiltrates system information to external servers, likely for tracking or fingerprinting purposes, with no clear legitimate purpose. Its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating a privacy violation and possible command-and-control communication for malicious activities.",
