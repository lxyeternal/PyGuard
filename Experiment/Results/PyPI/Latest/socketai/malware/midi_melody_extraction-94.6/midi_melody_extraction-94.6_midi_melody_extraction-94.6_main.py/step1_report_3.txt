  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory, and send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() which reads system network interfaces.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) -> URL parameters -> HTTP request to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated or suspicious domains; base64 encoding of MAC addresses; no validation or encryption of data; potential for data exfiltration. The code constructs and sends system info to remote servers without any apparent user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data to three external URLs via HTTP GET requests. The URLs appear suspicious, potentially malicious, and are designed to exfiltrate system info. The use of random numbers in URL paths and obfuscated domain names adds to the suspicion. No authentication or encryption mechanisms are used, and error handling is minimal, which indicates potentially malicious intent for data collection or exfiltration. No obfuscated code patterns or signs of malware like code injection, backdoors, or reverse shells are present, but the data exfiltration behavior itself is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs system data collection and exfiltration to suspicious external servers without user consent, indicating malicious intent. The use of encoded MAC addresses and multiple suspicious domains suggests a privacy violation or data theft behavior.",
