  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'ccxt-mexc_futures' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, such as name, version, description, author info, URL, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or output.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or suspicious code structures. Missing author and author_email fields are unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies metadata and dependencies without dynamic execution or untrusted data. No code injection, malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors are present. The script does not interact with external sources or perform operations that could be malicious. Missing author information might be incomplete but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe.",
