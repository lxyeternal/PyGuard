{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'ccxt-mexc_futures' Python module, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded package name, version, description, author, author_email, url, and required dependencies",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; straightforward package configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, description, dependencies, and classifiers. No code execution, input handling, or data manipulation occurs beyond static declarations. The dependencies are common Python libraries ('ccxt' and 'requests') with no indications of malicious intent. All fields are typical for a package setup script. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
