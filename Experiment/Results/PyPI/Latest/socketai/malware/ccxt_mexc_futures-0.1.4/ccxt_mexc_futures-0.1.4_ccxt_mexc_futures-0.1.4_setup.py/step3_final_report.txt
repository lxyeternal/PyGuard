  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; no other anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or embedded secrets. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code aligns with best practices for package distribution and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup script is benign, standard, and free of security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
