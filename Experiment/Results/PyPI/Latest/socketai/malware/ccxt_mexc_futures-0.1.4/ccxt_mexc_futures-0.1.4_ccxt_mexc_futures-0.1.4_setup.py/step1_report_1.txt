  "purpose": "This script is used for packaging and distributing a Python module named 'ccxt-mexc_futures' with its associated metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it only defines package configuration details.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as the script solely sets up package information.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "This is a typical setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The script does not perform any network operations, data handling, or sensitive actions. It appears to be a benign and standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities. The risk level is negligible.",
