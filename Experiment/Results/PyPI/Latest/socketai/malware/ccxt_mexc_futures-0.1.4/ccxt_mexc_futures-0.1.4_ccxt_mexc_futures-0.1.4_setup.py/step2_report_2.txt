  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools` to package a Python module named `ccxt-mexc_futures`.\n   - It defines metadata such as name, version, description, dependencies (`ccxt`, `requests`), classifiers, and Python version requirements.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no reading from external sources, no embedded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is straightforward, typical for Python package distribution, and contains no obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly state that the code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They emphasize the absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or any suspicious patterns.\n   - The confidence level is consistently high (1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Obfuscated score (0):** Correct, no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware score (0):** Correct, no malicious behavior or payloads.\n   - **Security risk score (0):** Appropriate, the script is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Points of Attention:**\n   - The only minor note is that some reports mention missing author and author_email fields, which is unusual but not malicious.\n   - No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned by all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n6. **My Overall Estimation:**\n   - Given the uniformity and thoroughness of the reports, I concur that the code is benign.\n   - **Malware score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n   - **Risk score:** 0\n   - **Justification:** The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe `setup.py` for packaging a Python module. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
