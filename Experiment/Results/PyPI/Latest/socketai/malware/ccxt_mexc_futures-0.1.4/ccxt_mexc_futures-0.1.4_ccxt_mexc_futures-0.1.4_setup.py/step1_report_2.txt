  "flows": "N/A; this code is only for package setup and does not process external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code follows standard package setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package configuration, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, no reading of external data, and no embedded secrets or credentials. All components are typical for a Python package setup script. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup configuration script for packaging. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical package distribution practices.",
