{
  "purpose": "Implements API request signing with static salt and user token, managing order creation and cancellation for the MEXC exchange.",
  "sources": "Reads userToken, salt, and request parameters; decodes salt via marshal and base64; uses time and input parameters for signature generation.",
  "sinks": "Generates request headers containing signatures, tokens, and timestamps; signs request bodies; potentially exposes static secrets if compromised.",
  "flows": "User token and salt are combined with timestamp to produce MD5 hashes; request parameters are included in the body; headers carry signatures and tokens for authentication.",
  "anomalies": "Static, hardcoded salt string encoded with marshal and base64; use of MD5 hashing; decoding salt with eval and marshal, which is unusual and potentially obfuscating.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API request signing using a static salt and MD5 hashing, which are cryptographically weak but not malicious. The salt's encoding and decoding via marshal and base64, along with eval, suggest obfuscation but not malicious intent. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The static salt and weak hashing are security weaknesses but do not constitute malware. The signature process involves combining userToken, timestamp, and request body to generate signatures, which could be exploited if secrets are leaked but are not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client with minor security weaknesses and obfuscation techniques. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The static salt and MD5 usage should be improved for security, but the current implementation does not pose a malicious threat.",
