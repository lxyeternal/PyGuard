  "purpose": "Collect system information (host, user, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads network interfaces for MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests with encoded system data to external servers.",
  "flows": "Data from system functions (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is encoded in base64 and included as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs contacted are suspicious and obfuscated (appearing to be malicious or tracking domains). The MAC addresses are base64-encoded and sent without user consent. The code gathers and transmits environment info silently, with no indication of user notification or consent.",
  "analysis": "The script collects host, user, current working directory, and MAC addresses from the system. MAC addresses are fetched via platform-specific commands and then base64-encoded. The script constructs URLs with these parameters and sends GET requests to external domains that appear malicious or suspicious. The URLs are obscure, and the activity appears to be tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any input validation, error handling is minimal, and the data transmission occurs without user awareness. No code obfuscation is present, but the URL domains and data collection are indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to silently collect sensitive system information and send it to suspicious external servers. The purpose seems malicious, potentially for tracking or data theft. The URLs are suspicious, and the data collection is covert. Overall, this code demonstrates malicious behavior with a high likelihood, and it should be considered dangerous for use.",
