  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to multiple remote URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reading system details via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and executing system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to external URLs with encoded parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) are gathered, encoded, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple URLs with suspicious domains, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, collection of multiple system identifiers, and sending to potentially malicious domains. The URL domains appear suspicious and possibly malicious. No explicit user consent or logging shown.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to obscure their value. The script then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to three suspicious domains, which may indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. No user interaction or validation is present, and error handling is minimal, silently passing exceptions. The domain names suggest malicious or suspicious intent, likely used for tracking or exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are found, but the act of gathering and transmitting system info without user consent and to suspicious domains indicates malicious intent or at least malicious behavior.\n\nConfidence is high due to the nature of data collection and suspicious domains. No obfuscation of code beyond simple encoding. The URL domains are clearly malicious or suspicious. Therefore, the overall behavior is potentially malicious, aligned with data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "conclusion": "This script collects system info and transmits it to suspicious external domains, which indicates malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or remote tracking. While the code is not heavily obfuscated or malware-infected, the behavior is highly suspicious and should be flagged for security review.",
