  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (system commands to retrieve MAC addresses), random.randint() for generating a number, and the constructed URLs with parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to send data to remote URLs, potentially for exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are collected, encoded, and included as parameters in URLs which are then requested over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts multiple external URLs with parameters that include base64-encoded MAC addresses and system info, which may be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The URLs are suspicious, possibly malicious domains (they do not correspond to known legitimate services). The code does not handle or validate the responses and silently ignores exceptions, which can hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses from the system, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and constructs URLs with these parameters. It then makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs. The external domains are suspicious and do not appear related to legitimate services, suggesting potential data exfiltration. The use of hardcoded URLs, encoding of system info, and silent exception handling are indicators of potentially malicious behavior. No code obfuscation or malicious payload execution is present, but the intent to secretly transmit system information is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly collecting system information and transmitting it to external, suspicious domains. While it does not perform destructive actions, its behavior aligns with data collection for tracking or malicious purposes. The URLs used are suspicious and indicate potential malicious intent.",
