{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data encoded in Base64 to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and get_mac_addresses() which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() is used to send HTTP requests with system data as URL parameters to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current path, base64-encoded MAC addresses) flows from sources through URL parameter encoding, then is transmitted via GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names; encoding MAC addresses and sending them to external sites without user consent; no validation or security checks before data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers potentially sensitive system information—hostnames, usernames, current directory, and MAC addresses—and encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It then constructs URLs to three external domains and performs HTTP GET requests to these URLs, passing the collected data as URL parameters. The code does not perform any validation, authentication, or encryption of data beyond base64 encoding. The external URLs appear suspicious, likely malicious, or used for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The code does not contain obfuscated code or malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft modules but does actively transmit system info to unknown servers, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for data exfiltration of system information to suspicious external servers, which is indicative of malicious intent. While it does not contain overt malware like payloads or backdoors, its behavior of collecting and transmitting system identifiers without user consent suggests malicious or tracking purposes.",
