{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data encoded in base64 to multiple external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads network interface details.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) which sends data over the network to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is gathered, encoded in base64, and then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains, with data embedded as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs URLs with user/system data, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends requests to suspicious or obfuscated domains. No explicit user consent prompts or logging are present; the data collection appears covert. The URLs are potentially malicious or maliciously obfuscated domains.",
  "analysis": "The script collects environment and network information, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data to external URLs. The use of system commands (getmac, ifconfig) is standard for gathering MAC addresses, but their combination with obfuscated domains suggests intent to exfiltrate data covertly. The URLs point to potentially malicious servers. No data validation or security checks are performed before transmission. The data transmission occurs unencrypted over HTTP. The code includes exception handling that suppresses errors, which can be a sign of stealthy data exfiltration. No suspicious file or backdoor behavior detected beyond data collection and network transmission. The script does not perform any destructive or malicious actions beyond data exfiltration, but the pattern indicates possible spyware or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for covert data collection and exfiltration of system and network information to external servers, potentially malicious domains. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads like system damage or reverse shells but exhibits behaviors consistent with spyware or data harvesting malware.",
