{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that, after executing the standard install process, imports and executes the 'main' function from 'main.py'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata and dependencies; imports 'main' from 'main'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run()' method calls 'main()' from 'main.py'.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual execution of external code ('main()') during setup, which is not standard practice and could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly imports 'main' from 'main' and executes it during the custom install process. This pattern is atypical and potentially dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The behavior could be exploited if 'main()' contains malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.4-0.6, security risk 0.6-0.75) are consistent with this suspicion. The absence of obfuscation is correctly noted. The risk primarily depends on the trustworthiness of 'main.py'. Given the behavior, executing code during setup warrants caution, and higher malware and risk scores are justified if the content of 'main()' is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' from an external module during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores assigned are reasonable, but the behavior itself poses a security risk. Without inspecting 'main.py', the safest stance is to treat this as a significant security concern, with a malware score around 0.6 and a risk score around 0.75.",
