  "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' from an external module during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores assigned are reasonable, but the behavior itself poses a security risk. Without inspecting 'main.py', the safest stance is to treat this as a significant security concern, with a malware score around 0.6 and a risk score around 0.75."
