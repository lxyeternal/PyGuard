{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules ('setuptools', 'requests', 'psutil') and reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The main concern is the execution of 'main()' from 'main' module during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class runs, calling 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior: running arbitrary code ('main()') during setup process. No visible indication of what 'main()' does; could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, after standard installation, imports and executes 'main()' from a local module. This behavior could be malicious if 'main()' contains malicious code, as it executes arbitrary code during package installation. The rest of the setup code appears standard. The import of 'main' and execution in 'run()' is suspicious, especially if 'main' is not part of the public API or is unknown. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The code does not connect externally or perform network operations directly, but executing 'main()' could invoke malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package's setup script executes an external function 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious depending on its implementation. The code itself is straightforward but the behavior of executing 'main()' is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if 'main()' contains harmful code.",
