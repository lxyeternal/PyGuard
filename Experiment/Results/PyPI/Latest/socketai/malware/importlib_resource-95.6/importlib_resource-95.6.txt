      "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' from an external module during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores assigned are reasonable, but the behavior itself poses a security risk. Without inspecting 'main.py', the safest stance is to treat this as a significant security concern, with a malware score around 0.6 and a risk score around 0.75."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicative of spyware or malware activity. While it does not contain destructive payloads, its behavior is malicious in intent, warranting a high malware and security risk score. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, it poses a significant security threat due to its covert data collection and transmission pattern."
