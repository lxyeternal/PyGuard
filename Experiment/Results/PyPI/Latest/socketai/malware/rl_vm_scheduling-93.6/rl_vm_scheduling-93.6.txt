      "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits a high-risk pattern of executing arbitrary code during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend assigning a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.8, reflecting the high potential danger. The obfuscated score remains 0, as the code is clear. This pattern warrants thorough review of 'main.py' before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a privacy-invasive data collection tool with covert exfiltration behavior. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads but poses security and privacy risks. The activity is suspicious and warrants caution, but it does not meet the threshold for active malware based solely on its code."
