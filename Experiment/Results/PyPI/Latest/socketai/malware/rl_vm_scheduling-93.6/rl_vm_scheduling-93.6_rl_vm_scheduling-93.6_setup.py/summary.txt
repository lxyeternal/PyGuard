  "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits a high-risk pattern of executing arbitrary code during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The scores in the reports are appropriate; I recommend assigning a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.8, reflecting the high potential danger. The obfuscated score remains 0, as the code is clear. This pattern warrants thorough review of 'main.py' before trusting or deploying this package."
