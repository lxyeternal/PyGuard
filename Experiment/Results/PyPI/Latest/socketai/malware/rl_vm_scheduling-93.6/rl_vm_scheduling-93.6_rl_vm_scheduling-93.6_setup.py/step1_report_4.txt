{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'rl_vm_scheduling' that customizes installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'setuptools', installation command override, import of 'main' from 'main.py' during install.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function during installation, which could potentially run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the overridden run() method calls the 'main()' function from 'main.py', which may execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run' method in the custom install class executes 'main()' from 'main.py' during install, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main.py' contains malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, upon running, imports and executes 'main()' from a local 'main.py' file. This behavior is atypical for standard setup scripts and could be exploited to execute malicious code during package installation. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present. The import of 'requests' and 'psutil' is standard for dependency management and does not indicate malicious intent. However, the automatic execution of 'main()' during install is a significant concern, as it may run arbitrary or malicious code embedded within 'main.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior: executing 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation, which could run arbitrary code. This behavior is atypical for setup scripts and should be carefully reviewed, especially the contents of 'main.py'.",
