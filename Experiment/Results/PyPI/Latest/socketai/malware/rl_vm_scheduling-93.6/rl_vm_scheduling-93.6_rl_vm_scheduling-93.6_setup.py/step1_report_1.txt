  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'rl_vm_scheduling' Python package that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class, which imports and executes 'main' from 'main.py' during installation.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'main()' from 'main.py' after installation, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main.py', which could contain untrusted or malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes 'main()' during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The code imports and runs external code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation steps, imports and executes the 'main' function from a local 'main.py' file. This behavior is unusual because setup scripts typically do not execute arbitrary code during installation. If 'main.py' contains malicious code, it would run automatically upon package installation, which could be a supply chain attack or backdoor. The rest of the code appears standard for a Python package setup, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious external network activity. The call to 'main()' is the primary concern as it may execute malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior by executing 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main.py' is compromised. This pattern is suspicious and warrants further inspection of 'main.py'.",
