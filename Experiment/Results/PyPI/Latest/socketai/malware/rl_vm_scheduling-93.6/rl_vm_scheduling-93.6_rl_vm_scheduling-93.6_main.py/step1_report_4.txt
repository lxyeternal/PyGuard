{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and network interface details via subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Uses urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs with query parameters containing collected data.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is gathered, base64-encoded, then included as URL parameters in HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs contacted are obscure and potentially malicious, resembling command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoints. The code encodes MAC addresses and transmits them without user consent or clear purpose. The use of random numbers in URLs may serve to evade detection or track responses.",
  "analysis": "The script collects MAC addresses via system-specific commands and encodes them in base64. It then constructs URLs with parameters containing hostname, username, current directory, and encoded MAC addresses, sending requests to external domains. The domains are suspicious, potentially malicious, and could be used for data exfiltration or C2 communication. No input validation or user notification is present, and the network activity appears covert. The code does not perform any destructive actions but is designed to secretly transmit user and system data.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it to unknown external servers without user consent. The target URLs and data transmission pattern suggest malicious or unauthorized activity, possibly for exfiltration or remote monitoring.",
