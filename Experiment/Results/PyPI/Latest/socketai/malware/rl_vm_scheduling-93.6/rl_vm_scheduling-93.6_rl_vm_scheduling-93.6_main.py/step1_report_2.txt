{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (host, user, MAC addresses) and send it to remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current user, current working directory, and MAC addresses. Uses subprocess to execute system commands for MAC retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Uses urllib.request.urlopen to send data to external URLs with embedded parameters, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, user, directory, MAC addresses) is encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts multiple suspicious domains with encoded system data; uses base64 encoding of MAC addresses, possibly for obfuscation. No explicit hardcoded credentials but contacts potentially malicious URLs. No clear user consent prompts or controls over data transmission. The URLs are suspicious and could be malicious C2 points or data exfiltration endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The script collects identifiable system information, including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses via platform-specific commands. It encodes MAC addresses with base64, perhaps to obscure the data. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends the encoded information as URL parameters. The data flow involves gathering sensitive data and transmitting it covertly over the network. There is no evidence of malicious code execution, backdoors, or system manipulation beyond data exfiltration. The URLs are unusual and appear to be malicious C2 or data collection sites. The code does not perform any malicious actions beyond data collection and transmission but is potentially used for tracking or exfiltration without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a data collection script designed to exfiltrate system info to suspicious external servers. It does not contain direct malware like reverse shells or system damage, but its behavior suggests malicious intent for privacy invasion or surveillance. The URLs and data collection method are suspicious, and this code could be part of a malicious supply chain or espionage tool.",
