  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to specified URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interface data.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data over the network to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered, encoded in base64 (MAC addresses), then URL-encoded as parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs that are suspicious (non-standard domains, potential C2 servers). Data encoding and transmission without user consent or explicit notice. No explicit validation or checks on the URLs. The code collects MAC addresses and other identifiers which could be used for fingerprinting or tracking. Exception handling suppresses errors without logging, which may hide malicious activity. No response handling or indication of what the server does with the data.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are base64-encoded and sent to multiple external URLs via GET requests. The URLs appear suspicious, possibly malicious or C2-like. Data is collected silently, with no user awareness. The code does not perform any malicious actions directly on the system but is designed to exfiltrate system information, which is typical in data theft or tracking scenarios. The code's structure is straightforward; no obfuscation or complex malicious code patterns are present. The use of URL requests to potentially malicious domains indicates malicious intent in data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for collecting system information and exfiltrating it to external servers, which could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. No explicit malware like file system damage or reverse shells is present, but the data collection and transmission behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
