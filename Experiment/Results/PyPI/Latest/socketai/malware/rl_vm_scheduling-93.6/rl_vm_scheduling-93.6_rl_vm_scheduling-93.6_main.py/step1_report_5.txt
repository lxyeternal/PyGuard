  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system info and network interfaces, and the random.randint() for generating a request ID.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send constructed URLs containing system info to external servers.",
  "flows": "Collects system data → encodes MAC addresses in base64 → constructs URLs with parameters → sends HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains, including one with 'oast-cn' and 'oast.fun', which are commonly used in security testing or malicious activities. The code gathers system info and transmits it without user consent, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64. The data is then sent via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs with unique request IDs. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads directly, but it performs data exfiltration to suspicious domains, which raises concern. There are no obfuscation techniques used; code is straightforward. The purpose appears to be tracking or fingerprinting the host system without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed to gather system info and transmit it to external servers, which is suspicious behavior indicating potential tracking or reconnaissance activity. Although it does not contain explicit malware like remote shells or destructive commands, its data exfiltration nature and communication with suspicious domains warrant caution.",
