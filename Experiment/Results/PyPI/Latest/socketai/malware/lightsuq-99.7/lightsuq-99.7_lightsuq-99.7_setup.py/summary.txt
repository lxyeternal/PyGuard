  "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing 'main()' during installation presents a serious security risk, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. While no malicious code is confirmed, the pattern itself is dangerous and can be exploited. The current scores are reasonable but could be slightly increased to better reflect the high potential threat. The overall security risk is high, and such patterns should be avoided in supply chain security practices."
