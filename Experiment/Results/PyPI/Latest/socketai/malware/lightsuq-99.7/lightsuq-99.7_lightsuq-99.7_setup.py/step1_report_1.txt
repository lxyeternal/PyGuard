  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'lightsuq' that customizes installation behavior to execute a function from 'main' module post-installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially the 'main' module import within the run() method of CrazyInstallStrat class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'main' module during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method calls 'main()' from 'main' module, which may execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The run() method invokes 'main()' during installation without any checks, which is unusual for typical setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, imports and executes 'main()' from an external module. This behavior is unconventional for setup scripts. The 'main()' function is executed unconditionally during installation, potentially running arbitrary code. Since 'main()' is imported dynamically at runtime, this could be exploited if the 'main' module contains malicious code or is tampered with. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of 'main()' during installation is suspicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time, which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. This behavior indicates a potential supply chain risk, as malicious code could be injected into the 'main' module or the package itself.",
