  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs via GET requests, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - gathering hostname, username, and current directory.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sending data over HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, username, directory) are included as URL parameters in requests sent to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded external URLs, sending system information without user consent, dynamic URL construction, no validation of URLs or data, and no response handling beyond logging.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system details such as hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number to append as a query parameter. It constructs URLs pointing to external domains, then makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs with system info as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely used for tracking or reconnaissance. The code does not process or verify the responses, and errors are logged. The behavior suggests data exfiltration or tracking, especially given the use of obfuscated URLs and the collection of system info without any user prompt or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system information and sending it to multiple external servers, which could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. The presence of hardcoded, obfuscated URLs and the lack of user consent or transparency are concerning. Overall, this code has a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
