  "purpose": "The code collects system information and sends it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or exfiltration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and user login name (getpass.getuser()), as well as generating a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system info and a random number as parameters, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Collects system data -> Constructs URL with parameters -> Sends HTTP request to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious domains (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) which resemble C2 or tracking domains. Sends system info to these URLs without user consent. No authentication or encryption. The purpose appears covert.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system information—hostname, username, current directory—and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and attempts to connect to multiple potentially malicious domains, logging responses or errors. The use of oast domains suggests it may be used for testing or tracking, and the data collection is done silently. No malicious code or backdoors are embedded beyond data exfiltration, but the behavior resembles tracking or reconnaissance activities. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident, but the activity itself could be used maliciously if unauthorized.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and transmits system information to external domains, which is suspicious and potentially malicious for data exfiltration or tracking purposes. It does not perform harmful actions directly but facilitates covert data transfer. The overall security risk is moderate, warranting caution regarding its use.",
