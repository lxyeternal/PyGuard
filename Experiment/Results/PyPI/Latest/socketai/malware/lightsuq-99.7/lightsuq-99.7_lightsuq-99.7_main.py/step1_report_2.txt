  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url)",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path, rd_num) are encoded as URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs are suspicious, hosted on domains that may be malicious or used for command and control. The code collects system info and sends it without any user consent or obvious purpose. Use of random.randint for generating rd_num might be to create unique identifiers for tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number, then sends this data to three external URLs via HTTP GET requests. The URLs seem to be malicious or at least suspicious domains, and the data collection appears to be done covertly. There is no input validation, and the code simply reports success or failure of the requests. The purpose of sending this info could be for malicious tracking or exfiltration. The code does not perform any harmful actions on the host system directly but does communicate system info to potentially malicious endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be used for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to suspicious domains, indicative of potential malicious intent or tracking. The URLs and data collection method are suspicious and should be considered risky.",
