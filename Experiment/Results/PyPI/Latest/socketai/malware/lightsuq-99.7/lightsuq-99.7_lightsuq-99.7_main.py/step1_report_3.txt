  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests sent via urllib.request.urlopen to remote URLs with embedded parameters including hostname, username, directory, and a random number.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) -> URL encoding -> HTTP GET request to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs URLs that send potentially sensitive system info to external domains. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely malicious or part of a tracking/exfiltration attempt. Usage of random numbers in URL paths may be to evade detection.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system details such as hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number for each request, likely to vary the URL or track responses. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains with the collected data as query parameters. The requests are made without validation or user consent. The domains look malicious or used for command-and-control, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic suggests the code's purpose is to silently gather and send system info to external servers, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is performing data exfiltration by sending system information to known suspicious domains without user consent. This behavior is malicious and indicates a high risk of privacy invasion or malicious control. The URLs' domain names and the nature of data sent are typical in malicious activity, such as tracking or command-and-control communication.",
