{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'spider-ai' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() function call, setuptools.find_packages()",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is processed or transmitted, no untrusted input is handled",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or input/output processing present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward package setup without obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls the setup function to define package metadata, including name, version, author, description, packages, classifiers, and Python version requirement. There are no user inputs, environment variable usage, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The description contains non-English characters, but this alone is not suspicious. The use of find_packages() is standard for package discovery. Overall, the code appears to be a typical, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package configuration for distributing a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data handling are present.",
