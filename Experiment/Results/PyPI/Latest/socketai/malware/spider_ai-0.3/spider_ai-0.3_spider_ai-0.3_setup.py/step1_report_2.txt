{
  "purpose": "This code configures the setup process for a Python package named 'spider-ai' for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the setuptools module functions such as setuptools.setup() and setuptools.find_packages().",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data can cause data leaks or harmful effects; the code primarily defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The setup() function takes package metadata and configuration data to prepare the package distribution; no untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The description includes Arabic text, but it is just metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the standard setuptools library to define package setup parameters. It specifies package name, version, author, description (including non-English characters), packages, classifiers, and Python version requirements. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package distribution scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code and adheres to normal packaging practices.",
