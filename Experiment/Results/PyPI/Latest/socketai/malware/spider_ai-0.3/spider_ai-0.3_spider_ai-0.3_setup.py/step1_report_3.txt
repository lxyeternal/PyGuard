{
  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and distribution of the 'spider-ai' Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Setuptools setup() function call, including package discovery and metadata assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or inputs; standard packaging code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code performs static configuration without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and package discovery. No user input handling, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The description contains Arabic text, but this is just metadata and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a benign package definition script.",
