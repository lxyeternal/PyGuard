  "purpose": "Standard package setup script for Python distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() call with package metadata, including name, version, author, description, packages, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, environment variables, network connections, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static metadata without data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. Arabic description is metadata, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools and calls setup() with static parameters. No dynamic or malicious behaviors are present. All reports concur that the code is benign, with no obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The description contains non-English text, but this is metadata. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. Confidence is high (1). No issues or suspicious elements are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
