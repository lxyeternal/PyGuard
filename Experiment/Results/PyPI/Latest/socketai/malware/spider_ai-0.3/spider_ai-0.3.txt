      "conclusion": "While not containing explicit malware or obfuscated code, the pattern of hardcoded external IPs, suspicious headers, and unvalidated user inputs indicates a significant security concern. The code could be exploited for malicious activities such as data exfiltration or C2 communication. The scores from reports, especially the high malware suspicion, are justified. Overall, it should be treated as potentially malicious with moderate to high risk."
