  "conclusion": "The code performs system info collection and external transmission with insecure practices, raising privacy and security concerns. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation but exhibits behaviors typical of data exfiltration scripts. The malware score should be around 0.2-0.3, and the security risk score around 0.5, reflecting moderate concern due to insecure network handling and privacy implications."
