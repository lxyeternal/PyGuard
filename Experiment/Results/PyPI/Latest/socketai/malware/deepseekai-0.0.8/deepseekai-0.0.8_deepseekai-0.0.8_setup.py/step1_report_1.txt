  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the deepseekai Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, variable definitions, setup() function with parameters including name, version, description, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the execution of setup parameters and the installation of dependencies.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining metadata and dependencies to invoking setup() which manages package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It imports setup tools, defines package metadata (name, version, description, etc.), and specifies dependencies and entry points. There are no dynamic code executions, no input handling, and no suspicious behaviors. The dependencies are straightforward, and the package's purpose is clearly documented. All functions and variables are typical for a package setup script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for a Python package intended to interface with DeepSeek AI services. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behaviors, and adheres to standard package configuration practices.",
