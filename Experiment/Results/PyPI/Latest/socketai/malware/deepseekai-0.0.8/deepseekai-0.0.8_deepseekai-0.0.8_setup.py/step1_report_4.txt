  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration for 'deepseekai', providing metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package metadata, dependencies in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require', and package discovery via 'find_packages'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input handling or data output present; no potential sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the setup process uses static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package discovery. No user input, external data sources, or dynamic code execution is involved. All components are typical for package distribution, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. There are no suspicious functions, no network operations, and no obfuscated code. It adheres to common setup patterns without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It safely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
