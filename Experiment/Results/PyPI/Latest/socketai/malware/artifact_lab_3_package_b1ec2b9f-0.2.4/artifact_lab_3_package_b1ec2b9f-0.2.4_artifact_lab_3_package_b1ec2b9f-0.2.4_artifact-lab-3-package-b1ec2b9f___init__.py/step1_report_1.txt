{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to be a Python module that performs some form of data processing or utility functions, possibly related to system operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, imported modules, and possibly user input via function parameters or command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or system commands that could process untrusted data, though no explicit calls are shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs to functions that may process or store data, but without concrete network or system calls, the flow is limited or unclear.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual obfuscation are evident. The code uses standard Python practices, and there are no indications of malicious intent such as data exfiltration or network communication.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, with imports, function definitions, and basic control flow. No obfuscated code, malicious imports, or suspicious behaviors like code injection or unauthorized data access are observed. It does not perform any network activity or system modification, and no sensitive data handling appears malicious. Without external context or hidden behaviors, the code seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard and does not contain suspicious or malicious patterns. Confidence in this assessment is high, and there is no indication of obfuscation or malware.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
