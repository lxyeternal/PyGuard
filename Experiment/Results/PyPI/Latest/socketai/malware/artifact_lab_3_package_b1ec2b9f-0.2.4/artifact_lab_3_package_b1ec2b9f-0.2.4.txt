While no active payloads or obfuscation are present, the pattern indicates reconnaissance or data theft. The scores should reflect high suspicion and risk, with a malware score around 0.55-0.6 and a high security risk (~0.7-0.75). The code should be flagged for further review due to privacy and security implications."

Reports 4 and 5 indicate moderate to high suspicion, with justified scores reflecting potential malicious intent. Benign reports correctly show no issues. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, with minor scope for adjusting malware suspicion upward in report 5."
