{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it specifies package configuration and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or code execution; no output or network operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; configuration data is static and controlled",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define a Python package, including name, version, packages, and dependencies. It relies on well-known functions without dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external data fetching. The only dependency specified is 'requests' with a fixed version, which is typical. No signs of malicious code such as network communications, credential handling, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on the provided content.",
