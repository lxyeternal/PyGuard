  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, specifying its name, version, included packages, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup.py' file reads its own code and the 'install_requires' list to determine dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; the code primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: reading setup parameters and dependencies without processing external untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package information and dependencies. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution present. The dependencies are standard, with 'requests' specified explicitly. The code appears standard and benign, solely related to package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
