{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure a Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list and the package structure via 'find_packages()'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified that process untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Dependencies are specified for installation; package discovery is performed via 'find_packages()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, using 'setuptools' for packaging. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are present. The dependencies listed are common Python libraries, and the code structure follows typical practices without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard and benign setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
