  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies, and uses find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static code with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; dependencies are explicitly specified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The package name appears to be a generated string but does not indicate malicious intent. Dependencies are typical and do not pose risks. No dynamic or external data processing is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
