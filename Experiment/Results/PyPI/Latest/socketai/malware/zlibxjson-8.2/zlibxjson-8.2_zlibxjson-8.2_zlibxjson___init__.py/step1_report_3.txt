  "purpose": "This module appears to initialize a package by importing the 'init' function from the 'main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'init' from '.main'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; only a straightforward import statement",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no apparent anomalies; no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement from a local module, which is typical in Python package initialization. There are no data inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no sinks where data could leak or cause harm. The structure is simple and standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard package initialization step without any malicious intent or security issues.",
