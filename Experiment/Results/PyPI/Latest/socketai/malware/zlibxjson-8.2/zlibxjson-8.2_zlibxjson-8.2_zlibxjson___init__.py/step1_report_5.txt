  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that re-exports a function from a local module. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no external interactions. This is a common pattern in Python packages to simplify API exposure. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this minimal code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to re-export a function. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
