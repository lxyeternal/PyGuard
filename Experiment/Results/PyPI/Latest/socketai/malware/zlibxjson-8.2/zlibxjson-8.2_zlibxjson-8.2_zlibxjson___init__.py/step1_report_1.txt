  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing the 'init' function from the main module",
  "sources": "The import statement from .main import init",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; only an import statement establishing a reference to a function",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports the 'init' function from a sibling module. There are no input sources, data flows, or sink points that could be exploited. The code does not contain any obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior. It is typical in Python package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only as a package initializer with a simple import statement. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
