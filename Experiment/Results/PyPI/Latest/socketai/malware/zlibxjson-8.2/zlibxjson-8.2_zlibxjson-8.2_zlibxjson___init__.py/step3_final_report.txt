{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing the 'init' function from a sibling module to set up the package environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports an 'init' function from a sibling module. It contains no data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, standard for package setup, and lacks any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident, and the code's simplicity confirms its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current assessment and scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's straightforward nature.",
