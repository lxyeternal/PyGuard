{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during installation and exfiltrates it via a hardcoded Slack webhook URL without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Commands executed via os.popen() to gather OS info, hostname, user, IP addresses, and current directory.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing curl command to send JSON payload containing sensitive data to external webhook.",
  "flows": "Source commands (os.popen()) gather system info, which is then formatted into JSON and transmitted via os.system() to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() and os.system() for data collection and transmission; hardcoded webhook URL; data sent during package install without notification; collection of sensitive info like hostname, IP, user, OS details.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info collection using subprocess calls based on OS, constructs a JSON payload with this info, and sends it via a curl command executed through os.system() to a hardcoded Slack webhook during installation. This activity occurs covertly, with no user notification or consent, and involves exfiltration of sensitive data such as hostname, IP addresses, user identity, and system info. The approach is straightforward, not obfuscated, and employs unsafe command execution methods, which are often exploited for malicious purposes. The data exfiltration during package installation, especially with hardcoded webhook and sensitive info, constitutes malicious behavior. The code does not perform destructive actions but poses significant privacy and security risks, indicating high malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration of sensitive system information during package installation. It should be classified with a malware score of 1 due to the high probability of malicious intent, and a security risk score of 1 because of privacy violations and potential exploitation. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, it is highly malicious and poses significant security and privacy threats.",
