{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it via a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'sys.platform' for OS detection, 'os.popen' commands for system info, 'os.getcwd()' for current directory, and 'os.popen('whoami')' and 'os.popen('hostname')' for user and host info.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an 'os.system' call executing a 'curl' command to a Slack webhook URL, which transmits collected system and user information.",
  "flows": "Sources such as system info commands and environment checks feed data into variables; these variables are interpolated into a JSON payload string sent through 'curl' to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'os.popen' and 'os.system' to execute system commands and send data over the network without validation; hardcoded webhook URL; sending potentially sensitive system info without any user consent or security controls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that gathers OS-specific system information, current working directory, and user info. It then constructs a JSON message with this data and sends it via a curl POST request to a Slack webhook URL. The use of 'os.popen' for system commands and 'os.system' for network communication can be considered unsafe, especially as it transmits detailed system data externally. The webhook URL is hardcoded, suggesting potential exfiltration of system details. No obvious input validation or user consent is present. The code does not perform malicious actions like damaging files or executing reverse shells but collects and leaks system info in an unprotected manner, which is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not overtly malicious but exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and exfiltrating it to an external service without user consent. It could be part of a data collection or reconnaissance activity. The security risk is moderate due to unencrypted data transfer and potential privacy violations.",
