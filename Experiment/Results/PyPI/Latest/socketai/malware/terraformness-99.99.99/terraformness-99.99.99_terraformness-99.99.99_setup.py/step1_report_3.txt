  "purpose": "Custom installation process that gathers system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Input sources include os.popen('uname -a'), os.popen('ifconfig'), os.popen('curl ifconfig.me'), os.popen('whoami'), os.popen('hostname'), and os.popen('systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist') depending on OS.",
  "sinks": "The collected data is formatted into a JSON payload and sent via os.system() using curl to a Slack webhook URL, which acts as a sink where data is transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system commands (sources) into variables, then into a formatted string, which is sent over the network to the Slack webhook via os.system() command.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes multiple system commands to collect detailed system info during installation and immediately posts this info to an external Slack webhook, which is unusual behavior for a package installation script.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install process in setuptools to run additional code. During installation, it collects system info such as OS details, network configuration, and user info using os.popen() depending on the OS. It then constructs a message containing hardcoded file info and system details, and sends it via a curl POST request to a Slack webhook. This behavior is suspicious because it collects potentially sensitive data and transmits it externally without user consent. The use of os.system() for network communication and gathering system info during package install can be indicative of data exfiltration or malicious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system reconnaissance and exfiltration of sensitive system data during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. This behavior suggests covert data collection and transmission to an external service, violating typical package expectations. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be considered malicious or compromised.",
