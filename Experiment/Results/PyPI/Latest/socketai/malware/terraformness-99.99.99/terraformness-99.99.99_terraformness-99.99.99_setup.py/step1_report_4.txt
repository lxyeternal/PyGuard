  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and sends it via a webhook to a Slack channel during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to gather system info and user details, os.system() call to send data over the network.",
  "sinks": "os.popen() for command execution, os.system() with curl to POST data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "System info gathered via os.popen() flows into the formatted JSON payload, which is then sent via os.system() to the Slack webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional collection of system info and user details, sending data to an external Slack webhook during installation, no user consent or safeguards, use of hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute additional actions during package installation. It collects system details such as OS info, hostname, user identity, and network info using os.popen() depending on the platform. It constructs a message with this data and posts it to a Slack webhook via a curl command, revealing potentially sensitive information without user approval. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the data collection occurs every time the package is installed, which could be used maliciously for tracking or information exfiltration. There are no obfuscation techniques, but the behavior of data collection and external reporting during installation is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs system information gathering and sends it to an external Slack webhook during package installation without user consent, indicating malicious intent or privacy violation. The code’s purpose seems to be tracking or exfiltration, which is malicious behavior. Overall, it poses a significant security concern.",
