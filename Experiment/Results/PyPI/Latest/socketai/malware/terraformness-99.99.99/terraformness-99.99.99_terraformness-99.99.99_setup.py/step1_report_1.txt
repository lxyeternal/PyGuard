  "purpose": "Custom installation script for the 'terraformness' package that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via os.popen('uname -a'), os.popen('ifconfig'), os.popen('curl ifconfig.me'), os.popen('systeminfo'), os.popen('ipconfig'), os.popen('tasklist'), os.popen('whoami'), os.popen('hostname'), and os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Executes a system command 'curl' with dynamically formatted data, sending potentially sensitive information over the network to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info (conf, ip, public_ip, pwd, hostn, who) is collected and then embedded into a JSON payload that is POSTed via the 'curl' command to an external Slack URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting detailed system information and sending it externally during installation without user consent. Use of 'os.popen' and 'os.system' for data collection and transmission is potentially malicious. The webhook URL appears hardcoded, and the data sent includes sensitive system details.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that gathers various system details based on OS platform. It then constructs a JSON payload with this data and sends it via a curl command to a specific Slack webhook URL. The data collection includes system configuration, IP information, and user credentials, which are transmitted without any validation or encryption. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and unsolicited data exfiltration constitutes malicious activity. The code's intent appears to be to secretly send detailed system info to an external service during package installation, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and exfiltrating it to an external webhook during the installation process. The activity is covert, with no user consent or notification, and poses security and privacy risks.",
