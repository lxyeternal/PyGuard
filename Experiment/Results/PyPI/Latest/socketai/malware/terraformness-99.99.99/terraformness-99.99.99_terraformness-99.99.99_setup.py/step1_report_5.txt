  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it via a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via os.popen and os.system, including uname, ifconfig, hostname, whoami, and curl commands.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data through an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL using os.system with formatted data.",
  "flows": "Collects system info from various commands, formats data into a JSON string, and executes an os.system call to send data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of system commands to gather sensitive system info; hardcoded Slack webhook URL; no authentication or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code runs during package installation, gathering system details such as OS info, IP addresses, hostname, current directory, and user identity. It then constructs a JSON payload containing this info and posts it to an external Slack webhook URL via a shell command. The webhook URL appears to be hardcoded and potentially malicious or at least invasive, transmitting sensitive system data without user consent. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, and the use of commands like 'curl' and 'os.system' to send information to an external service is suspicious. No input validation or user notification is present, and the code runs unconditionally upon installation, making it likely to be malicious or at least invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external URL during package installation, indicating malicious intent or severe privacy violations. It does not seem to serve a legitimate purpose related to the package's functionality and could be used for tracking or data theft.",
