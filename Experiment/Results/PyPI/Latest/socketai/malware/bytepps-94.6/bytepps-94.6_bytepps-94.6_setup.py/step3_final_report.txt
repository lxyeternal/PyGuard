{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that executes the 'main' function from an external module during package installation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.",
  "sources": "The import and execution of 'main()' within the 'run()' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup acts as a sink where untrusted or malicious code could be run, leading to arbitrary code execution on the target system.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'main' and its invocation within 'run()', which occurs during the installation process, leading directly to potential code execution at this point.",
  "anomalies": "The execution of external code ('main()') during setup without validation or restrictions is unusual and suspicious. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present, but the pattern itself is a security concern.",
  "analysis": "The code executes 'main()' from an external module during installation, which could run malicious code if 'main' contains harmful instructions. No validation or safeguards are implemented. The pattern is known to be risky, especially in supply chain contexts, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The scores in the reports underestimate the potential severity; given the pattern, a higher malware score (around 0.8) and risk score (around 0.8-0.9) are justified. The absence of obfuscation is correctly noted. Overall, this pattern warrants caution and further inspection of the 'main' module.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing external code during setup is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. Without inspecting 'main', the risk cannot be definitively confirmed, but the pattern itself is a common vector for malicious payloads. The scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.8-0.9.",
