  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing external code during setup is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. Without inspecting 'main', the risk cannot be definitively confirmed, but the pattern itself is a common vector for malicious payloads. The scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, with a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.8-0.9."
