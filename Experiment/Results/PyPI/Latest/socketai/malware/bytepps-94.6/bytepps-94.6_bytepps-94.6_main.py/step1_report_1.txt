{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs encoded in base64, possibly for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname; getpass.getuser() for username; os.getcwd() for current directory; get_mac_addresses() which reads MAC addresses via system commands.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending data to remote URLs with encoded parameters.",
  "flows": "Collect system info (sources) -> encode MAC addresses -> construct URLs with parameters -> send data via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple suspicious URLs possibly controlled by an attacker; encoding of MAC addresses before transmission; the URLs are obscure and suspicious; no explicit user consent or documentation; minimal error handling; potential privacy violation.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identifiers including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs to send this information via GET requests. The URLs are obscure and potentially malicious, indicating data collection or tracking. The code does not perform any malicious actions beyond data transmission, but the choice of endpoints and the lack of user awareness or consent raise security concerns. The code appears designed for covert data exfiltration, with no indication of malicious payloads or backdoors, but its intent and destination are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is potentially malicious due to its covert data collection and transmission to obscure external servers, suggesting tracking or privacy violations rather than benign functionality. Although no direct malware behavior like system damage or unauthorized control is present, its purpose and behavior raise security concerns.",
