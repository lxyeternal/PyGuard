  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in Base64, possibly for tracking or profiling.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (via get_mac_addresses()), and generates a random number (random.randint()).",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP GET requests to external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, random number) is encoded and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted over HTTP GET to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple URLs with suspicious domains, encoding MAC addresses in Base64, and sending system info without any user consent or obvious legitimate purpose. The URLs seem suspicious and possibly malicious. No clear user interaction or validation, and no response handling or logging. The code does not perform any apparent useful function besides data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system-specific data such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in Base64. It generates a random number to include in the URL. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends HTTP GET requests with the collected data as URL parameters. The URLs are obfuscated by their domains and paths, suggesting possible malicious intent. The network activity appears covert, with no user awareness. There is no validation, response handling, or logging, further indicating malicious or tracking purposes. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques, but the choice of domains and data collection pattern raise suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect system information and exfiltrate it to external, suspicious domains, likely for tracking, profiling, or malicious surveillance. No legitimate purpose or user consent is evident. The behavior indicates potentially malicious intent with a high likelihood of privacy invasion or system profiling.",
