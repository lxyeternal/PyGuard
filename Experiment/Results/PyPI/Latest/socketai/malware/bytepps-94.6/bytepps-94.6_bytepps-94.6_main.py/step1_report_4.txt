  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it encoded via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint(), get_mac_addresses() function",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with URL-encoded parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources → URL parameters → HTTP requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and no validation of responses; no authentication or encryption of data; hardcoded URLs; exception handling suppresses errors silently",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system data such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data via GET requests to three external URLs, which appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate services. The URLs are hardcoded and point to domains that could be used for malicious purposes such as tracking or data exfiltration. The requests are made without any form of encryption or validation. Exception handling is silent, which might hide network or other errors. The overall pattern indicates data collection and transmission potentially for malicious monitoring or surveillance, with no user consent or transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed to exfiltrate system information to untrusted, suspicious domains without user knowledge, indicating malicious intent. The use of encoded MAC addresses and external requests suggests a potential backdoor or tracking mechanism. While it doesn't contain overt payloads like malware or system damage, its purpose of covert data collection and transmission is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
