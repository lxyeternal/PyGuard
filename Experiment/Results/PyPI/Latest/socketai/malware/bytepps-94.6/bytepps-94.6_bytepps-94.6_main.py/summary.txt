  "conclusion": "The script is not malware in the traditional sense (no destructive payloads or backdoors), but it performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, which is highly privacy-invasive and suspicious. It warrants a high security risk score due to its exfiltration behavior. The malware score should be low to moderate, reflecting the absence of malicious payloads but acknowledging the privacy invasion. The obfuscation score is zero, as the code is straightforward."
