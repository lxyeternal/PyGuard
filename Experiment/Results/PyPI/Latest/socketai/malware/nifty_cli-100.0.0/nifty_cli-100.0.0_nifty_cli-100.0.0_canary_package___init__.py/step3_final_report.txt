{
  "purpose": "A simple marker or trigger script for monitoring or testing purposes in PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only executes a static print statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes a single print statement with static content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static print statement with no inputs, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior. Confidence in benignity is high (close to 1). There are no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign marker or trigger with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
