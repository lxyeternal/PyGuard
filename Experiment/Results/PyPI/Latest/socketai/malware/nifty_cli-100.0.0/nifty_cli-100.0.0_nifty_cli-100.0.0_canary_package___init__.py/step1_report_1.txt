{
  "purpose": "Prints a message indicating a 'Canary Trigger for PyPI', likely for monitoring or signaling purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only outputs a static message.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there are no data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist in this minimal script.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal with no complex logic or obfuscation; the message suggests a potential monitoring or trigger mechanism, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of a print statement that outputs a static message. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external network calls, and no sensitive data handling. Its simplicity makes it unlikely to contain malicious intent or hidden backdoors. The message itself implies a monitoring purpose, but without additional context or code, there are no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to output a message. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks. It appears to be a simple trigger or marker, possibly for monitoring or testing purposes.",
