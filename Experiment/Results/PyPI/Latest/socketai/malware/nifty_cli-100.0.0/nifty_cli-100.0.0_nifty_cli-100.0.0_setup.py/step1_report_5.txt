{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process for a Python package, during which it triggers an external Canary Token URL, potentially for security monitoring or malicious tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (USER), and hardcoded encoded URL (ENCODED_WEBHOOK). It also makes an HTTP GET request via requests.get to the decoded URL with package and user information.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data to an external URL, potentially leaking user environment data. The print statements output information to the console, but no sensitive data is directly leaked through standard output.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'USER' is read and included as a parameter in the HTTP request to the decoded webhook URL, which is decoded via a Caesar cipher. This flow could allow external monitoring of user environment and package installation events.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes the webhook URL with a Caesar cipher, suggesting an attempt to obfuscate its actual destination. The use of a hardcoded, encoded URL for triggering an external request during package installation is suspicious. There is no validation or restriction on the URL, and no user notification about this activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines a custom installation command that, during execution, decodes an obfuscated webhook URL. It gathers the current system user's name from environment variables and sends a GET request to the decoded URL with user and package info. The use of cipher obfuscation indicates an attempt to hide the true purpose. This activity can be used for tracking installations or potentially malicious data exfiltration. No malicious payloads like system damage, backdoors, or malware behavior are present, but the external call and obfuscation raise security concerns about privacy and intended tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs a covert external request during installation by decoding an obfuscated URL and sending user info, which could be used for malicious tracking or monitoring. Although it does not contain overt malware, the obfuscation and external contact without user consent are suspicious and warrant caution.",
