{
  "purpose": "The code decodes an obfuscated webhook URL and triggers an external GET request during package installation, sending environment info and package details, potentially for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'USER' and the hardcoded encoded URL are read; the URL is decoded via Caesar cipher.",
  "sinks": "The external requests made to the decoded URL with parameters, potentially leading to data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "flows": "The encoded URL is decoded, then used in a requests.get call passing environment info; this occurs during the install process without user notification.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a simple Caesar cipher for obfuscation; network request during package install; no user consent or notification; no malicious payloads but suspicious external contact.",
  "analysis": "The code contains an encoded URL decoded via a Caesar cipher, then makes an HTTP GET request during installation, sending environment info. This behavior is covert and could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. The obfuscation is minimal but indicates an intent to conceal the URL. No malicious payloads such as system modifications or data theft are evident, but the external contact during install is suspicious. The scores in the original reports vary, but given the external request, obfuscation, and potential privacy implications, a malware score around 0.3-0.4 is appropriate, with a security risk score of approximately 0.6, and obfuscation at 0.8. The activity warrants caution, as it could be exploited for malicious purposes, though it does not directly perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through external contact and obfuscation during installation, indicating potential privacy invasion or tracking. While not overtly malicious, it warrants further review and caution before use. The scores should reflect moderate malicious potential (around 0.3-0.4 for malware), high obfuscation (0.8), and elevated security risk (0.6).",
