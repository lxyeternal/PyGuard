{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process that includes custom installation logic to trigger a webhook URL, potentially for security or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "The webhook URL is stored as an encoded string; environment variables (USER) are read; external requests are made via requests.get.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data to an external URL (decoded webhook), which could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "During installation, trigger_canary() is invoked, decoding the URL, collecting environment info, and sending a GET request to the external webhook with package and user info.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded webhook URL using a Caesar cipher suggests an attempt to obfuscate behavior. The code triggers an external network request during package installation, which is unusual for a benign package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and requests, sets an encoded webhook URL, and decodes it with a Caesar cipher. During installation, it retrieves the current user via environment variable, then makes an HTTP GET request to the decoded URL, passing user and package info. The use of encoded URL and network request during install raises suspicion of tracking or malicious activity. No other malicious code like data theft or backdoors is evident, but triggering external requests during install is considered suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package is designed to send user and package info to an external webhook during installation, which could be for monitoring or malicious tracking purposes. The obfuscation of the URL and network activity suggest potentially malicious intent, though no explicit harmful actions like data exfiltration or system modification are present.",
