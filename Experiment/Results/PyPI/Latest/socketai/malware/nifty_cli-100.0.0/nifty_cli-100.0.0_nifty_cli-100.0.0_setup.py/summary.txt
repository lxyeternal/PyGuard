  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through external contact and obfuscation during installation, indicating potential privacy invasion or tracking. While not overtly malicious, it warrants further review and caution before use. The scores should reflect moderate malicious potential (around 0.3-0.4 for malware), high obfuscation (0.8), and elevated security risk (0.6)."
