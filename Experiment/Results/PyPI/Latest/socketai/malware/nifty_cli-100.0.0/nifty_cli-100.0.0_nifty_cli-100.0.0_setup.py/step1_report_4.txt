{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that triggers a Canary Token URL when the package is installed, ostensibly for security testing or monitoring.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'USER'; hardcoded encoded URL in 'ENCODED_WEBHOOK'; external HTTP request via 'requests.get'.",
  "sinks": "The decoded URL is used as a request target; parameters include the host user info, potentially leaking environment info; network request occurs during installation.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'USER' is retrieved -> URL is decoded -> URL and host info are sent via GET request to the decoded webhook URL during install.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded webhook URL appears obfuscated; decoding uses a Caesar cipher shift of 3 which is simple and suspicious; triggering a network request during package installation is unusual and can be misused.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines an encoded webhook URL that is decoded via a Caesar cipher. It retrieves the 'USER' environment variable, which may leak user info, and sends a GET request to the decoded URL with host user info and package name as parameters during the installation process. The installation command is overridden to trigger this network call before proceeding with standard installation. The use of obfuscation (Caesar cipher) and network communication during install indicates potential malicious intent or tracking behavior. The code's purpose to trigger a Canary Token URL suggests it could be used for security monitoring or could be repurposed for malicious data exfiltration or tracking if misused.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated URL decoding and performs a network request during package installation, which can be used for tracking or malicious purposes. It does not include malware like data theft or system damage but raises concerns due to obfuscation and network activity during install. Overall, it has moderate security risk potential mainly related to privacy and tracking, not direct harm.",
