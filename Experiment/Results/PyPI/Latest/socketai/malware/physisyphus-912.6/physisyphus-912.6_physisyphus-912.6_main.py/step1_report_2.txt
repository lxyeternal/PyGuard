{
  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - these read system hostname, username, and current directory; also the URL list is predefined.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) - sending data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) is gathered and embedded into URLs, which are then requested over HTTP, sending possibly sensitive information.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs and sends system info to suspicious domains. The URLs are obscure and appear designed for tracking or malicious purposes. Random number 'rd_num' varies per execution, possibly to evade detection or correlate data. No user input handling is present, but the remote URLs and data exfiltration are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, and current working directory, then sends this info along with a random number to multiple external domains via HTTP GET requests. The domains are obscure and potentially malicious, indicating possible data exfiltration or tracking. No authentication or encryption is used, which amplifies risk. The code does not perform any validation or checks before data transmission. The purpose appears to be malicious data collection rather than benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious, likely malicious, as it stealthily collects system information and transmits it to suspicious domains. The absence of encryption, presence of obscure domains, and data exfiltration pattern strongly indicate malicious intent.",
