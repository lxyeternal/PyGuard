      "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, as it can run malicious code without user consent. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main.py', the pattern itself warrants a high security alert. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this high risk, with malware score around 0.7 and security risk near 0.8. No obfuscation is present, and the code is straightforward."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior consistent with covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains. While it does not contain explicit malicious payloads like code execution or data theft, its stealthy data transmission pattern is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The malware score should be high, around 0.8, reflecting the malicious potential, and the security risk score should also be elevated (~0.8). Obfuscation is not present. Overall, this code should be considered high risk due to privacy invasion and covert exfiltration activities."
