  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, as it can run malicious code without user consent. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main.py', the pattern itself warrants a high security alert. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this high risk, with malware score around 0.7 and security risk near 0.8. No obfuscation is present, and the code is straightforward."
