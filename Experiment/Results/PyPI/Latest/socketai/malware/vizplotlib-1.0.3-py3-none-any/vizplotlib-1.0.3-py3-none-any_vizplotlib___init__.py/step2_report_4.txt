  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement; no issues detected.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound; no malicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward import.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no issues.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws identified; reasoning consistent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** Slightly less than 1, but still high.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Again, just an import statement.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — this is slightly above zero, but given the code's simplicity, a small risk score may be acceptable as a conservative estimate.  \n- **Note:** The risk score of 0.1 is marginal; no actual suspicious activity is indicated.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** No issues; minimal import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — similar to previous, slightly elevated but still negligible.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same benign import.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statement.  \n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with some reports assigning 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0.1 might be slightly overstated. A more appropriate value would be 0, unless there is additional context indicating potential security concerns.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code is a simple import statement with no malicious or obfuscated content.  \n- The scores for malware and obfuscation are correct.  \n- The risk scores should be uniformly **0**, as there's no evidence of security risk in such a minimal, benign import.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis above.",
