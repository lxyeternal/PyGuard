{
  "purpose": "Importing a function named 'chart_e' from a local module 'vizplotlib' for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module file 'vizplotlib.py' or its compiled version in the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows are present; the code only imports a function.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple relative import of 'chart_e' from a local module named 'vizplotlib'. It does not execute any functions or contain any logic that could be malicious. The import statement alone is unlikely to be malicious unless the imported module itself contains malicious code. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are present. Since the snippet is minimal, it does not provide evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement for a local module function. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a benign part of a larger visualization or plotting package.",
