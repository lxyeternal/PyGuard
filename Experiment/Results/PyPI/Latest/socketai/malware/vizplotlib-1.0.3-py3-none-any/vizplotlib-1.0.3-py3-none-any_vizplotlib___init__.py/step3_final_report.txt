  "purpose": "Import the function 'chart_e' from the local module 'vizplotlib'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code only imports a function.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the import is static and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of 'chart_e' from a local module 'vizplotlib'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The import does not involve data input, network activity, or code execution beyond loading a local function. The minimal code and lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score. The slight risk score of 0.1 in some reports may be a conservative estimate considering potential risks in the imported module, but based solely on this snippet, the risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and the risk score at 0.",
