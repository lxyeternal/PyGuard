{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'chart_e' from a local module 'vizplotlib', likely for visualization purposes within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a module and a function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; it does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward import statement referencing a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks in this minimal code snippet. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where 'vizplotlib' provides visualization functions. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import statement for visualization functionality. No malicious or security concern signals are detected.",
