{
  "purpose": "This setup script configures the packaging of the 'pojang_resorter' Python project, specifying dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the package metadata, dependencies list, and entry point specification.",
  "sinks": "The setup process itself does not process untrusted data; potential concerns relate to the dependencies and the entry point code executed during runtime.",
  "flows": "The setup defines dependencies and entry points that, when executed, could invoke external or malicious code if compromised, but the setup script itself only declares configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present in this static configuration script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools configuration with common dependencies and a typical entry point. No embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is detected. The dependencies are widely used libraries; their malicious potential depends on the runtime code, which is outside this setup script. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), assuming the main application code is benign. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears legitimate and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal based on this configuration, but the security posture depends on the actual implementation of the main module, which is not provided.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
