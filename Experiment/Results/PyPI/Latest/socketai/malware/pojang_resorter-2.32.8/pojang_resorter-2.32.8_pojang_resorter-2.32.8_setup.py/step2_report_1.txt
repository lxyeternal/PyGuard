  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools.\n- The dependencies listed are common for GUI automation, image processing, network requests, and Windows system interactions.\n- No report indicates any suspicious code, obfuscated segments, or malicious behavior within this setup script.\n- The entry point references a main function in the `pojang_resorter.__main__` module, which is not provided here. The security of the actual executable logic depends on that module, but the setup configuration itself appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** No issues are evident in the setup script itself.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** None detected in this configuration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Suspicious code or anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- **Use of dependencies:** The listed dependencies are typical for automation, image processing, network communication, and Windows-specific tasks.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0.2), which aligns with the benign nature of the setup script.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with no malicious code being present here.\n- The confidence levels are high, indicating the reviewers agree on the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based solely on this setup script:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* No malicious code, no suspicious dependencies, no obfuscated code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  *Justification:* Clear, standard setup code with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 to 0.2  \n  *Justification:* Very low; the main concern would be the code executed in `pojang_resorter.__main__`, which is not included here. The setup configuration itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The security of the overall package depends on the code within `pojang_resorter.__main__`. Since that is not provided, the current assessment only applies to this setup script.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                | No malicious code or suspicious dependencies present.     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                | Code is clear and straightforward.                         |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1 - 0.2        | Minimal risk from dependencies; main logic unreviewed.   |\n\nThis analysis confirms the setup script appears legitimate and poses no security concerns on its own.",
