  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly importing main function and defining metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, setting __version__ and __author__ variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output, no external connections or data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import is static, and metadata assignments are benign",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module, assigns static version and author strings, and includes no runtime logic, input handling, or external network interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward and appears to serve as a metadata and entry point setup for the package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
