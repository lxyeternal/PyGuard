  "purpose": "Provides basic package metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports from a local module (.main). No input or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no data output, network calls, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static metadata and a module import are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata and imports a main function without executing any code beyond import. There are no data inputs, no network activity, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated patterns. It appears to be a standard, benign package initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only package metadata and a standard import statement. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
