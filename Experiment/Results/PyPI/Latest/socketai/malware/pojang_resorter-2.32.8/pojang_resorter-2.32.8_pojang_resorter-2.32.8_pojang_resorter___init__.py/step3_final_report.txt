  "purpose": "Package initialization and metadata declaration for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.main', setting version and author metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statement and metadata assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of setting package metadata (__version__, __author__) and importing a main function from a local module. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for a Python package's entry point, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
