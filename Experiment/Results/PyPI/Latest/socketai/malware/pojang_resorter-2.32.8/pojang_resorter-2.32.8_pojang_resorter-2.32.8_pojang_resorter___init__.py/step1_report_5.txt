  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main module. It is a straightforward module with no data handling, no code execution, and no external connections or suspicious activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be boilerplate for a Python package, containing only metadata and an import statement. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies identified. The package likely functions as intended, providing CLI tools without hidden or malicious actions.",
