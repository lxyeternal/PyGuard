{
  "purpose": "Provides a basic interface and version information for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .main import main' to load the main function from the local module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible as the code only contains import and metadata declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a local module, sets version and author metadata. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no code execution beyond import. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. Given the simplicity, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code serves as a package initializer with standard metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package initializer for a Python CLI tool, with no malicious or security concerning elements detected. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
