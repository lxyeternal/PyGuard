  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a relative module, sets version and author metadata. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The code appears to be a typical package entry point with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code. It lacks any dynamic execution, external data access, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initialization file with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It functions to set up package metadata and import core functionality.",
