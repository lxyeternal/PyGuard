  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\n\"\"\"\nPojang Resorter Package\n\nThis package provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom .main import main\n\n__version__ = '2.32.8'\n__author__ = 'George Hammond'\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata and import\n- **Findings:** No input/output, no data flow, no anomalies\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, straightforward\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code only sets metadata and imports a function. No malicious behavior, no data flow, no suspicious activity. The confidence score of 1 seems appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata and import\n- **Findings:** Same as above, no untrusted data, no external interactions\n- **Conclusion:** Standard package setup\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is minimal and standard. Confidence score of 1 is justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata and import\n- **Findings:** No runtime logic, no external connections\n- **Conclusion:** Metadata setup, no malicious behavior\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. The code snippet is benign. Confidence of 1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Basic interface and version info\n- **Findings:** Import, no data processing or external interactions\n- **Conclusion:** Typical package initializer\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. No signs of malicious activity. Confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Metadata and import\n- **Findings:** No data handling, no suspicious code\n- **Conclusion:** Boilerplate, safe\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. Confidence of 1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The code is a minimal, standard package initialization script.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:**  \n  No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0 across reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential Risks:**  \n  Given the code snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  **0** — No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  **0** — Code is clear, minimal, and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  **0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, the package appears entirely benign. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there is no evidence to suggest malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the consensus and the code's simplicity.",
