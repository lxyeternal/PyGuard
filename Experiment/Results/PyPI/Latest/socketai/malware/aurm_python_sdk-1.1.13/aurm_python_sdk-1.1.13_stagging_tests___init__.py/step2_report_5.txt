  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a standard `__init__.py` file that imports `test_function` from `module1` and defines `__all__`. This is typical for package initialization and testing setups.\n\n2. **Logical & Security Analysis:**  \n   - No data flows, no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.\n   - No signs of malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves a clear purpose: exposing a function for testing.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification:**  \n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0.\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, these scores seem appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1, which is reasonable for such a straightforward code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**  \n   - The reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malicious behavior.\n   - There are no hidden or obfuscated elements; the code is transparent.\n   - No external data or untrusted sources are involved.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Recommendations:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No changes needed; the assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**My own evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a benign, standard package initialization file with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The existing scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that `module1` itself does not contain malicious code, but based on the provided snippet, the `__init__.py` is safe.",
