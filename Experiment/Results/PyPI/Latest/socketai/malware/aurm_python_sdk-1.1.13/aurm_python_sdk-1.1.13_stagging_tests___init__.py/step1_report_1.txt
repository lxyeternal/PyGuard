  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that lead to data leaks or untrusted actions.",
  "flows": "The import statement does not create any source-to-sink data flows or execute untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard package init file with no suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a local module and defines '__all__' for export. It serves as a typical package initializer for testing purposes. No malicious or security-sensitive code present. There is no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
