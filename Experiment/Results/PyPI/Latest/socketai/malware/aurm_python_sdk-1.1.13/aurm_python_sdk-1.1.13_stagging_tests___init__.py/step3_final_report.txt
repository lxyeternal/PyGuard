  "purpose": "Standard package initializer importing a test function from a local module and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external sources involved",
  "flows": "Import from local module to __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports test_function from a local module and exposes it. It contains no suspicious logic, no external data handling, and no obfuscation. The import is from a local module, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code's purpose is benign, serving as a package initializer. No anomalies or security concerns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the analysis.",
