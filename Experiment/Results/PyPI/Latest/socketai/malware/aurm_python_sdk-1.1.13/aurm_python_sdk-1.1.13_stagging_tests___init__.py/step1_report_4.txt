  "purpose": "Initialize the tests package and expose test_function from module1 for external use",

  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Import statement loads test_function from module1, then it is exposed via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package init file. It imports a function from a relative module and defines __all__ to control export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or unusual activity. No external data sources or sinks are present, and the structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
