{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote file during installation, saves it as ~/.fleetwood.py, and appends a command to execute this script in the user's shell configuration files, enabling remote code execution at shell startup.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen to fetch remote content; open() to write to ~/.fleetwood.py; open() to append to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' via shell startup files; potential execution of malicious remote code",
  "flows": "Remote URL fetch -> Save as ~/.fleetwood.py -> Append command to shell config files -> Shell startup executes remote script",
  "anomalies": "Unverified remote code download; no signature or checksum validation; broad exception handling hiding errors; silent modification of user environment files",
  "analysis": "The code performs a remote fetch of a script during package installation, writes it to a hidden file, and modifies user shell configuration files to execute this script automatically. No validation or user consent is present. The behavior facilitates persistent remote code execution, posing high security risks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The broad exception handling masks potential errors, increasing risk. The pattern aligns with malicious backdoors or persistence mechanisms, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior consistent with malicious activity, including remote code fetch, silent environment modification, and automatic execution. Scores of approximately 0.9 for malware and security risk are justified, with obfuscation score of 0. This package should be considered malicious or highly insecure and warrants caution or removal.",
