  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static greeting string, likely used as a placeholder or test.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communications, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function returns a static string directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static function with no dependencies, inputs, or malicious features. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The code's simplicity and static behavior confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, trivial test function with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
