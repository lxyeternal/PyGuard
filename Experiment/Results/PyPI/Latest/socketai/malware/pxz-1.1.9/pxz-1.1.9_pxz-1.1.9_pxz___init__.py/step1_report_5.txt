  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but the actual purpose cannot be fully determined due to lack of context and content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands, but specifics are not evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through functions to sinks like network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows standard Python code with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. No suspicious data flows or unusual code constructs are identified. Usage of external libraries appears typical. The lack of sensitive data handling, network activity, or backdoor-like code indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign. However, due to limited context, some risks cannot be entirely ruled out without additional code.",
