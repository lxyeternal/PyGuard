{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (public IP, hostname, directories, timestamp) during package installation and sends it to a hardcoded external server, potentially for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The function collect_system_info() reads system info, makes an HTTP request to an external URL, and gathers data from os and datetime modules.",
  "sinks": "The URL request to 'http://35.170.187.220:8080/' acts as the sink where data is transmitted to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system info collection variables to URL parameter encoding, then via an HTTP GET request to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs silent data exfiltration during installation without user notification, uses a hardcoded server URL, and transmits sensitive info via HTTP GET, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system data and exfiltrates it to an external server during package installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The data includes public IP, hostname, directories, and timestamp, sent via an unencrypted HTTP request. No obfuscation or user notification is present. The behavior aligns with malicious or privacy-invasive activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.75-1, security risk 0.75-1) are justified given the covert data collection and exfiltration. The code does not contain destructive payloads but performs high-risk data transmission without user consent, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior by silently collecting and transmitting system information during installation. While it lacks active malicious payloads, its covert exfiltration activity justifies a malware score around 0.8 and a security risk score near 0.9. The activity is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious, warranting serious concern in supply chain security.",
