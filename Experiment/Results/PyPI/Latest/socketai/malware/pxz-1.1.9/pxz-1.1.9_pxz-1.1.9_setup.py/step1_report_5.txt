{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "URL request to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP; os.uname() for hostname; os.path.expanduser('~') for home directory; os.getcwd() for current directory; datetime.now() for current time; URL construction for data transmission.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP GET request to 'http://35.170.187.220:8080/' which could potentially leak sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info functions flows into URL parameters, then is transmitted via an HTTP GET request to the specified server.",
  "anomalies": "The script automatically sends system information to an external IP address during package installation without user consent. No user input validation or consent mechanisms are present. The remote server IP is hardcoded. The function runs during install, which is unusual for a package intended for benign purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system modules and network request modules to gather system info such as public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and current time. It constructs a URL with these parameters and sends a GET request to a hardcoded external server IP. This behavior resembles a potentially malicious activity such as system fingerprinting or data exfiltration. The custom install class overrides the run method to invoke this info collection process during installation, which is atypical for standard package behavior. The collected data includes potentially sensitive information like public IP and hostname and transmits it without user knowledge or consent. No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present. The behavior suggests an intent to silently exfiltrate system data, raising security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs unauthorized collection and transmission of system information to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior. The code exhibits no obfuscation but uses network requests and system info collection in a way that could compromise user privacy and security.",
