{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information from os.uname(), os.getcwd(), and os.path.expanduser(). It also fetches the public IP address via a URL request to 'https://api.ipify.org'.",
  "sinks": "The collected data is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server at 'http://35.170.187.220:8080/', with data embedded in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Source: system info gathering functions (os.uname, getcwd, expanduser, URL fetch for IP). Data flows into URL parameter string, which is then sent via urlopen() to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system info and automatically sends it to a specific external server during package installation, which is unusual behavior for a standard setup script. Hardcoded server URL and data transmission on install are suspicious. No obfuscation or encoding is used to hide these actions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup activities but includes a function 'collect_system_info()' that gathers sensitive system details and transmits them to an external IP address. This behavior is embedded in the custom install command, meaning it executes during package installation. The data sent includes public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and current time, all of which can be used for tracking or reconnaissance. The server URL is hardcoded. No user consent or warning is provided. The use of urllib for network communication and immediate data transmission during installation suggests potentially malicious intent, possibly for surveillance or malicious tracking. There are no signs of obfuscation or attempts to conceal the data exfiltration. The code does not appear to perform any malicious activity beyond data collection and transmission, but doing so without user knowledge or consent is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects detailed system information and transmits it to a remote server during package installation, indicating potentially malicious behavior such as system reconnaissance or data exfiltration. This is not typical or benign behavior for a setup script and warrants suspicion.",
