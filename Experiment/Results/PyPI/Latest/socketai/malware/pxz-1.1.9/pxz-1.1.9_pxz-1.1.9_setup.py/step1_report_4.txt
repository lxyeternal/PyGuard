{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that collects system information and sends it to a specified server during installation.",
  "sources": "URL request to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP, os.uname() for hostname, os.path.expanduser('~') for home directory, os.getcwd() for current directory, datetime.now() for current time, and the constructed URL for data transmission.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with embedded system info sent via urlopen(), transmitting potentially sensitive data to an external IP.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data, constructs a GET request URL with system info, then sends this request to the server URL; this occurs during package installation via CustomInstallCommand.run().",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects and transmits detailed system info, including public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and current time, without user consent or notification. It contacts an external IP (http://35.170.187.220:8080/) without validation, which could be malicious. No authentication or encryption is used for data transfer. The function is invoked automatically during package installation, which is unusual for typical setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script incorporates a custom install command that, during the package installation process, executes collect_system_info(). This function gathers sensitive system data such as public IP, hostname, user home directory, current working directory, and current timestamp. It then constructs a URL with these parameters and sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external server IP. The external communication occurs transparently during installation without user awareness. The code does not verify the server's identity or encrypt the data, and the server URL appears suspicious, possibly malicious. The purpose seems to be to exfiltrate system data, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively and secretly collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external server during package installation. This behavior strongly suggests malicious activity, likely intended for system profiling or data theft, without user consent or knowledge.",
