{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that collects and sends system information during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system info: public IP via URL, hostname via os.uname(), home directory via expanduser, current directory via getcwd(), current time via datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP GET request to a remote server URL.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> encodes as URL parameters -> sends via HTTP GET request to server.",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers sensitive system information and transmits it to an external IP address during package installation without explicit user consent; hardcoded server URL; no user notification or consent; performs network activity at install time.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function collect_system_info() that collects system details including public IP, hostname, user home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It constructs a URL with these parameters and sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address, potentially exfiltrating data. The custom install class triggers this function during package installation, which is unusual and could be malicious, especially since no user warning or opt-in is provided. The code does not perform any malicious modification of the system but actively transmits data to an external server, which could be used for tracking or malicious surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively collects sensitive system information and transmits it to an external server during package installation without user knowledge or consent, indicating malicious or suspicious behavior. While it does not modify or damage the system, the exfiltration activity is concerning and likely malicious.",
