  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior by silently collecting and transmitting system information during installation. While it lacks active malicious payloads, its covert exfiltration activity justifies a malware score around 0.8 and a security risk score near 0.9. The activity is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious, warranting serious concern in supply chain security."
