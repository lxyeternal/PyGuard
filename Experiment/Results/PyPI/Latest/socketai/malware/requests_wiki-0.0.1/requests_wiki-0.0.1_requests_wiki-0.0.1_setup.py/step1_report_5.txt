{
  "purpose": "Collects system and network information and sends it to a remote server, potentially for malicious surveillance or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via platform, socket, getpass; HTTP requests via requests.get and requests.post.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data to external server in send_data function.",
  "flows": "System info gathered by get_system_info(), then transmitted via send_data().",
  "anomalies": "Code is designed to gather extensive system information and transmit it to an external IP without user consent; comments indicate intent for malicious use. The code runs automatically after package setup, which is unusual and suspicious. The URL to the attacker's server is hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to gather detailed system information, including hostname, IP addresses, username, and public IP with geolocation. It then sends this data to a remote server. The presence of comments indicating 'malicious package' and the immediate execution of info collection and transmission after setup suggests malicious intent. The package setup is typical for benign packages but is combined with code that performs malicious data exfiltration, which indicates a supply chain attack vector. Usage of requests for network operations and automatic execution post-installation are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package appears designed to collect detailed system and network information and send it to an external server without user consent, indicative of malicious behavior. The code's structure and comments strongly suggest malicious intent, fitting a typical data theft or surveillance backdoor.",
