{
  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to a specified remote server, potentially for unauthorized surveillance or data collection.",
  "sources": "Input sources include socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), getpass.getuser(), and requests to external URL (https://ipinfo.io) and the malicious reporting server (http://38.181.219.70:5000/report).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via requests.post to an external URL, which could be used to exfiltrate collected sensitive data. The get_system_info() function gathers potentially sensitive info like hostname, IP, username, and location.",
  "flows": "Source functions (get_system_info()) gather system and network info; this data flows into send_data() which transmits it to a remote server. The malicious intent is evident in the automatic data exfiltration upon installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes system info collection and data transmission immediately after module load, without user consent. Commented-out password retrieval suggests potential for more sensitive data access. The URL 'http://38.181.219.70:5000/report' is suspicious, indicating malicious command and control activity. The setup script automatically runs get_system_info() and send_data() post-install, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common system libraries and requests, then defines functions to collect system info and send it to a remote server. It retrieves detailed system info, including hostname, IP, user, and geographical location, then posts this data without user interaction or consent. The setup() function specifies package metadata and is followed by code that executes get_system_info() and send_data() immediately, implying that installation triggers data exfiltration. The hardcoded URL pointing to an external IP and the automatic collection and sending of potentially sensitive info constitute malicious behavior. Although the package claims to be for research purposes, the behavior aligns with malicious surveillance and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious intent by automatically collecting comprehensive system and network data upon installation and exfiltrating it to a remote server. The immediate execution of data collection and transmission, along with suspicious URL, indicates malicious surveillance activities. The package's description is misleading, and the behavior poses a significant security risk.",
