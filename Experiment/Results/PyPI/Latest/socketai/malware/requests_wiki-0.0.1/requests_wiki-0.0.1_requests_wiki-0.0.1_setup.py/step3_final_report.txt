{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect extensive system information, including hostname, IP addresses, username, geolocation, and potentially sensitive data, and exfiltrate it to a remote server immediately upon package installation or import, without user consent.",
  "sources": "The code reads system details via platform, socket, getpass, and requests modules; external API call to 'https://ipinfo.io' for geolocation; and performs network requests in send_data().",
  "sinks": "The external URL 'http://38.181.219.70:5000/report' where data is posted; data exfiltration occurs directly after setup(), transmitting sensitive info to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data is collected in get_system_info() from system modules and external API, then passed to send_data() which posts it to the hardcoded URL; this occurs immediately after setup() during module load.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of data collection and exfiltration upon package setup; use of suspicious external IP; comments indicating malicious intent; no user consent or notification; no obfuscation but behavior is clearly malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code collects detailed system info including geolocation and transmits it to an external server right after installation, with no user interaction. The URL is suspicious, indicating potential command-and-control or malicious data collection. Comments and package description suggest malicious intent. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but performs active malicious behavior. The high confidence in maliciousness is justified by the immediate exfiltration of sensitive data, external communication to a suspicious IP, and the context provided. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.9-1, security risk: 0.9-1, obfuscation: 0) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by automatically collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system information to an external server during or immediately after installation. The external URL and comments support malicious intent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and should be set to maximum (1.0). The code is not obfuscated. Overall, this package represents a high-severity supply chain threat with active malicious activity.",
