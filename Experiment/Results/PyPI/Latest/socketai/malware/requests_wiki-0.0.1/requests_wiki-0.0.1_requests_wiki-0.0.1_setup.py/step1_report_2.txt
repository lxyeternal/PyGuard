  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to a remote server, potentially for malicious surveillance.",
  "sources": "Data sources include socket, platform, getpass, requests, subprocess modules, and external URL 'https://ipinfo.io'.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call to 'http://38.181.219.70:5000/report' can transmit collected data to an external server, possibly without user consent.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered via get_system_info() and then sent through send_data() to an external server after setup completes.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed system info, including hostname, IP addresses, user info, and geolocation, and sends it to an external IP address. The purpose appears disguised as research but includes potentially malicious data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules and defines a function to collect system info, including platform details, hostname, IP, user info, and geolocation via an external API. It then defines a function to send this info to a specified remote server. The setup() function mimics a package configuration, with a note indicating malicious intent. After setup, the script immediately collects and sends system info. The code appears designed to gather comprehensive system data and exfiltrate it without user knowledge, fitting typical surveillance or data theft patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is intentionally designed to collect extensive system information and send it to an external server under the guise of a benign package setup, indicating malicious intent. The data collection and exfiltration are done covertly, which suggests the code is malicious.",
