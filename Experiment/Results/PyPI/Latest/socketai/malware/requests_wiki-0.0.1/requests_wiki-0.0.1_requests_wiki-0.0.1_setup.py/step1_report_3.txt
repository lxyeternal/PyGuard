{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information and send it to a remote server, potentially for malicious surveillance or data exfiltration purposes.",
  "sources": "Data sources include platform module (system info), socket (hostname, IP), getpass (username), requests (public IP, geolocation), and the get_system_info() function, which gathers all this data.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST request to a hardcoded remote URL in the send_data() function.",
  "flows": "Data is collected in get_system_info() and passed to send_data(), which transmits it over the network to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The script collects detailed system and network information without user consent, and the description labels the package as malicious. The code comments and the 'long_description' explicitly mention malicious intent. The code is designed to exfiltrate data automatically after installation, which is suspicious. Usage of requests to send data to a remote IP is typical for malicious data theft.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules, including requests, and defines functions to gather extensive system information such as OS details, hostname, IP addresses, geolocation, and username. It then sends this data to a specified external server. The setup() configuration includes a description indicating malicious intent and specifies a post-installation action: collecting and transmitting system info. The code executes get_system_info() and send_data() immediately after defining setup(), implying the malicious activity occurs upon installation or import. The combination of system info collection, network communication to a suspicious IP, and explicit mention of malicious purpose indicates malicious behavior. There are no obfuscated parts, but the code’s behavior itself is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to covertly collect system and network information and send it to an external server, fitting the profile of malicious spyware or data exfiltration malware. It explicitly states its malicious purpose in the package description, and the immediate data collection and transmission after setup suggest malicious intent.",
