  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by automatically collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system information to an external server during or immediately after installation. The external URL and comments support malicious intent. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and should be set to maximum (1.0). The code is not obfuscated. Overall, this package represents a high-severity supply chain threat with active malicious activity."
