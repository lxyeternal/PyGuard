  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It reads `README.md` with `open(\"README.md\").read()` without exception handling, which is common but could cause errors if the file is missing.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- Entry points are standard for CLI tools.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external network activity, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as benign, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Also finds the script legitimate, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Notes the lack of exception handling in `open()`, but considers it typical and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; the lack of exception handling isn't malicious but could be improved.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Same as others; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking scores:\n- All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- No report claims any malicious behavior, and none is evident.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `open()` without exception handling, but this is common in setup scripts and not malicious.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe setup script is a standard, benign package configuration. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores reflect this accurately.",
