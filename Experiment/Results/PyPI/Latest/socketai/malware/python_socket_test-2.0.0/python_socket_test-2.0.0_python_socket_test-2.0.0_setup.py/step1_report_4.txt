{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'python_socket_test'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description, uses 'find_packages()' to include packages, and specifies entry points for console scripts.",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no suspicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' to read 'README.md' without exception handling; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python 'setup.py' configuration using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for the long description, finds packages automatically, specifies minimum Python version, and defines a console script entry point. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. There are no hardcoded credentials or malicious code elements. The usage of 'open' without exception handling is typical for setup scripts and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate configuration for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided code. It is a standard, benign setup configuration.",
