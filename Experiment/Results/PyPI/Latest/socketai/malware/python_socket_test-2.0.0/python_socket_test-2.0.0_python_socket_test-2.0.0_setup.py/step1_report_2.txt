  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'python_socket_test' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the long description from 'README.md' and defines package metadata and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' to include as long description, then proceeds with standard package setup flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard setuptools functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script utilizing setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is typical and not suspicious. The entry point 'init' points to a main function within the package, which is a standard pattern. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior observed. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and standard for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
