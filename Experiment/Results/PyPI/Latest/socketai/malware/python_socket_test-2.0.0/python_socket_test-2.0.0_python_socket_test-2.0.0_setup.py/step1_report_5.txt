  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for 'python_socket_test' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' content during setup; no other data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of open('README.md').read() in setup script is common but can be risky if the file contains malicious content or is manipulated, though in this context it appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script employs standard setup configurations for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the long description from a markdown file, which is typical. No input validation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. The entry point indicates a CLI command linked to 'python_socket_test.main:main'. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent are detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package without any malicious or suspicious behaviors. It appears to serve its intended purpose of packaging the project safely.",
