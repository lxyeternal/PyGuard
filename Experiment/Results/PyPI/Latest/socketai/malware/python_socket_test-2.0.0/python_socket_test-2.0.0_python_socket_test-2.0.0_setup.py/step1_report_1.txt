{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'python_socket_test' Python module.",
  "sources": "The 'open(\"README.md\").read()' call reads the content of the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The setup process uses the package metadata; no untrusted data sinks are apparent within this code.",
  "flows": "The flow is from reading the README.md file (source) to including it in package metadata during setup (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of open(\"README.md\").read() without error handling could lead to runtime errors if the file is missing, but not malicious. No suspicious code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata, version, and entry points. It reads the README.md file for the long description, which is a common practice. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious or suspicious behavior are evident. The script's structure is straightforward and aligns with typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, performing standard package configuration without any malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior; it is a typical setup configuration for a Python package.",
