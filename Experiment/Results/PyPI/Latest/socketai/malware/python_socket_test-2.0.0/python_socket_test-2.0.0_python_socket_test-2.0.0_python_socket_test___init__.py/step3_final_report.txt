  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code and reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, network/system calls, environment variables, hardcoded credentials or URLs, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write/read operations, system command executions, environment variable access, eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or network data flow into system commands or data exfiltration points; environment variables or hardcoded secrets flow into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (e.g., eval/exec with obfuscated variables), suspicious network calls to untrusted domains, hardcoded IPs or URLs, dynamic code execution, unsafe data flows, absence of documentation or code clarity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation with dynamic execution patterns, suspicious network activity, and potential data exfiltration points. These indicators suggest malicious intent, especially if eval/exec are used with obfuscated variables, and network calls target untrusted domains. Absence of such patterns or benign code structures would lower suspicion. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, obfuscation ~0.75, risk ~0.75) are consistent with these findings. Reports lacking suspicious features are appropriately scored low. The overall assessment indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior in the most suspicious reports, justified by the described indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses, with high suspicion justified in reports highlighting obfuscation and malicious indicators. Low scores in benign or indeterminate cases are appropriate. Overall, the dependency exhibits a high security threat level, warranting caution.",
