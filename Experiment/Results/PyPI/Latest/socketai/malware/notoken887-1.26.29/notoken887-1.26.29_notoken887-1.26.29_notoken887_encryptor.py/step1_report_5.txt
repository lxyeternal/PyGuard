{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple substitution-based encryption and decryption for strings, replacing characters with emojis and vice versa.",
  "sources": "Input data is expected from method parameters 'string' and 'encrypted_token'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communications are present; the methods return transformed data.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through sequential replacements, transforming characters to emojis and back.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward substitution without obfuscation. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behaviors are evident. There are no external calls, network operations, or environment variable manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs character substitution for encryption/decryption using the replace() method. It uses fixed mappings, which are clearly defined and static. The structure is simple and does not involve dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The purpose appears to be basic encoding/decoding for obfuscation, not malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution cipher with no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security threats. It is a straightforward implementation of encoding and decoding routines. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
