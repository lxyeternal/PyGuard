{
  "purpose": "This class provides methods to encode and decode strings by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa, serving as a simple reversible obfuscation or encoding scheme.",
  "sources": "The code reads input strings via the 'encrypt' method and encrypted tokens via the 'decrypt' method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any direct output operations, network communications, or data exfiltration. It only performs string replacements.",
  "flows": "Input string -> 'encrypt' method -> character replacements -> output encrypted string; Encrypted string -> 'decrypt' method -> reverse character replacements -> output original string.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward character replacement without any obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external dependencies. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. No input validation or security checks are performed, but given its simple nature, it does not seem malicious. No system calls, network operations, or data leakage mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The class implements a reversible encoding scheme by substituting characters with emojis and back. It operates solely on string replacement, which is deterministic and predictable. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns such as network communication, file access, or hidden backdoors. The use of emojis does not inherently introduce security risks or malicious intent. No anomalies, obfuscated code techniques, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears benign, functioning as an encoding or obfuscation tool.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple reversible character substitution scheme intended for obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility with no security concerns.",
