  "purpose": "A simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding strings with emojis representing characters",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to encrypt() and encrypted tokens passed to decrypt()",
  "sinks": "Return statements outputting the transformed strings",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed character-by-character via replace() calls in encrypt() and decrypt() methods",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected; the code only performs straightforward character replacements",
  "analysis": "The class provides a reversible substitution cipher using emoji replacements for alphanumeric and some special characters. Both methods perform extensive sequential replace() calls, which are deterministic and do not involve dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks. No obfuscated code patterns, hidden behaviors, or suspicious code structures are present. The code's purpose appears solely to encode and decode data through substitution, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a basic, reversible substitution cipher solely for encoding and decoding purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities within this module. It appears to be a benign utility class.",
