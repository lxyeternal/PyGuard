{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple character replacement-based encryption and decryption functions for transforming strings into a symbolic representation and vice versa.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'string' parameter in 'encrypt' and from 'encrypted_token' parameter in 'decrypt'.",
  "sinks": "The code performs string replacement operations; no external data sinks or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are transformed through a series of replace calls from characters to symbols (encrypt) and from symbols back to characters (decrypt).",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward string replacement for encryption without any cryptographic security, but there are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious functions. It does not perform network operations, file access, or system commands.",
  "analysis": "The implementation is a basic character substitution cipher that replaces each character with a unique symbol and vice versa. The replacements are hardcoded, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code lacks obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or secret keys. Its purpose appears to be simple obfuscation rather than secure encryption, with no malicious behavior observed. No external inputs, system calls, or potential data leaks are present. The functions are isolated and only manipulate string data with static mappings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward character substitution cipher used for obfuscation. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to serve only to obscure data in a reversible manner. No malicious intent or security threats are detected.",
