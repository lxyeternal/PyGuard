{
  "purpose": "The class provides simple encoding and decoding (encryption/decryption) by substituting characters with emojis and other symbols.",
  "sources": "Input strings to the encrypt() and decrypt() methods.",
  "sinks": "The methods output transformed strings; no external data sources or untrusted data inputs are directly involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> replace() substitutions -> output encrypted string; Encrypted string -> replace() substitutions -> output decrypted string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of extensive character replacement with emojis and symbols is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs character substitution for encoding and decoding purposes, using .replace() chains to map characters to emojis and symbols and vice versa. There are no network operations, no file I/O, no environment variable usage, or external data sources. The code is straightforward and appears to serve as a simple obfuscation method rather than malicious activity. No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are detected. The substitutions are static and self-contained. Given the simplicity and lack of external interactions, the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign character substitution cipher for obfuscation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations, data leakage, or network activity. It appears to be a simple encoding utility rather than malicious code.",
