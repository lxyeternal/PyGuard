  "purpose": "Testing SSH connection isolation, thread safety, and remote command execution on localhost using local dictionary file.",
  "sources": "Local dictionary file (/usr/share/dict/words); SSH commands executed via cxn.run()",
  "sinks": "Processing command output locally; no external data exfiltration or network activity",
  "flows": "Reading local data, executing commands over SSH, collecting and verifying output",
  "anomalies": "Use of skip() for some tests, multiple SSH connections to localhost, threading; typical for testing, not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code establishes multiple SSH connections to localhost, runs shell commands ('tail', 'head') on a local words file, and verifies connection independence and thread safety. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are detected. The commands are constructed with controlled data, and no untrusted input influences command execution. The threading and connection handling appear correct. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign, controlled testing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility focused on SSH connection management and concurrency, with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities detected. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the low risk score reflects minimal threat in this controlled environment.",
