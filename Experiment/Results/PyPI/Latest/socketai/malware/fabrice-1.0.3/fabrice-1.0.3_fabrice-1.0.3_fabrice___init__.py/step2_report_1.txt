  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a set of import statements from internal modules such as `_version`, `connection`, `runners`, `group`, `tasks`, and `executor`. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing within this snippet. The purpose appears to be to expose or organize core functionalities of a larger package.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Indicators**  \nNo report mentions any suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and typical for a package's `__init__.py` or main module.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Scores**  \nAll reports assign very low or zero scores for malware and security risk, which is appropriate given the code. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the consensus that this code is benign.\n\n4. **Inconsistencies or Errors**  \n- The reports are consistent and align well with the code's simplicity.  \n- The only minor point is the first report assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, which might be slightly high given the benign nature, but it's still very low and acceptable.\n\n5. **Potential Over- or Under-Scoring**  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.  \n- The risk scores are very low, matching the benign assessment.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n- The suppression of style warnings (`flake8: noqa`) is standard and does not imply malicious intent.  \n- Since the code is purely import statements, there's no basis for higher risk scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the analysis, the reports are accurate. The code is a standard, benign module import setup with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal, mostly due to the suppression comment, but negligible in context)\n\nThis code fragment is essentially a benign module initializer, typical in Python packages, with no security issues.\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the broader context of the entire package, but based solely on this snippet, there are no security risks.",
