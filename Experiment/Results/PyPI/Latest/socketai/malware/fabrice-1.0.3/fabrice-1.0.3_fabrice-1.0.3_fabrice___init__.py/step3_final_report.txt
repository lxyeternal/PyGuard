  "purpose": "Module initialization and organization of core package functionalities via import statements.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A — static import statements without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'flake8: noqa' comment; no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules, typical for a package's __init__.py. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The only minor inconsistency is a securityRisk score of 0.1 in one report, which should be 0, aligning with the benign assessment. Overall, the code is a standard, safe module setup with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of import statements serving as a package initializer. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior is present. The scores should be uniformly zero for malware and obfuscation, with a security risk score of 0. The assessments are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
