  "purpose": "The code is a testing script utilizing Fabric to run benign commands on specified hosts, primarily for testing remote command execution and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded hostnames ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', 'nopebadhost1', 'nopebadhost2') and commands ('echo foo', 'lolnope').",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'group.run()' commands on specified hosts; no untrusted data flows into critical operations.",
  "flows": "Static commands executed on hardcoded hosts; exception handling captures expected errors without data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code structure is straightforward and intended for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs controlled remote command execution with benign commands and proper exception handling. No untrusted input influences execution, and no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The security implications are minimal, and the code's behavior aligns with standard testing scripts. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward testing utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores accurately reflect its safe nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
