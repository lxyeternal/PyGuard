{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2' based on environment variables and directory structure, configuring dependencies and entry points for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), filesystem checks (os.path.isdir), reading version info from a file, reading README content, and defining package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "Executing the setup() function from setuptools, which uses the collected configuration to package the project.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package naming; reading version and README content provides data for package metadata; finally, setup() uses these inputs to prepare the package.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution beyond straightforward exec() of a version file, which is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: importing modules, determining package version via exec(), conditional package naming based on environment and directory presence, reading README content, and calling setuptools.setup() with appropriate arguments. The use of exec() to load version info is common in setup scripts. The environment variable influences package selection but does not execute or load untrusted code. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. Dependencies are explicitly listed and do not appear suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It dynamically configures package names and dependencies based on environment and filesystem state. Overall, it is benign and performs standard package configuration tasks.",
