    "No direct code injection or malicious payload detected.",
    "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors evident."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages package setup configurations, environment detection, and package metadata. It reads environment variables and filesystem info to determine package versioning and naming. The use of exec() to evaluate '_version.py' is standard for setup scripts but could be risky if the file contents are malicious, although typical in package setup. No code shows malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The script does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system compromise operations. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It uses environment variables, filesystem checks, and executes a version file for setup purposes, which is typical. There are no suspicious or malicious operations detected.",
