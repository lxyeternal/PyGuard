      "conclusion": "The code is a typical build/deployment script with significant security mispractices due to embedded secrets. There is no malware or malicious intent detected. The security risk stems from the hardcoded credentials, which could be exploited if exposed. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, but the risk score should be increased to approximately 0.6 to reflect the security vulnerability."

The environment variable handling is standard but could be improved for clarity. Overall, the script poses minimal security risk."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, consistent with the analysis."
