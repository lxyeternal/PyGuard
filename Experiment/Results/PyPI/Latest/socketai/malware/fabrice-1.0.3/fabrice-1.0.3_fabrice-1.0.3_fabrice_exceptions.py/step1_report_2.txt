  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code only defines exception classes without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears straightforward with standard class definitions and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. All are standard Python exceptions with no embedded logic, data processing, or external data handling. The comments suggest some potential future refactoring or code organization but do not indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines exception classes without any malicious or security-related issues. It appears to be part of a larger project to handle specific error conditions cleanly. No security risks or malware are detected.",
