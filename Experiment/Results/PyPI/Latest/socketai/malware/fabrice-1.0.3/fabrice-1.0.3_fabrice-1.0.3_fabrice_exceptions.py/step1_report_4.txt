  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python project, including 'NothingToDo', 'GroupException', and 'InvalidV1Env'.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or external data access in the provided code).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data handling or external output within this code).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines exceptions).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code contains comments about potential future refactoring but nothing malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, each inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. These classes are used for specific error handling related to group processing and environment configuration. There are no input sources, no data flow, no external interactions, and no security-sensitive operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. It is purely structural and intended for error handling within a larger application context.",
