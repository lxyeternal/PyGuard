{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and grouping results in a Python project, likely related to task management or orchestration.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and docstrings, no input reading or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code contains only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The comments suggest modularity and potential future refactoring, but nothing malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. Each class inherits from Exception and is used for specific error handling scenarios. There are no active data flows, no input or output operations, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The comments indicate intentions for code organization but do not introduce security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign and purely consists of exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.",
