  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to group results and environment issues.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes without input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with minimal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three simple exception class definitions with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The classes are standard and do not include any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code aligns with best practices for defining custom exceptions. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of standard exception class definitions with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified, and no further action is necessary.",
