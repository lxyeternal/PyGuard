  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a Python project, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reads; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class definitions do not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of standard exception class definitions with no unusual constructs or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. All are straightforward, inheriting from Exception, and contain no executable code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious patterns. The comments indicate intended usage context but do not reveal any malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be standard, safe, and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves as part of a larger codebase for error handling. No anomalies or security concerns are present.",
