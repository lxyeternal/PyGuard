  "purpose": "Build, test, documentation, and release automation tasks for a Python project, primarily managing packaging and deployment workflows.",
  "sources": "Internal configuration parameters, environment variables, hardcoded credentials, and system paths.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls (`c.run()`), environment modifications, file uploads, and connection configurations.",
  "flows": "Credentials and environment variables influence subprocess execution, environment setup, and connection parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded passwords ('sikrit', 'localghost', 'admin', 'mypass'), manipulation of `sys.path`, and static environment configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build and deployment tasks with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is the hardcoded credentials, which could lead to credential exposure if the code is shared or compromised. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious data flows are detected. The code structure is straightforward, and no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build/deployment script with significant security mispractices due to embedded secrets. There is no malware or malicious intent detected. The security risk stems from the hardcoded credentials, which could be exploited if exposed. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation is 0, but the risk score should be increased to approximately 0.6 to reflect the security vulnerability.",
