  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines build, test, documentation, and release tasks. Sources are internal, no untrusted input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident malicious data flow; subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** The only security concern is the hardcoded password 'sikrit' in `sanity_test_from_v1`.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate build script with low risk; the hardcoded password is a concern but not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior) — **appropriate**  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — **appropriate**  \n- Risk: 0.3 — reasonable, given the password issue but no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build/release tasks. Notably, it mentions hardcoded credentials ('password':'sikrit') and configuration data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Credentials are set directly in code; `release.upload` could be a concern if misused.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, which are security risks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, but significant security risk due to embedded secrets.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct, no malware detected  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate  \n- Risk: 0.6 — justified due to hardcoded secrets and insecure practices.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build/test automation with environment variables and hardcoded credentials (`env.password='sikrit'`).\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Credentials influence connection configs; potential for credential leakage.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded credentials, environment variable manipulations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malware, but insecure handling of secrets.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate  \n- Risk: 0.6 — justified due to hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build/test tasks, with environment variables and credentials.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Credentials used in connection configs; no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded password 'sikrit' again.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, but insecure credential management.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct  \n- Risk: 0.3 — appropriate, given the embedded secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build/deploy script, with hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'localghost', 'admin').\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Credentials influence environment and connections; no malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, potential for credential exposure.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malware, but insecure practices.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct  \n- Risk: 0.4 — justified due to hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is primarily automation with embedded secrets.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally high due to embedded secrets and insecure practices.\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.6** — high due to hardcoded credentials, which pose security vulnerabilities if exposed or misused.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard build/deploy script with no malware but notable security concerns stemming from embedded secrets. The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
