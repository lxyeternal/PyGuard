  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of potentially malicious remote monitoring or data exfiltration tools, primarily due to obfuscation and covert network activity. While no explicit malicious payloads are detected, the obfuscation and communication patterns warrant caution. The malware score is set at 0.5, reflecting moderate suspicion; obfuscation is high (0.9), and overall security risk is elevated (0.7). Further analysis is recommended to confirm intent."
