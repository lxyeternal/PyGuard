      "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if 'main()' contains harmful code. The current malware scores are underestimated; they should be increased to at least 0.7 to reflect the security risk. The overall security risk should be elevated accordingly. No obfuscation is detected, so obfuscated score remains 0."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains, indicating high malicious potential primarily related to privacy invasion and tracking. While no active payloads or obfuscation are present, the behavior warrants a malware score around 0.6–0.75 and a security risk score approximately 0.75–0.8. The activity is consistent with malicious or privacy-invasive intent, justifying high alert levels."
