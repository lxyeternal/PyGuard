  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if 'main()' contains harmful code. The current malware scores are underestimated; they should be increased to at least 0.7 to reflect the security risk. The overall security risk should be elevated accordingly. No obfuscation is detected, so obfuscated score remains 0."
