  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which makes HTTP requests to external URLs with sensitive data as query parameters.",
  "flows": "Source functions gather data -> data is encoded or formatted -> URL constructed with data as query parameters -> urlopen() sends data over network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses, multiple URLs, no validation of URLs, and data sent as GET parameters which could be used for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system-specific information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses using platform and system commands. It then encodes MAC addresses in base64. The script constructs URLs with this information as parameters, including a random number for each request. It sends requests to multiple external URLs, which appear suspicious due to their unconventional domain names (possibly indicative of command-and-control or tracking servers). The data transmission is passive and lacks any form of encryption beyond URL encoding, and there are no responses or further processing, suggesting data exfiltration or tracking intent. The use of hardcoded URLs and encoding techniques points to potentially malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. No obfuscation or malicious system modifications are present; the behavior aligns with data harvesting or tracking scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system info and sends it to external servers, which is suspicious. While it does not perform destructive actions, the behavior resembles a data exfiltration or tracking mechanism. The URLs are suspicious, and the data collection and transmission patterns could be malicious or privacy-invasive.",
