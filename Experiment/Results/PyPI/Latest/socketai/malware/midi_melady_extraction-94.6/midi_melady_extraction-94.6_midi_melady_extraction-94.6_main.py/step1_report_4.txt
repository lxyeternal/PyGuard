{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, encodes the MAC addresses, and sends this data to predefined URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (`platform.node()`), username (`getpass.getuser()`), current working directory (`os.getcwd()`), and MAC addresses (`get_mac_addresses()` function).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with collected data as URL parameters using `urllib.request.urlopen()`.",
  "flows": "Data sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) are gathered and encoded; this data is then included in URL parameters and transmitted via network requests to multiple external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names and sends potentially sensitive system information without user consent. No explicit user prompts or logs, and no validation or obfuscation beyond base64 encoding. The URL domains are potentially malicious or used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves system info including hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory. It encodes MAC addresses with base64. It then constructs URLs with this data and sends HTTP GET requests to predefined external servers. The URLs are suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration. The code does not include any user prompts, validation, or encryption beyond base64. No clear malicious payload such as executing commands, malware installation, or backdoors is present. However, the transmission of system info to external servers, especially with suspicious domains, is indicative of potential privacy invasion or covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect and send system information to external domains, which could be used for malicious tracking or data theft. While it does not execute malicious payloads or commands, the data collection and transmission without user consent raises security and privacy concerns. It has a high likelihood of being malicious or maliciously intended.",
