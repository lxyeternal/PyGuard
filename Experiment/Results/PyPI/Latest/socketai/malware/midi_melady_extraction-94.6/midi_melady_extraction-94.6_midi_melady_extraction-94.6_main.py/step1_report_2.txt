{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then encodes and transmits this data to a set of remote URLs.",
  "sources": "System calls to retrieve MAC addresses ('getmac' and 'ifconfig'), platform module for hostname, getpass for username, os for current directory, and random for generating a number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests with system data embedded in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into URL parameters which are then sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple system-dependent commands to extract MAC addresses, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and consistent transmission of collected data to external domains. The URLs used are suspicious and do not belong to legitimate services. The inclusion of multiple URLs and encoding indicates an intent to obfuscate data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to multiple remote servers via GET requests. The URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious. The data collection could facilitate device fingerprinting or tracking. There are no signs of code obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors are detected. The data transmission pattern and the nature of the URLs suggest malicious intent, possibly for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is collecting system information and transmitting it to suspicious external servers without user consent. The use of suspicious URLs and systematic data exfiltration points toward malicious behavior. The overall risk is high due to potential privacy invasion and data exfiltration.",
