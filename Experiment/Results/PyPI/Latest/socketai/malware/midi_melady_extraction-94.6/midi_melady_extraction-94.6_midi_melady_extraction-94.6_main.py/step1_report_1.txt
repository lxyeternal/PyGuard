  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system commands, random.randint(), base64 encoding.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls with constructed URLs containing collected data.",
  "flows": "System info sources are encoded and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and network requests without validation or user consent. No explicit input validation or user prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory. MAC addresses are retrieved via system commands and then encoded in base64. It then constructs URLs to three external domains, appending collected data as URL parameters, and makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs. The external domains appear suspicious and possibly malicious, especially considering their unusual naming and obfuscated data transmission. The code does not handle responses or errors meaningfully, indicating a focus on covert data exfiltration. No obvious malicious payload like file modifications, command execution, or privilege escalation is present, but the data collection and transmission behavior are characteristic of potentially malicious activity, particularly for information gathering and exfiltration in malicious scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects and transmits system information to external suspicious domains without user consent, indicating malicious intent related to data exfiltration. Although no direct harmful payload is evident, the network activity and obfuscation suggest potentially malicious behavior.",
