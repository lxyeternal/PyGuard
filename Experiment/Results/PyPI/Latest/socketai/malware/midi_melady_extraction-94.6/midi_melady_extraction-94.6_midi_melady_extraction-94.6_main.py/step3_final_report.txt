{
  "purpose": "The code collects system hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to suspicious external URLs for potential covert data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system info, and the URL parameters in the network requests.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls transmitting data to external domains without validation or encryption, potentially leading to data leakage or covert communication.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into URL parameters (hostname, username, current_path, base64-encoded MACs), which are sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious URLs, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, lack of user consent prompts, no validation of responses, and passive data collection without obfuscation or payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script passively collects sensitive system information, encodes MAC addresses, and transmits this data to external servers without user consent or validation. The URLs are suspicious, indicating potential covert data exfiltration or tracking. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and contains no malicious payloads like code execution or file modifications. The network activity and data collection patterns are characteristic of privacy-invasive or malicious surveillance tools. The lack of obfuscation and payload suggests the behavior is intentional but not actively destructive. The data exfiltration to suspicious domains justifies high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains, indicating high malicious potential primarily related to privacy invasion and tracking. While no active payloads or obfuscation are present, the behavior warrants a malware score around 0.6–0.75 and a security risk score approximately 0.75–0.8. The activity is consistent with malicious or privacy-invasive intent, justifying high alert levels.",
