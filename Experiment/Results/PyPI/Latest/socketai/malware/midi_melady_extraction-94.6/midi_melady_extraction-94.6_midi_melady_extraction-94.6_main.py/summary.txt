  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains, indicating high malicious potential primarily related to privacy invasion and tracking. While no active payloads or obfuscation are present, the behavior warrants a malware score around 0.6–0.75 and a security risk score approximately 0.75–0.8. The activity is consistent with malicious or privacy-invasive intent, justifying high alert levels."
