  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing the 'tronyx' library.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file, static strings for package metadata, dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "Static data from file read and hardcoded strings; no data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and typical for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and pathlib, reads a local README.md for long description, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The code is standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The only minor note is a misplaced comment about a comma, which does not affect functionality. All security signals indicate a benign script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious, suspicious, or security-risk behavior. All signals confirm its safety and correctness.",
