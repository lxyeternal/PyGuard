  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe a single, straightforward import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n- None of the reports indicate any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The import is a common Python practice for modular code organization.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external communications are observed.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1), consistent with the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Specific Analysis:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms benign, straightforward import.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar conclusion.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.8), but justified given the minimal code.\n- No malware or security risks.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above.\n- Confidence: 1\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.4), possibly due to the mention of limited context.\n- Slightly higher security risk (0.1), but given the minimal code, this seems overstated.\n- No malware.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- High confidence (0.9).\n- No malware or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Scores:\n- **Malware:** All zero, consistent with the benign code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero, no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are generally appropriate.\n- For report 4, the security risk could be lowered from 0.1 to 0, as there's no evidence of any risk, especially since the code is a simple import.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is indicated.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a basic import statement with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The risk and malware scores are correctly assigned as zero.\n- The minor uncertainties are due to lack of context, but based on the provided snippet, the benign assessment is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code snippet and aligns with the detailed assessments provided.",
