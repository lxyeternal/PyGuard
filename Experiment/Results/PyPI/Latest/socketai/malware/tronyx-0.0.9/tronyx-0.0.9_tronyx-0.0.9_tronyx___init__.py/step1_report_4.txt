{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific attribute or function named 'perm' from a module named 'main' within the same package or directory.",
  "sources": "Import statement that reads the 'perm' attribute or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Imports 'perm' from 'main', but no further data flow or execution is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with no additional context; potential for malicious behavior cannot be determined from this alone. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, which is a common practice in Python to include functionality from other modules within the same package. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns. Since this is only a single line, it does not reveal any malicious behavior or security risks. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to assess malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, though limited in scope. Further code context would be needed for a comprehensive security assessment.",
