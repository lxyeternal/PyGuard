  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms a simple import of 'perm' from 'main'.\n- No data sinks, flows, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: benign.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign and straightforward. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms import of 'perm' from 'main'.\n- No data sinks, flows, anomalies.\n- Conclusion: benign.\n- Confidence: 0.8.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Also accurate. The minimal code poses no threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above, straightforward import.\n- No anomalies or malicious signs.\n- Conclusion: benign.\n- Confidence: 1.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.4), mentions minimal code, no suspicious patterns.\n- Notes that further context would be needed for a thorough assessment.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), possibly due to the cautious approach.\n\n**Assessment:** The cautious security risk score seems reasonable given the minimal context. The code itself remains benign; the low confidence reflects the limited scope.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, straightforward import.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- Confidence: 0.9.\n- Malware: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports or the code snippets suggest any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not observed; all code snippets are straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- **Risk scores:** All are very low or zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n- The code is just a simple import statement; on its own, it cannot be malicious.\n- Without further context—such as what 'perm' does, or how it's used—it's impossible to identify hidden malicious intent.\n- The cautious scores (like 0.1 or 0.2) in some reports are appropriate, but given the simplicity, even these could be zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** Should be 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Should remain 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Should be 0 or very close to 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Report | Original Malware Score | Recommended Malware Score | Original Risk Score | Recommended Risk Score |\n|---------|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| 1       | 0                       | 0                         | 0                     | 0                      |\n| 2       | 0                       | 0                         | 0                     | 0                      |\n| 3       | 0                       | 0                         | 0                     | 0                      |\n| 4       | 0                       | 0                         | 0.1                   | 0                      |\n| 5       | 0                       | 0                         | 0                     | 0                      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the scores should reflect that. No evidence suggests any malware or security risks.",
