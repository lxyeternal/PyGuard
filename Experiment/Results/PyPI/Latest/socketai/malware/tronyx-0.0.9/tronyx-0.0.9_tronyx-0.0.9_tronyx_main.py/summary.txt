  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior by leaking private keys to an external server without safeguards, indicating malicious or highly insecure intent. The consistent pattern across reports and the external communication suggest a significant security concern. The typo does not reduce the severity; scores of approximately 0.75 for malware and 0.8 for security risk are justified."
