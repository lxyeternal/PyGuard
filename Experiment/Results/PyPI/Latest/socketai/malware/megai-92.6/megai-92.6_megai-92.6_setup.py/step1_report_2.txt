  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install command that executes a function from an external module post-installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the CrazyInstallStrat class, which imports and executes 'main' from 'main' module during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' from 'main' module during install, which could potentially execute malicious code if 'main' is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, 'install.run(self)' executes, then 'from main import main' loads a function from an external module, followed by 'main()' being called.",
  "anomalies": "Custom install command triggers execution of external module code ('main') at install time, which is unusual and potentially risky. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to define package configuration. The custom class CrazyInstallStrat overrides 'run' to execute code from 'main' module after standard installation. The primary concern is the execution of 'main()' during install, which could run arbitrary code if 'main' contains malicious logic. No other suspicious or malicious patterns are present, but executing external code at install time is a notable security consideration. No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no indicators of malicious payloads aside from the external 'main' invocation.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a standard setup script with a custom install step that runs an external function. While this pattern is not inherently malicious, it could be exploited if 'main' contains malicious code. No other malicious indicators are observed, but the execution of external code during installation warrants caution.",
