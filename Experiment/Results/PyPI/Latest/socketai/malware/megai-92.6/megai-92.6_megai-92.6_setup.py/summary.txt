  "conclusion": "The setup code employs a risky pattern of executing 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code. The scores should reflect a moderate to high malicious potential and security risk, with a malware score around 0.5 and a security risk of approximately 0.75. This pattern should be flagged for review and avoided unless 'main()' is verified safe."
