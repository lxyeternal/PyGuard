  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'megai' Python package that customizes the installation process to execute a main() function after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, particularly the 'from main import main' inside the CrazyInstallStrat class's run method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function during installation, which may execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method calls main() from main module, executing potentially arbitrary code after setup.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class CrazyInstallStrat executes main() without any security checks or validation. The purpose of executing main() post-installation is unusual and potentially risky. No other suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with a custom installation class. The key concern is the run() method in CrazyInstallStrat, which imports and executes main() from main module during installation. This behavior can be exploited to execute arbitrary code during package installation, especially if the main module contains malicious code or is modified maliciously. The rest of the setup script appears typical, with dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil'. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are evident outside the post-installation code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior where it executes main() from an external module during installation, which could be exploited to run malicious code. This practice is suspicious and could lead to arbitrary code execution upon package installation.",
