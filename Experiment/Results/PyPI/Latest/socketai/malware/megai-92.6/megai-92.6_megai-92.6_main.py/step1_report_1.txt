  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory, and generate a random number, then send this data to a set of external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function, random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, path, MAC addresses, random number) are encoded and included as URL parameters, then sent to external servers via HTTP GET requests",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding on MAC addresses, construction of URLs with user/system data sent over HTTP, use of multiple suspicious external domains, no data validation or encryption beyond base64, no clear user consent or transparency",
  "analysis": "The script collects host system info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) and encodes the MAC addresses with base64. It generates a random number to vary requests. Data is sent via HTTP GET requests to three external domains that are suspicious and likely malicious. The code does not validate responses, and the external domains do not appear trustworthy. The data transmission pattern suggests possible data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities. No malicious payload execution or backdoors are present, but the data collection and transmission behavior are privacy-invasive and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect system information and transmit it to suspicious external domains without user consent, indicating malicious or at least privacy-invading behavior. It is highly likely designed for tracking or data exfiltration purposes.",
