  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64, likely for tracking or profiling purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system interfaces, random.randint() generating an identifier.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to external URLs, base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) collected from sources → encoded (MAC addresses) → appended as URL parameters → sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains, base64 encoding MAC addresses, multiple URLs in a list, silent exception handling during network requests, no validation or encryption of transmitted data.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific identifiers such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs with these parameters. The URLs appear to be suspicious, possibly malicious, given their domain names and structure. Data is transmitted via HTTP GET requests without any encryption or user consent, which could facilitate tracking or data exfiltration. No malicious code execution or backdoors are present, but the data collection and transmission pattern is indicative of tracking or potential malicious surveillance. The silent handling of network exceptions may also hide failed attempts to exfiltrate data. Overall, the code's intent appears to be tracking or profiling the user system without disclosure.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior consistent with user tracking or profiling, transmitting system identifiers to suspicious external domains. While it does not perform malicious actions like data theft or system modification, its secretive data collection and external communication pose security and privacy concerns.",
