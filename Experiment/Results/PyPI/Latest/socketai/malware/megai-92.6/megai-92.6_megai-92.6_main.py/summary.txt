  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious external domains, indicating malicious intent. The current malware scores in some reports are underestimated; they should be increased to reflect the high suspicion of malicious activity. Obfuscation is absent, but the activity's privacy-invasive nature warrants high risk and malware suspicion scores. Overall, the script should be considered highly malicious in behavior, with a malware score around 0.8 and a security risk score of approximately 0.75."
