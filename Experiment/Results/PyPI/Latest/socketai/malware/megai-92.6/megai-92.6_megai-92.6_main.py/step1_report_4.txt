  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname; getpass.getuser() for username; os.getcwd() for current directory; get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "flows": "Collected system info (hostname, username, current directory, base64-encoded MAC addresses) flows from source functions into URL parameters, then transmitted over the network to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external URLs with suspicious domains; encoding MAC addresses in base64; sending system information without user consent; no validation or encryption of transmitted data; generic exception handling that suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers various system identifiers including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, then sends the collected info via HTTP GET requests. The use of suspicious domains suggests potential command-and-control or data exfiltration purpose. The lack of user consent prompts concern. The code does not perform any malicious payload execution but appears designed to collect and transmit system info stealthily. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are present beyond the suspicious domains and data transmission pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a data collection agent that transmits system information to external suspicious domains, potentially for malicious purposes like tracking or exfiltration. While it does not execute malicious payloads or perform destructive actions, its intent to silently send system details without user approval is suspicious and warrants caution.",
