{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via HTTP GET requests to specified external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which reads system network interfaces), and the constructed URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url), which sends HTTP requests with potentially sensitive data embedded in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and MAC addresses) are encoded and included as URL parameters; data flows from collection functions through encoding to URL construction, then sent via HTTP GET to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded external URLs that appear suspicious and potentially malicious; encoding of MAC addresses in base64 could be used to obscure data. The URLs point to domains that may be used for data exfiltration or command and control. The script collects system info and transmits it without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers various system identifiers such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to obscure their content. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to external domains, which are suspicious due to their unconventional domains and the lack of any user interaction or opt-in. The data transmission is silent, which is typical of potentially malicious information exfiltration. The use of exception handling suppresses errors, preventing detection of failures in network communication. Overall, the script's behavior resembles data collection for tracking or malicious purposes, especially considering the suspicious external domains and obfuscated MAC addresses.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it covertly to external servers, which is characteristic of malicious data exfiltration or surveillance. The use of suspicious URLs and encoding techniques increases suspicion. The script could be part of a malicious package aiming to gather user/system data without consent.",
