While no active malicious actions are demonstrated, the obfuscation tactics and URL patterns justify high suspicion. The scores should reflect this, with malware and risk scores elevated but acknowledging the lack of confirmed malicious payloads."

The primary concern is a logical flaw in transaction tracking, which does not impact security. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the detailed analysis and multiple reports."

While cryptographic routines are standard, their combination with exec() and URL handling suggests a high potential for malicious exploitation. The overall security risk and malware likelihood are high, warranting caution and further analysis."

The evidence justifies a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and security risk score of 1, indicating a high probability of malicious intent and severe security threat."
