  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious activity, including heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and potential for arbitrary system commands. The high scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified. It should be treated as highly suspicious and warrants further review or removal."
