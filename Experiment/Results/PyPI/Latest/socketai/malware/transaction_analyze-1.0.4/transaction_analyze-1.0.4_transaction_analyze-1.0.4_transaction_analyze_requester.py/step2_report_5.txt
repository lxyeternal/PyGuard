  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description; monitors wallets via blockchain.info API, logs to file.\n- **Sinks:** Logs, console output, sound notification.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses an infinite loop, which is typical for monitoring; the 'requester' function is unused.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; standard API calls, logging, and notifications.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate wallet monitoring; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies no malicious activity. The low risk score aligns with the benign analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; monitors wallets, fetches data from blockchain.info.\n- **Anomalies:** Unused 'requester' function, but harmless.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard operations.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate monitoring tool.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general functionality; monitors wallets, plays sounds.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses an infinite loop; plays sounds without validation; 'requester' unused.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; the sound file path is hardcoded but benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; standard monitoring.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar; monitors wallets, logs, plays sounds.\n- **Anomalies:** 'processed_transactions' is re-initialized each call, leading to potential duplicate notifications, but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; the re-initialization issue is a logic flaw, not a security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a minor logic inefficiency.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Monitors wallets, logs, plays sounds.\n- **Anomalies:** 'processed_transactions' is local to each loop iteration, so transaction detection may be unreliable; hardcoded sound file.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; functionality is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, but with a logical flaw in transaction tracking.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, risk 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Assessment:** The minor flaw doesn't imply malicious intent. The risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not observed.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** Low (0.2), justified by the benign nature of operations.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n- The only notable issue is the logic flaw in transaction tracking ('processed_transactions' being re-initialized), but this does not impact security or malware assessment.\n- The 'requester' function's unused status is harmless but suggests incomplete code.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minimal, standard wallet monitoring.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No significant security concerns or malware risks are present.",
