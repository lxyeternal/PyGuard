{
  "purpose": "Monitor specified Bitcoin wallets for balance changes and new transactions, logging events and playing notification sounds.",
  "sources": "API responses from https://blockchain.info/rawaddr/{wallet_address}, reading wallet data and transaction details.",
  "sinks": "Console output, log file writes, sound notification playback, in-memory transaction tracking.",
  "flows": "API response data -> parse JSON -> detect balance/transaction changes -> log and notify -> update wallet state.",
  "anomalies": "Re-initialization of 'processed_transactions' set within each loop iteration, leading to potential repeated notifications for the same transactions; unused 'requester' function.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet monitoring functions: periodic API requests, balance and transaction change detection, logging, and notifications. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The 'processed_transactions' set is re-initialized each cycle, which is a logical flaw affecting detection accuracy but not security. The 'requester' function is unused, indicating leftover or incomplete code. The sound file path is hardcoded but not malicious. Overall, the script is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, reflecting minor logical inefficiencies but no security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard wallet monitoring script with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is a logical flaw in transaction tracking, which does not impact security. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, consistent with the detailed analysis and multiple reports.",
