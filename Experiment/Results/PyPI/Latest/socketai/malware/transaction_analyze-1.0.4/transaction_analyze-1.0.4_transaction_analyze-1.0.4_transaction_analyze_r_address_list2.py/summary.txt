  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity consistent with malicious payloads such as remote backdoors, data exfiltration tools, or command-and-control agents. The evidence justifies a malware score of 1, obfuscation score of 1, and security risk score of 1, indicating a high probability of malicious intent and severe security threat."
