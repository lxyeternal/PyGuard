  "purpose": "Configure and package a Python project named 'transaction_analyze' with its dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, which reads static package metadata and dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration code with no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "License specified as 'Python Script' which is unconventional; no other suspicious or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, author, license, and optional development dependencies. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution occurs. The license field contains a non-standard value, but this does not pose a security risk. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious instructions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The only minor concern is the unconventional license designation, but it does not impact security.",
