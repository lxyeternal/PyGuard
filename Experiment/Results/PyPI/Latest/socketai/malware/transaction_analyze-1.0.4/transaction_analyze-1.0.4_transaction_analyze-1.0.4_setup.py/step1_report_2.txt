  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for packaging the 'transaction_analyze' Python module.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, such as name, version, description, packages, author, license, install_requires, and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flow is straightforward: it assigns static metadata to the setup() function without external data input or processing.",
  "anomalies": "The license is set to 'Python Script', which is unconventional and may be a placeholder; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code are present. The code does not execute external code or perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and optional requirements. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, secret leaks, or network activity. The license name is unusual but not malicious. The code is minimal and structured correctly for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
