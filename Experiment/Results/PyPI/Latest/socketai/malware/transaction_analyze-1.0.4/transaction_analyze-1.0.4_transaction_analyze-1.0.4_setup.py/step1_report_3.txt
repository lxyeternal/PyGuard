{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'transaction_analyze', specifying its metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package name, version, description, author, license, install_requires, and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or insecure code execution points.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is declarative configuration, not flow-based or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual license value 'Python Script', which is non-standard; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script utilizes setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. It specifies a dependency 'blessings' with a compatible version, includes development dependencies, and sets author and license info. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The license field's value is unconventional but not malicious. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The license field's unusual value does not impact security but is worth noting for correctness.",
