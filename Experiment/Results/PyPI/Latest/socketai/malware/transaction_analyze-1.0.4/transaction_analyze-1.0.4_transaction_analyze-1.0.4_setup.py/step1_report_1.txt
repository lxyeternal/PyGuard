  "purpose": "This code is used to configure and distribute a Python package named 'transaction_analyze' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or untrusted data inputs are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present; the code only specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks exists; the code solely defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code. The license string 'Python Script' is unconventional but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls the setup() function with package metadata including name, version, description, author, license, dependencies, and extra requirements. All elements are typical for Python package setup scripts. No user input or untrusted data is involved. The dependencies and metadata are standard and do not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The package appears safe based on the provided code.",
