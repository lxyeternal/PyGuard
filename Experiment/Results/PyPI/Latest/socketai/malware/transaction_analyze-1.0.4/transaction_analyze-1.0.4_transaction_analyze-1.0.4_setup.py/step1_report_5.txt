{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'transaction_analyze'.",
  "sources": "The source code reads static metadata such as package name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only declares package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves assigning static values to setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; all code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, user inputs, or environment-dependent code. The dependencies listed ('blessings ~= 1.7') are standard and benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The license is labeled as 'Python Script', which is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code performs typical package setup tasks without any signs of sabotage, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply specifies package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
