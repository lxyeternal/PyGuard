  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided evaluations.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and optional dev dependencies.\n- The license field is set to \"Python Script,\" which is unconventional but not inherently malicious.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports find evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **License field:** Unusual value (\"Python Script\") noted, but not suspicious.\n- **Dependencies:** The dependency \"blessings ~= 1.7\" is benign.\n- **Security risks:** None of the reports find actual security issues; some assign a very low risk score (~0.1), which seems appropriate given the lack of actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- **Risk scores:** Assigning a security risk of 0.1 across multiple reports might be overly cautious, but given the unconventional license string, it’s a minor concern rather than a serious risk.\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0, as the code is straightforward.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **risk scores** of 0.1 are acceptable but could be lowered to 0, as there's no real security concern.\n- The **malware scores** are accurate at 0.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are correct at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity or code obfuscation is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the unconventional license string, a minor risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, but since there's no actual vulnerability, it could be adjusted to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nBased on the code and reports:\n- The code is benign, standard setup script.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The minor concern about the license string does not translate into a real security risk.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if we consider the license anomaly as a minor concern)\n\n**Final assessment:** The package appears safe and free of malicious or obfuscated code.",
