  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, ensuring the scores align with the analysis and evidence.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, function calls like eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, potential execution points like eval/exec.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like eval/exec, network connections, or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns, potential obfuscation signs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual function usage.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no explicit malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network behavior. Confidence levels are moderate to high (0.7-0.8). Malware scores are consistently 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious code. Security risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), aligning with cautious but justified assessments. The absence of code in some reports limits analysis but does not suggest malicious intent. The scores are appropriate given the evidence and reasoning provided.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and reasonable, with no detected malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and malware scores correctly reflect the absence of malicious code. Minor adjustments to risk scores could be considered, but current values are appropriate. Overall, the code appears safe based on the available information.",
