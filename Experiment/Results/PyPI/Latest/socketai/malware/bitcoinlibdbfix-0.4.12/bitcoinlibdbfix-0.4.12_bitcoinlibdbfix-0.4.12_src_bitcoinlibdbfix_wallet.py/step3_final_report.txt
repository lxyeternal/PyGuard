{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Bitcoin wallet management system, including wallet creation, listing, key generation, transaction import, and sending.",
  "sources": "Reads user arguments for wallet parameters, passphrases, filenames for transaction import, and outputs for transactions.",
  "sinks": "Print statements revealing passphrases, private keys, transaction hashes, and status messages; file reading for transaction data.",
  "flows": "User input (args, filenames) → processing functions → sensitive data printed or transaction processed.",
  "anomalies": "Sensitive data such as passphrases, WIFs, and private keys are printed directly to console, which is insecure. Some functions are incomplete ('pass'), indicating partial implementation. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code relies on bitcoinlib for wallet operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. Printing sensitive data is a security concern but not malicious. The incomplete functions do not impact security assessment. No external network activity or obfuscation is present. The code structure is straightforward and uses standard libraries. The main risk stems from insecure handling of secrets, which could lead to leaks if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate Bitcoin wallet management script with no malicious intent or malware. The primary security issue is the insecure printing of sensitive information, which should be addressed. No evidence of sabotage or supply chain compromise. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.4 due to insecure data handling.",
