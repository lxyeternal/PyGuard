{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package by importing key components and attempting to run pre-install checks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.cli, .version, .installer); run_pre_install function call if available.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; mainly module imports and a conditional function call.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> if run_pre_install exists, execute it during import -> no other data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install during import could potentially perform setup actions. However, it is a common pattern in package initialization. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for CLI and version info, exposes them, and attempts to run a pre-install hook if available. The try-except block suppresses ImportError, which is typical for optional dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior detected. The presence of run_pre_install suggests setup procedures, but nothing malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package initialization logic with optional pre-install checks. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. It functions as expected for a typical Python package setup.",
