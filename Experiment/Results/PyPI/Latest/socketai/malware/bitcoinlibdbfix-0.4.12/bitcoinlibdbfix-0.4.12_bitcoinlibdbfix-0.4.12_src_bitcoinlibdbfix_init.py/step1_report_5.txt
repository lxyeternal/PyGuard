  "purpose": "Module initialization and setup, including importing main functions, version info, and running pre-install checks if available.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.cli, .version, .installer). The run_pre_install function is called if present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points; only function calls and imports.",
  "flows": "Import statements flow into potential execution of run_pre_install, which runs during module import if available.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install during import, but this is typical for setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports essential components and attempts to run a pre-install routine if available, wrapped in a try-except block to avoid errors if the installer module isn't present. The pattern is common for setup or package initialization scripts. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The only dynamic behavior is optional execution of run_pre_install, which is a standard practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code performs standard package initialization tasks safely.",
