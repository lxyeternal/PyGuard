  "purpose": "This code sets up module exports, runs a pre-install check if possible, and handles import errors gracefully.",
  "sources": "Import statements for cli, version, and installer modules; execution of run_pre_install() during import.",
  "sinks": "run_pre_install() may perform actions based on the module's environment, but no direct data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Import of run_pre_install from installer -> execution of run_pre_install during import process.",
  "anomalies": "The call to run_pre_install() during import could execute arbitrary code; no apparent validation or sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines module exports and attempts to run a pre-install routine if available. The run_pre_install function is imported dynamically and invoked immediately upon import, which is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. This could execute code with the permissions of the importing context, but without further information about run_pre_install(), the risk is uncertain. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are observed. The exception handling ensures that import failure does not crash the process. Overall, the behavior is consistent with setup routines rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup module that performs a pre-install check if available. There are no evident malicious behaviors or security risks in this snippet. The immediate execution of run_pre_install() could be a concern if the function contains malicious code, but based on this snippet alone, it is typical setup behavior.",
