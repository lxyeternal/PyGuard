  "anomalies": "Calling 'run_pre_install()' during import without validation; no evidence of malicious code in the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script with imports and a conditional pre-install hook. The invocation of 'run_pre_install()' during import could pose a risk if the function contains malicious code, but without its implementation, no malicious activity can be confirmed. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code. The risk score is conservatively set around 0.2, acknowledging the potential danger of executing untrusted code during import. The overall confidence is high that the code itself is benign, but execution during import warrants cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with a conditional pre-install hook. No evidence of malicious behavior is present, but executing 'run_pre_install()' during import could be risky if the function is malicious. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, with a low security risk assigned due to the potential for executing untrusted code. No changes are necessary given the current evidence.",
