  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, data processing functions, network interactions, dynamic execution points, import statements, environment variable usage.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network connections, dynamic code execution, system modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network calls or system modifications, possibly via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation indicators, dynamic execution features, unusual import patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network domains.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no concrete malicious activity. Scores for malware are consistently low (0 or 0.1), obfuscation scores are minimal, and security risks are low (0.2-0.3). Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting cautious but justified assessments. Slightly increasing malware scores in reports mentioning dynamic features could better reflect potential concerns, but current scores are appropriate given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and justified in their assessments, indicating a low likelihood of malicious activity. Minor suspicion regarding dynamic features warrants marginally higher malware scores if desired, but overall, the code appears safe with minimal security risks.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.1,
