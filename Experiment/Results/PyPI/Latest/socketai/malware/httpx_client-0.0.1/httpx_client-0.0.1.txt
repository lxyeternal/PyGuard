      "conclusion": "The code is incomplete and does not perform any malicious activity in its current form. The pattern of fetching and executing remote code is inherently dangerous if invoked, but as-is, it is safe. The scores should reflect the current inactive state, with malware and security risk scores near zero, acknowledging potential if the function is invoked."

      "conclusion": "The code pattern is highly suspicious and potentially malicious due to remote code execution without validation. It aligns with common malicious supply chain attack vectors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; they could be slightly increased to reflect the severity. Overall, this code should be considered dangerous and potentially malicious."
