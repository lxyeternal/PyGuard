{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function intended to fetch and execute code from GitHub but does not invoke it, thus not executing any remote code.",
  "sources": "The imported function 'execute_code_from_github' (not invoked), and the 'requests' library (unused).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are triggered as the function is not called; no data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "No active data flow occurs since 'execute_code_from_github' is referenced but not executed.",
  "anomalies": "The function is imported but not invoked (missing parentheses), and 'requests' is imported but unused; code appears incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'execute_code_from_github' and 'requests', but the function is not called, so no external code is fetched or executed. The pattern suggests potential for remote code execution if invoked, but in its current state, it does nothing. The missing parentheses indicate an incomplete or placeholder script. No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code is present. The code's current behavior is safe, but the pattern is risky if used improperly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is incomplete and does not perform any malicious activity in its current form. The pattern of fetching and executing remote code is inherently dangerous if invoked, but as-is, it is safe. The scores should reflect the current inactive state, with malware and security risk scores near zero, acknowledging potential if the function is invoked.",
