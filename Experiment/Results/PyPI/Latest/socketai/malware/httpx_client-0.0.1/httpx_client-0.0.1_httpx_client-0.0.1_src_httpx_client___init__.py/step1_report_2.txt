  "purpose": "Dynamically fetches and executes code from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrunknown12321/1234/refs/heads/main/1234' via requests.get()",
  "sinks": "exec(code) which executes fetched code without validation",
  "flows": "requests.get() retrieves remote code, which is then directly executed with exec()",
  "anomalies": "Code installs the 'requests' module if missing, then fetches and executes remote code without validation or sanitization. The URL appears suspicious, potentially hosting malicious code. The use of exec() on remote content is highly risky.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by ensuring the 'requests' library is installed, then proceeds to fetch code from a suspicious URL. If the HTTP response is successful, it executes the code directly via exec(), which is a significant security risk. There are no safeguards such as code validation, sandboxing, or verification mechanisms. The overall behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary remote code, which could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically downloads and executes remote code without validation, posing a high security risk. This pattern is characteristic of malicious or backdoor behavior, enabling remote command execution or malware deployment.",
