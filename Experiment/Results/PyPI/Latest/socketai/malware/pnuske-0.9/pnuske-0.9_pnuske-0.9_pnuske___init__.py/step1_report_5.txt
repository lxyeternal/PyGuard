  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely to execute or initialize some process.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a local module; no input data is read directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are apparent in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible; code simply imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, only a single import statement with relative import syntax; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a function named 'run' from a module named 'main' located in the same package. It is a standard import statement with no suspicious or malicious behavior. Due to its simplicity, no data processing, external network communication, or security-sensitive operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an import statement to include functionality from a local module. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this line.",
