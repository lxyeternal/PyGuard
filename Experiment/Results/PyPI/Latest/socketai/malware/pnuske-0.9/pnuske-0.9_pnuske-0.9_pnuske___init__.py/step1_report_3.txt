{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'run' from '.main'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the invocation of 'run' if called later, but not shown in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown; if 'run' is called elsewhere, data may flow from external sources into 'run'.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a simple import statement with no visible suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a single import statement, which is standard in Python modules. There are no inputs, outputs, or execution flows shown that could indicate malicious activity. Without additional context or code that invokes 'run', no malicious behavior or security issues can be inferred from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is benign, representing a typical import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
