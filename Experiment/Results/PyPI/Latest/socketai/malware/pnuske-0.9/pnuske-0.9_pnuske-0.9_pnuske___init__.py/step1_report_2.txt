  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow since only an import statement exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not perform any actions; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'run' from a relative module 'main'. There are no data inputs, no external connections, and no executable logic that could pose security risks. The code appears to be part of a larger project, relying on external code to execute functions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase.",
