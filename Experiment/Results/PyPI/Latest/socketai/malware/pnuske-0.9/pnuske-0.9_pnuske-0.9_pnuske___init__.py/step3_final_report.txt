{
  "purpose": "Import a module named 'run' from the current package, likely to invoke or utilize its functionality elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import simply makes a module available for use, with no data transfer or execution flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python import statement: 'from .main import run'. It does not execute any code, read data, or perform network operations. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score, while slightly above zero in some reports, can be confidently lowered to 0 given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation. The overall assessment confirms that this code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing scores are appropriate; however, the security risk score can be refined to 0 for maximum accuracy. No changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
