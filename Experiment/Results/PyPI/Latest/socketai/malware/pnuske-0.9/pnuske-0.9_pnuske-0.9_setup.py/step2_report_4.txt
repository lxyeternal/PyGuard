  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- The analysis is accurate; the code is typical for Python packaging.\n- Malware score: 0, which is appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0.1 seems reasonable given the setup script's nature, but since there's no malicious activity, it could be lowered to 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms no suspicious behavior.\n- The analysis is consistent.\n- Malware score: 0, appropriate.\n- Security risk: 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, a straightforward setup script.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusion: standard setup, no malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above; standard setup script.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script for packaging.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The only potential concern could be the execution of the `pnuske:run` function, but since its implementation is outside this script, there's no evidence here to suggest malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the clear code.\n- The security risk scores are minimal (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the context.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (since it's a standard setup script with no suspicious activity)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this setup script. No malicious or obfuscated code is present, and the risk scores are appropriately low.",
