  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and entry point.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, package name/version, find_packages(), entry_points for console_scripts.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'pnuske:run' when the command line script is invoked; external module code outside this script.",
  "flows": "Setup script initializes package; actual behavior depends on 'pnuske:run' implementation, which is outside this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected within this setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py for packaging a Python project. It imports standard functions, specifies package info, and defines a console script entry point. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The 'pnuske:run' function's implementation is outside this script, so its safety cannot be assessed here, but the setup code itself is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of this code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues within this setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a standard, safe packaging script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk and malware scores are correctly assigned as zero, and the overall security posture is benign.",
