  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pnuske' Python package.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or external data; standard setup script.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'pnuske:run' via command line, which depends on the implementation of 'run' in 'pnuske' module.",
  "flows": "The setup defines a console script entry point that calls 'pnuske:run' when executed from command line.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The script is a typical setup.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions for package setup, specifies package metadata, and defines a console script entry point. No malicious code or suspicious activity is present. The only dynamic element is the entry point, which relies on the implementation of 'run' in the 'pnuske' module. Without inspecting 'pnuske', there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The script is straightforward and standard for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a benign configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on the provided code.",
