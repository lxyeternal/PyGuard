  "purpose": "Configure and prepare the Python package 'pnuske' for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it defines package metadata and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools to facilitate package setup. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, and packages found automatically. It also sets up a console script entry point, which links the command 'pnuske' to the 'run' function within the 'pnuske' module. There are no dynamic code executions, external data inputs, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly uses setuptools to configure packaging and entry points. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present.",
