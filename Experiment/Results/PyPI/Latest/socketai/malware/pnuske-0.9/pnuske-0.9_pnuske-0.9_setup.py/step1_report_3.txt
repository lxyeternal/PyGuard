  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Importing from setuptools, calling setup() with package metadata and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply invokes setup with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, specifying package info and a console script entry point. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated/malicious logic. The entry point indicates that the package will create a command-line executable called 'pnuske' that runs the 'run' function in the 'pnuske' module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward and benign package setup script with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
