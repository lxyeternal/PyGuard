  "conclusion": "The script is primarily a privacy-invasive data collection tool with high potential for misuse due to embedded credentials and silent operation. It does not contain malware in the traditional sense but poses significant privacy risks. The high malware and risk scores are justified given its capabilities, but it should be flagged for privacy violations rather than outright malware. Adjusting the malware score to around 0.65-0.7 and risk to approximately 0.8 would more accurately reflect its behavior."
