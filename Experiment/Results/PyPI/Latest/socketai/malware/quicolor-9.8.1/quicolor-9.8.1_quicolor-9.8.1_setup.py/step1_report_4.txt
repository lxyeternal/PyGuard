  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'quicolor'.",
  "sources": "N/A (configuration code does not read external data at runtime).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data is processed or written).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from source to sink; it's static configuration).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup configuration with no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup. It specifies package details, dependencies, author info, description, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or unsafe operations, no code injection, or malicious constructs. The only external dependency listed is 'requests', which is a common library and not inherently malicious. The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging and does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
