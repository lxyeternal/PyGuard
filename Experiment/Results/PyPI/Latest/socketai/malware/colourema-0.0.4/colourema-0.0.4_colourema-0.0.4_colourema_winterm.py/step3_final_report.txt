  "purpose": "A Windows-specific console manipulation library that manages console colors, styles, cursor positioning, screen clearing, and title setting through win32 API calls.",
  "sources": "Reads console handle information, system attributes, and cursor positions via win32 API functions; environment validation checks for win32.windll and winapi_test.",
  "sinks": "Modifies console display attributes, cursor position, and screen content via win32 API calls; no external data processing or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "System info is retrieved and stored; console attributes are set and reset; cursor and screen are manipulated through API calls; title is set via API.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard try-except handling around get_osfhandle; environment checks are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Windows console API functions for styling, cursor, and screen management. It performs legitimate system calls without processing untrusted data or performing network operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The environment validation is standard for Windows-specific code. The functions for enabling VT processing and manipulating console state are typical and do not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console utility library with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent and justified given its functionality.",
