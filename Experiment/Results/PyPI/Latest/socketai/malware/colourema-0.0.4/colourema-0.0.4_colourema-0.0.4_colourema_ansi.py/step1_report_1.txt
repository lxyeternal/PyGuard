{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text coloring, styling, and cursor movement, intended for terminal output formatting.",
  "sources": "The code defines static constants and methods that generate ANSI escape sequences based on predefined numeric codes.",
  "sinks": "The functions return ANSI escape sequences as strings; these are intended for terminal output and do not directly handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The static numeric codes are converted into escape sequences; no data flows from external sources into these functions at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal coloring and cursor control using predefined constants. The class initializations dynamically wrap static codes with escape sequences during object creation, which is a standard pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses only standard ANSI control sequences. No external input handling or unsafe operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal output styling. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe for use as a dependency in larger projects.",
