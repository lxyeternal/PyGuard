{
  "purpose": "The code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, cursor movements, and screen manipulations.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only defines constants, functions, and classes for generating ANSI codes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform data leaks, system modifications, or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the functions simply return static or parameterized ANSI escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated segments. It is straightforward terminal formatting utility code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text and cursor control. It initializes class attributes with escape sequences upon instantiation, which is standard behavior for such utilities. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network or file operations, and no data handling that could lead to security risks. The code appears to be a benign library intended for terminal UI styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ANSI terminal formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any actions that could harm the system or leak data. The code is well-structured and free from anomalies or obfuscation.",
