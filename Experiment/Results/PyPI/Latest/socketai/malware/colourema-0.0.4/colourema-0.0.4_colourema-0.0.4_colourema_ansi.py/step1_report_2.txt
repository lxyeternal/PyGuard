{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, such as setting colors, styles, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Constants defining escape codes, class attributes defining color and style codes, functions generating escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating ANSI escape sequences based on input parameters, which are used to format terminal output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, cursor positions) flow into functions that produce corresponding escape sequences, used for terminal display control.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. The code simply defines escape sequences and utility functions for terminal control.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of ANSI escape sequence generators, including classes for foreground and background colors, styles, and cursor control. It uses standard Python practices with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library for terminal text formatting with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and solely intended for aesthetic terminal output formatting.",
