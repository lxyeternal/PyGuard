{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling, cursor movement, and screen clearing, serving as a utility for terminal formatting.",
  "sources": "Defined constants and functions that return escape sequences; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The functions return escape sequences that can be printed to the terminal; no untrusted data flows into or out of the code.",
  "flows": "Static code defines escape sequences; functions generate sequences based on parameters; no dynamic or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It defines constants, functions, and classes that produce escape sequences based on predefined codes. There is no external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is clear, well-documented, and free of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The minimal security risk score assigned in one report (0.1) is unjustified given the lack of any risky operations; it should be adjusted to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly 0. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code is safe for supply chain use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard ANSI escape sequence generator with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. All reports' assessments are accurate; only the minor security risk score should be corrected to zero to reflect the benign nature of the code.",
