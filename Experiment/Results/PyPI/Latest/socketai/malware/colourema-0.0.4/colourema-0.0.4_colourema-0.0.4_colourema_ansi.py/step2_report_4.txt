  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: Confirms the code is a benign ANSI escape sequence generator with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Confidence**: 1\n\n**Assessment**: The report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The malware and security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the code is a standard terminal formatting utility, with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Confidence**: 1.0\n\n**Assessment**: Consistent with the previous, no issues detected. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, confirms benign nature, standard utility functions, no external data handling or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Confidence**: 1\n\n**Assessment**: No concerns here; the evaluation aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to others, straightforward utility with no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0.1\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Confidence**: 1\n\n**Observation**: The security risk score is slightly above zero, at 0.1. Given the code's nature, this is likely an overestimation. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks—no network, no file access, no untrusted input handling.\n\n**Recommendation**: The security risk score should be adjusted to 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as others—benign, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Confidence**: 1\n\n**Assessment**: Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only inconsistency is in Report 4, where the security risk score is 0.1 despite no evidence of risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk**: Should be 0 for all reports, including Report 4, since the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a standard, safe utility for generating ANSI escape sequences. No security risks or malware concerns are present. The scores should reflect this, with a risk score of 0 across all reports.",
