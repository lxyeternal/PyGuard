  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a benign utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward and safe. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a standard terminal formatting library with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—benign ANSI formatting utility, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is a straightforward ANSI escape sequence generator. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) is noted, but no evidence of actual malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** The minor securityRisk score appears to be a conservative default or a placeholder, but given the lack of any suspicious activity, it should be lowered to 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others—benign, utility code with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification and Final Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is accurate. No malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, and the code is clear and well-structured. No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, except Report 4 which assigns 0.1. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the risk score should be **0** across all reports for consistency and accuracy.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Adjust the securityRisk score in Report 4 from 0.1 to 0.**  \n- **Maintain malware=0 and obfuscated=0 across all reports.**  \n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be:**\n\n| malware | obfuscated | securityRisk |\n|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, well-documented utility for generating ANSI escape sequences. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks exists. The minor securityRisk score in one report should be corrected to align with the others, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** This code is safe for inclusion in supply chain contexts, provided it remains unmodified and used as intended.",
