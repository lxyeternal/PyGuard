{
  "purpose": "The code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor positioning.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions for color and style codes, function parameters for terminal control commands.",
  "sinks": "Functions returning formatted escape sequences, potentially sent to a terminal or other output device.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., color codes, cursor positions) flow into string concatenations generating escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No use of untrusted input, external network communication, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script defines constants, utility functions, and classes for ANSI terminal control sequences. It wraps standard ANSI codes into functions and classes for easy use. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious command execution, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be purely for terminal formatting purposes. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The structure is straightforward, with no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ANSI escape sequence generator for terminal styling and cursor movement, with no malicious or security-sensitive behavior observed. It functions as a utility module for terminal output formatting.",
