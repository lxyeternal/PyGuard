{
  "purpose": "The code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, cursor positioning, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions and function parameters for code_to_chars, set_title, clear_screen, clear_line, and AnsiCursor methods.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that generate escape sequences, which are outputted to the terminal for formatting purposes.",
  "flows": "Inputs such as color codes, cursor positions, and terminal commands flow directly into return statements generating escape sequences, which are then used for terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present. All functions serve standard terminal formatting purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling and cursor movement. The classes organize foreground colors, background colors, styles, and cursor movements. The functions and class methods simply produce escape sequences based on input parameters. There are no external data reads, no untrusted data handling, and no network activity. The code appears to be straightforward terminal formatting utility code, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard ANSI terminal formatting utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It solely generates escape sequences for visual terminal effects and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
