  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. All reports identify that the code is purely a comment with licensing information, containing no executable code, data input/output, or data flows. They consistently conclude that there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present.\n\n2. The code snippet provided is only a comment block with copyright and license information, with no actual code, data processing, or potential for malicious activity.\n\n3. The scores assigned across all reports are:\n   - malware: 0\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate given the content. Since there is no executable code, data flow, or suspicious behavior, these scores are justified.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify the absence of executable code and malicious intent.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or reasoning.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, containing only licensing comments.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero.\n- The confidence is high (1.0), as the analysis is straightforward.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- I agree with the provided scores.\n- No further action or adjustment is needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- malware score: 0\n- obfuscated score: 0\n- security risk score: 0\n\nThis is a safe, standard licensing comment with no security concerns.",
