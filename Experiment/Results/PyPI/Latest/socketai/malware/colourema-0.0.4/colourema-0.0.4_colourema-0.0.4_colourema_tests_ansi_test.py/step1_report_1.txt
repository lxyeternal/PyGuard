  "purpose": "Unit tests for ANSI escape code definitions and their attributes in a color formatting library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, standard library modules, and class/method definitions that do not process untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that compare constant string values; no sinks for untrusted data execution or data leakage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines and tests constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code consists of standard test cases.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a test class for verifying ANSI color code constants. It performs standard setup and teardown procedures, and asserts that color constants match expected ANSI escape sequences. No dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity occurs. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely for unit testing and validation of constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for ANSI escape code constants with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected.",
