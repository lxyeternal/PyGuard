  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying ANSI escape code constants for foreground, background, and style attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statements, static constant definitions, no untrusted input or external data.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on predefined constants, no data leaks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static comparisons only.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests that verify the correctness of ANSI escape sequence constants. It imports standard modules and local modules, performs assertions on static string constants, and manipulates stdout/stderr for test isolation. There is no dynamic input, external data, network activity, or execution of untrusted code. The code's purpose is purely to validate predefined constants, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. It only verifies constant values and does not process untrusted data or perform any external operations. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all zero, consistent with the analysis.",
