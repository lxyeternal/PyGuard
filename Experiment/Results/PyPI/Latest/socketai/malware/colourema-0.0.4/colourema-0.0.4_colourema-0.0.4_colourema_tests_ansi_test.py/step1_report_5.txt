{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for verifying ANSI escape code constants in a color and style module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from standard input and output streams (sys.stdout, sys.stderr) during setup and test assertions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data or perform network operations; it only verifies predefined constants.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the tests compare constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and ANSI code constants, performs assertions on these constants, and manages stdout/stderr streams to ensure no interference. It only tests for equality of static ANSI escape code strings. No input/output manipulation or external system interactions are observed. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for ANSI escape code constants. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and poses no security risks. The code is safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
