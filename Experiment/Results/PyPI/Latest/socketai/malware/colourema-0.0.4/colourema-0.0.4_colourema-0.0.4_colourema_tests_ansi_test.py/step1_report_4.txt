  "purpose": "Unit tests for ANSI escape code constants in color formatting modules",
  "sources": "Imports modules sys, unittest, and local modules ansi and ansitowin32",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; test assertions compare predefined constants",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static constant checks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs static assertions on ANSI color and style constants. It imports standard modules and local modules, and tests that the ANSI codes match expected escape sequences. The use of unittest framework is standard for testing; no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution observed. No suspicious or malicious behaviors identified. The code appears to be purely for testing ANSI escape sequence constants with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of unit tests verifying ANSI escape code constants. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code is benign and purely for validation purposes.",
