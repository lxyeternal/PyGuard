{
  "purpose": "The code provides Windows-specific console manipulation functions, including retrieving and setting console buffer info, text attributes, cursor position, and console title, primarily for display control and formatting.",
  "sources": "System handles obtained via Windows API functions such as GetStdHandle, and functions that read or modify console state (e.g., GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode).",
  "sinks": "Functions that modify console appearance and behavior, such as changing text attributes, cursor position, console title, and console mode settings.",
  "flows": "Retrieval of console handles -> querying or modifying console buffer info or attributes -> applying changes to console state (e.g., cursor position, text attributes, title).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscation, no handling of untrusted input, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code interfaces with Windows API to manipulate console properties, performing standard system calls for console control. It includes error handling for Windows API failures but does not process external or untrusted data. The functions are straightforward wrappers around system calls, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code degrades gracefully on non-Windows systems by defining dummy functions. There are no backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors detected. The purpose appears to be purely for console display management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0 and very low security risk. The scores are consistent with the code's functionality and purpose.",
