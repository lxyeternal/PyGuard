{
  "purpose": "This code provides Windows console manipulation functions such as setting text attributes, cursor position, console title, and buffer info. It appears to facilitate enhanced console control and customization.",
  "sources": "The code reads system handles via _GetStdHandle, and console configuration via functions like _GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, _GetConsoleMode, and _SetConsoleTitleW. No external input sources or user data are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that modify console display attributes, cursor positions, and title, which could be exploited to manipulate the console appearance or behavior. No data exfiltration or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves console handles, then uses those handles to get buffer info, set text attributes, cursor positions, or console titles, with optional adjustments based on viewport. No flows involve untrusted data input leading to security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are evident. The code is focused on console manipulation, with no indications of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The structure is straightforward, with standard system API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for interacting with Windows console API, primarily for visual and positional adjustments. It conditionally imports Windows-specific modules and gracefully degrades if not on Windows. All functions operate on system handles and perform standard console operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is consistent with typical console utility functions, and there is no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate set of Windows console control functions with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed for console customization and does not handle or transmit untrusted input data. Its purpose is benign, and there are no indicators of malware or security threats.",
