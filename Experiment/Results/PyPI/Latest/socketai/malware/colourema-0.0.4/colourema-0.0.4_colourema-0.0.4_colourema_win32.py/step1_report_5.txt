{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for interacting with Windows console APIs, including functions to get and set console modes, titles, cursor positions, and buffer information.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'ctypes' and 'ctypes.wintypes', which are standard Python modules for calling Windows DLL functions.",
  "sinks": "Functions that modify console attributes, cursor positions, and titles, potentially affecting the console display but not data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves console handles, calls Windows API functions to manipulate console states, and optionally adjusts cursor positions or console attributes based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications. No obfuscated or unusual code structures. The functions appear to perform legitimate console management tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports and sets up Windows console API functions. It includes functions for reading console buffer info, setting text attributes, cursor positioning, filling output buffers, and changing the console window title. All operations interact solely with the local console environment. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious commands, or external network activity. The code adheres to standard Windows API usage patterns and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured Windows console utility module. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It is intended for managing console appearance and behavior within Windows environments. No security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
