  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization module for a terminal styling library, importing functions and classes related to ANSI escape sequences and console handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: initialise, ansi, ansitowin32",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import statements load internal modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports internal components and defines a version string. It contains no external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The absence of suspicious patterns or malicious code indicates a benign purpose. Scores assigned by previous reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization segment for a terminal styling library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
