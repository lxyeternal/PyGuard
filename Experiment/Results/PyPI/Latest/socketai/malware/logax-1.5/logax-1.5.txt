      "conclusion": "The code is benign, a typical setup script with no malicious or security issues. The minor metadata placeholders do not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with appropriate malware and obfuscation scores set to zero and a very low security risk score justified by incomplete metadata. Confidence in this assessment is high."

      "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not indicate malicious behavior, but the use of wildcard import warrants caution. The overall security risk is low but not negligible, pending inspection of the 'info' module. Malware and obfuscation are unlikely; the primary concern is namespace pollution and potential hidden malicious symbols if 'info' is compromised."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activity, including remote code download and execution, obfuscation, and error concealment. While no explicit malware payload is embedded, the pattern strongly suggests malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0.9, security risk to 0.9, and obfuscation to 0.9, reflecting high suspicion and danger."
