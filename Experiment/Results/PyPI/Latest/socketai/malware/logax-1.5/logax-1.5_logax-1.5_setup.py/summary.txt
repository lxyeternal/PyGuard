  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a typical setup script with no malicious or security issues. The minor metadata placeholders do not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with appropriate malware and obfuscation scores set to zero and a very low security risk score justified by incomplete metadata. Confidence in this assessment is high."
