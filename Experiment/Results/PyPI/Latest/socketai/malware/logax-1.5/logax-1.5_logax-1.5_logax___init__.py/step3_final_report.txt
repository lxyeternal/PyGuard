  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of the import statement 'from .info import *' in the context of supply chain security for an open source Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'info' via a wildcard import.",
  "sinks": "Potentially imported symbols could be used in the package, but no direct sink (e.g., network, file, or environment) is evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Symbols imported from 'info' could flow into the package's namespace, but without inspecting 'info', the actual flow of malicious data cannot be confirmed.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard import is unusual and risky, as it can hide malicious symbols or secrets if 'info' is compromised. No obfuscation or malicious code is directly present in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import with a wildcard, which is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential security risks. The 'info' module's contents are unknown, so the risk depends on its integrity. Malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious activity. The security risk score is modest (~0.2-0.3), considering the import pattern and the unknown 'info' content. Confidence in this assessment is moderate (~0.6), given the limited context. The main concern is the potential for malicious symbols within 'info' if it is compromised, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement alone does not indicate malicious behavior, but the use of wildcard import warrants caution. The overall security risk is low but not negligible, pending inspection of the 'info' module. Malware and obfuscation are unlikely; the primary concern is namespace pollution and potential hidden malicious symbols if 'info' is compromised.",
