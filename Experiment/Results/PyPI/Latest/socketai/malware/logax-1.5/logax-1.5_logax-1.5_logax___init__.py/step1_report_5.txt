{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads code or data from the 'info' module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident from the single import statement; it simply brings in external code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are visible in this single line. Lack of context about 'info' makes it impossible to assess further, but the import itself is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a wildcard import from a local module, which could potentially introduce namespace pollution or unforeseen behaviors depending on the contents of 'info'. However, as a standalone statement, it does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. Without additional context or code, no anomalies or malicious activity can be identified. Import statements are common and not inherently suspicious, but the security depends on the content of the imported module.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement that by itself does not pose security risks or malicious intent. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected in this minimal code snippet.",
