  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: `from .info import *`.\n- The core concern is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure what symbols are imported and potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised.\n- No actual malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration is indicated in the snippet.\n- The 'info' module's contents are unknown, which is a key factor in assessing risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code snippet is simply an import statement; no issues are directly present in the code itself.\n- The use of `*` import is generally discouraged because it can hide malicious code or secrets if the imported module is malicious or compromised.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports correctly identify the potential risks associated with wildcard imports but often conclude low risk because the snippet alone isn't malicious.\n- Some reports assign a malware score of 0, which is reasonable given the code snippet.\n- The confidence scores are mostly 0.6 to 0.7, which is acceptable considering the limited context.\n- The security risk scores are mostly low (0.1 to 0.3), which aligns with the fact that the code itself is benign but warrants caution.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** Since the code is just an import, and there's no evidence of malicious activity, a malware score of 0 seems appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation is present, so 0 is justified.\n- **Risk score:** Given the potential for malicious code within 'info', the risk score should reflect the uncertainty. The scores assigned (mostly 0.2-0.3) seem reasonable but could be slightly higher if we consider the risk of compromised modules.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- If the 'info' module is compromised or malicious, importing everything could introduce malicious symbols into the namespace.\n- The practice of using `*` import is risky in package management and security, especially if the source is untrusted.\n- Since the content of 'info' is unknown, a conservative approach would assign a risk score of around 0.4-0.5 to reflect this uncertainty.\n\n### Consistency with the reports:\n- The reports' assessments are consistent with the code snippet.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are mostly low, which is acceptable but could be slightly increased considering the potential for malicious 'info' content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity in the import statement itself.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 — due to the use of wildcard import and unknown content of 'info', there's a moderate risk if the module is malicious or compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate in their cautious approach. The code itself is benign but warrants further review of the 'info' module to ensure it isn't malicious. The scores should remain low but slightly higher than zero to reflect the potential risk inherent in importing all symbols from an untrusted module.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0, but increase the overall security risk score to around 0.4 to account for the potential threat posed by the 'info' module's unknown contents.",
