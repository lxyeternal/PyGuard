{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'info' in the same package, likely to use its functions or variables.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'info' module located in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are directly present in this line; potential sinks depend on usage elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible here; the import might load data or code for later use.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code, but in itself, it is a common pattern. No direct anomalies are visible in this statement alone.",
  "analysis": "This code imports all definitions from a relative module named 'info', which could be benign or malicious depending on its contents. The statement itself is syntactically correct and common in Python packages. Without inspecting 'info', no malicious behavior can be determined. The line does not execute code dynamically or handle untrusted input. No clear indicators of malicious activity or security risks are present in this single import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard import of all contents from a module within the same package. On its own, it does not indicate malicious behavior or security issues. Further inspection of the 'info' module is needed to determine any potential risks.",
