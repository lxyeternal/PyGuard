  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious code or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement with a wildcard from a local module. This pattern is common but can be problematic if the imported module contains malicious code or secret data. The import statement itself does not exhibit malicious behavior but raises concerns about obscured content. No other code or dynamic execution is present. Without examining the 'info' module, the overall security risk cannot be fully assessed; however, the import pattern itself is suspicious for obfuscation or hiding malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and appears benign but is suspicious due to the use of wildcard import, which can hide malicious code or secrets in the imported module. Without further context on the 'info' module, the risk cannot be definitively determined, but the pattern warrants caution.",
