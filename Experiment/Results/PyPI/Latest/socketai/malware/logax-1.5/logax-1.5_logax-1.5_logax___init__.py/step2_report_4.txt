  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .info import *`.\n- No code execution, dynamic code, network activity, or data exfiltration is observed.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised.\n- The 'info' module's contents are unknown; the risk assessment depends heavily on its integrity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious payloads are present in the snippet itself.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The use of `from .info import *` is generally discouraged because it pollutes the namespace and can hide malicious or unintended symbols.\n- Relying solely on the import statement without inspecting the 'info' module is risky if the module could be malicious or compromised.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code snippet alone. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3. These are reasonable considering the use of wildcard import can be risky if the module is malicious, but the code itself isn't malicious.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is just an import, the actual risk depends on the 'info' module. Without inspecting 'info', the risk is minimal but not zero.\n- The scores reflect this cautious stance: low but not zero, due to the potential for malicious content in the imported module.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious intent solely based on the import statement.\n- They note the risk associated with wildcard imports but do not overstate it.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no report assigns a high risk or malware score unjustifiably.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the information, **the code itself is benign** but **the use of wildcard import warrants caution**. The actual security risk hinges on the 'info' module's integrity, which is unknown.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to the wildcard import and unknown module content)\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is minimal and standard.\n- The main concern is the potential for malicious content in 'info', but there's no direct evidence.\n- The current scores are appropriate; I would keep them as-is, with perhaps a slight increase in security risk to 0.2 to reflect cautious awareness.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of the imported module to accurately assess security implications.",
