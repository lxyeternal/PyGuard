{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .info module, which reads data from the 'info' module file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is being written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'info' module to the current namespace via import, but no further data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no additional logic or obfuscation. Importing all symbols can be risky but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement from a local module, using a relative import syntax. There are no signs of malicious code, such as dynamic execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The minimal content provides no evidence of malicious intent. However, importing everything with '*' can potentially introduce unwanted symbols or malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised, but there is no direct indication of this in the snippet provided.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. It does not include complex logic or suspicious activities, but the practice of using '*' in imports can be considered risky if the imported module is malicious. Overall, the code appears benign based solely on this snippet.",
