  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports identify a single line of code: `from .info import *`.\n- They acknowledge that this is a wildcard import from a local module.\n- No direct malicious activity, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration is observed.\n- The main concern is the use of `*`, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code or secrets if the 'info' module is compromised.\n- Confidence levels are generally around 0.6 to 0.7, indicating moderate certainty.\n- Malware scores are all 0, suggesting no direct evidence of malicious code.\n- Security risk scores are low, with some reports suggesting a slight caution due to the import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The import statement itself is syntactically correct and benign in isolation.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or active data flows.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard import (`*`), which can be risky if the 'info' module is malicious or compromised.\n\n### Errors or Flaws in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and cautious, correctly noting that the import alone does not indicate malicious activity.\n- They could emphasize more strongly that without inspecting the 'info' module's contents, the risk cannot be fully assessed.\n- No significant logical flaws are evident; the reasoning aligns with standard security considerations for wildcard imports.\n\n### Score Recommendations:\n- All current malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the lack of evidence.\n- Security risk scores are mostly low (0.1 to 0.3), which is reasonable but could be slightly increased if the 'info' module's trustworthiness is uncertain.\n- The overall risk assessment should remain low unless additional context indicates malicious content within 'info'.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is only an import statement with no active malicious behavior, scores above 0.5 are unwarranted.\n- The main concern is the potential for malicious content in 'info', but without evidence, this remains speculative.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- Malware scores at 0 reflect no detected malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are cautious but not overly high, aligning with the minimal code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malware)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1 (low risk, primarily due to wildcard import practice, which can be risky if the module is malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is benign in isolation. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which warrants caution but does not constitute an immediate security threat. Further review of the 'info' module is recommended to confirm its safety.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No signs of malware or obfuscation based on the provided snippet.  \n- The risk is minimal but warrants caution due to import practices.  \n- Scores should remain low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score around 0.1 to 0.2.",
