{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'info' in the same package, likely for access to functions, classes, or variables defined there.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data or code definitions from the 'info' module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks are evident in this snippet; it only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths within this single line; it solely imports the module's contents.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure imported content and potentially hide malicious code if present in 'info'. No other anomalies are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement using a wildcard, which can be problematic for readability and maintenance, but by itself does not indicate malicious behavior. Since the imported module's contents are unknown, there's a risk if the 'info' module contains malicious code, but the import statement alone is not malicious. No other suspicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network access, or obfuscated code, is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs a standard import of all definitions from a local module. It does not inherently contain malicious behavior, but the use of wildcard import warrants caution as it can mask malicious code within 'info'. Overall, the snippet alone is low risk but warrants further review of the 'info' module.",
