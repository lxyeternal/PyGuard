  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools, defining package info and a CLI entry point. No dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The entry point references a function in an external module, which is typical for CLI tools, but without inspecting that module, no malicious activity can be confirmed. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (~0.1). The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices suggest it is safe and free from malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and free from malware or obfuscation. The minimal risk score reflects typical CLI package behavior. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe based on the provided information.",
