  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup poses a significant security threat, potentially allowing malicious code execution at install time. The risk is high, and unless 'main()' is verified as safe, this pattern should be considered malicious or sabotage. The overall malware score should be at least 0.8, and the security risk around 0.8, reflecting the high potential for abuse."
