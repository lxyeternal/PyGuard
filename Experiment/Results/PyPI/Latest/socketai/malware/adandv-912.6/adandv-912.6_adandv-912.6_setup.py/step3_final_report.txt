{
  "purpose": "The code executes the 'main()' function from the 'main' module during package installation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes or sabotage.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' and calling 'main()' after the standard install process.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which can run arbitrary or malicious code.",
  "flows": "Setup process → import 'main' → call 'main()' → execution of potentially untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external code ('main()') during package installation without validation or safeguards; class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern involves executing 'main()' during setup, which is an uncommon and risky practice. This behavior can be exploited to run malicious code or backdoors if 'main()' contains harmful instructions. The scores in the reports underestimate the risk; executing arbitrary code during installation is a well-known supply chain attack vector. The behavior warrants a high malware and security risk score, especially when the content of 'main.py' is untrusted or unknown.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup poses a significant security threat, potentially allowing malicious code execution at install time. The risk is high, and unless 'main()' is verified as safe, this pattern should be considered malicious or sabotage. The overall malware score should be at least 0.8, and the security risk around 0.8, reflecting the high potential for abuse.",
