      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup poses a significant security threat, potentially allowing malicious code execution at install time. The risk is high, and unless 'main()' is verified as safe, this pattern should be considered malicious or sabotage. The overall malware score should be at least 0.8, and the security risk around 0.8, reflecting the high potential for abuse."

      "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains. While it does not contain active malware payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is indicative of malicious intent, warranting high security concern. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly adjusted to reflect the absence of payloads and the primary exfiltration activity."
