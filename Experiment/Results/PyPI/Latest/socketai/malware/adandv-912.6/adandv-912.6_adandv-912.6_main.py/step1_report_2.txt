  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data to specific external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading system network interfaces), random.randint() for generating rd_num.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with encoded parameters including system info and base64-encoded MAC addresses.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, MAC addresses, random number) are encoded and sent as URL parameters through the URL requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs for data exfiltration, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and the obfuscated domain names suggest possible malicious intent. The URLs appear suspicious and designed for covert data transmission. No user input validation or security controls are present.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers detailed system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 for transmission. It then constructs URLs targeting suspicious domains, appending system data and a random number as URL parameters, and performs GET requests to these URLs. The data exfiltration pattern combined with obfuscated and suspicious domains strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at covertly collecting and transmitting system data without user consent. The code does not perform any validation or sanitization, and the URLs are suspicious, suggesting potential malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect and exfiltrate system information to external, suspicious domains without user consent, indicating malicious behavior with data theft intent. It leverages obfuscated data encoding and external communication to covertly transmit sensitive information.",
