  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Platform module (platform.node()), getpass (getpass.getuser()), os (os.getcwd()), random (random.randint), subprocess (system commands), base64 (encoding MAC addresses).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources, encoded (MAC addresses), then included as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests to the listed URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded external URLs with suspicious domain names; encodes MAC addresses in base64, which may be used for fingerprinting. No user input is directly used, but the URL requests are made to untrusted domains. No obvious malicious payloads or backdoors, but the external communication indicates possible data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are fetched via system commands depending on OS. The collected MAC addresses are encoded in base64. The script then constructs URLs with this information as query parameters and sends GET requests to three suspicious domains. No data is processed or stored locally besides encoding, and there are no immediate signs of malware like reverse shells or damaging actions. The external URLs look suspicious and may be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads, but the external communication to unknown domains is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to gather and transmit system information to external servers, which could be used for tracking or malicious data collection. There is no direct evidence of harmful actions like malware or sabotage, but the external data exfiltration behavior raises security concerns. It should be treated as potentially malicious due to its suspicious external communication and data collection practices.",
