  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interface data, base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs, potentially exfiltrating system information.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) are gathered and encoded, then appended as URL parameters to external URLs, which are accessed via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple system commands ('getmac', 'ifconfig') without validation, base64 encoding MAC addresses, and sending data to suspicious domains. The URLs appear malicious or suspicious, possibly for data exfiltration. The code does not handle response data or validate responses.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes MAC addresses in base64. It constructs three URLs with these parameters and performs HTTP GET requests to these URLs. The URLs are on suspicious domains likely used for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not process responses, and the URL domains are potentially malicious. The use of subprocess calls for system info gathering and network requests without validation or encryption presents privacy and security concerns. There are no hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors, but the data exfiltration activity is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for system reconnaissance and exfiltration of system identifiers to external servers. The suspicious URLs and data collection behavior suggest malicious intent, likely for tracking or malicious data theft. Overall, it has a high likelihood of malicious behavior based on the external communication to suspicious domains.",
