  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains. While it does not contain active malware payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is indicative of malicious intent, warranting high security concern. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly adjusted to reflect the absence of payloads and the primary exfiltration activity."
