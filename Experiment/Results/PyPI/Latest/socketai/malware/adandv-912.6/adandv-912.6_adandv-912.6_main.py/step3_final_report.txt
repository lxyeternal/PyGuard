  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to suspicious external URLs, likely for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "sources": [
    "platform.node() for hostname",
    "getpass.getuser() for username",

  "flows": [
    "Source: system info and MAC addresses → Encoded in base64 → URL parameters → HTTP GET request to external URLs"

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of subprocess to gather MAC addresses without validation",
    "Suspicious external URLs likely used for data exfiltration",
    "Silent exception handling with no logging or validation",
    "No obfuscation in code but suspicious domains"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward collection of system info and MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via HTTP GET requests to three suspicious domains. The external URLs are likely malicious or used for tracking/data exfiltration. The code lacks validation, encryption beyond base64, or response handling, indicating covert data collection. The behavior aligns with reconnaissance or privacy violation activities. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, but the external communication to suspicious domains is concerning. The malware and risk scores should reflect malicious intent due to exfiltration behavior, despite the absence of active payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains. While it does not contain active malware payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is indicative of malicious intent, warranting high security concern. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly adjusted to reflect the absence of payloads and the primary exfiltration activity.",
