  "conclusion": "The supply chain security assessment indicates that most code is benign, with a notable exception in Report 4, which shows signs of malicious patterns and obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall risk is moderate to high only in the suspicious case. No adjustments are necessary; vigilance is advised for code containing eval()/exec() or obfuscation."
