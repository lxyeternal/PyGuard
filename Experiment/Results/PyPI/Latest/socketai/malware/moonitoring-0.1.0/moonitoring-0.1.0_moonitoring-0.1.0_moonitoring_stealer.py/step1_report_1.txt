  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring including keylogger and stealer modules.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection; instantiation of InputMonitor, MacStealer, WindowsStealer classes; threading.Thread for starting monitoring functions.",
  "sinks": "threading.Thread targets (start_monitoring, run) which execute monitoring functions, potentially capturing user input or system data.",
  "flows": "platform.system() → conditionals selecting OS-specific monitors → threading threads executing monitoring functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of monitoring modules (macOS stealer, keylogger) suggests potentially malicious surveillance activity. No credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No external network communication or data exfiltration shown in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code detects OS platform, then initiates keylogging and system data collection in separate threads. Modules named 'stealer' and 'keylogger' indicate monitoring behavior that could be malicious if used without user consent. No network activity or data exfiltration is explicitly shown here, but the imported modules' purposes are suspicious. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior. The presence of 'stealer' modules strongly suggests malicious intent if deployed maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code sets up platform-specific monitoring tools that could be used for malicious surveillance or data collection without user awareness. The use of modules named 'stealer' and 'keylogger' indicates potential malicious intent, depending on context. No explicit malicious activity is shown in this snippet, but the modules' purposes are suspicious.",
