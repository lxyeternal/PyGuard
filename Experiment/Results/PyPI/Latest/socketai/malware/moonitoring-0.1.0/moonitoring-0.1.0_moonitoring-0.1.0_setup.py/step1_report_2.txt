  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'moonitoring', intended for cross-platform system event monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description, defining package metadata, specifying dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no code executes untrusted data or commands.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> package setup configuration -> dependency installation directives.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard 'setuptools' for package setup. Reads a README file for description, defines package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. The dependencies are standard monitoring libraries and platform-specific packages. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code; all code follows typical setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
