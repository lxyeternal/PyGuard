{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and configure a Python package named 'moonitoring' for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; defines package metadata and dependencies within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or handling; no sinks that process user input or untrusted data",
  "flows": "Reads long description from file → passes metadata and dependencies to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code appears to be a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, classifiers, required Python version, and dependencies. It defines platform-specific extras. The code structure is typical for a Python package setup, with no suspicious or malicious code present. There are no sources or sinks for untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, obfuscated sections, or potential backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only performs package configuration and dependency declaration.",
