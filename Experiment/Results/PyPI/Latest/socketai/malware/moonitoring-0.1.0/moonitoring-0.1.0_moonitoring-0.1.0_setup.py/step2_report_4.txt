  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Python setup script, with no suspicious or malicious code, no untrusted data handling, and no anomalies.\n- The code reads a README.md file for the long description and specifies dependencies and optional platform-specific extras.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The dependencies are typical for a system monitoring library, and the setup process is straightforward.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code matches the original provided code and performs typical setup tasks.\n   - No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n   - No indication of code that could be malicious or insecure.\n\n2. **Scores and reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Risk scores:**\n   - Since no malicious or suspicious activity is detected, the overall risk should remain very low.\n   - The reports' confidence scores are 1, which seems justified based on the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about hidden behaviors; they rely on the code's straightforward nature.\n   - No need to increase malware or risk scores.\n\n5. **Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The detailed reasoning supports maintaining the current scores.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious code or behavior present                       |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Clear, straightforward code, no obfuscation detected       |\n| Security Risk   | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified            |\n\n**Final note:** The setup script is typical and safe. No changes needed.",
