  "conclusion": "This code is a benign abstract class template with a known security risk if the SSL disabling method is invoked during runtime. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the potential misuse of '_create_unverified_https', which could compromise security if not handled carefully. The existing scores are appropriate; a slight increase in the risk score to around 0.3 is justified to reflect this potential security implication."
