{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect wallet data, package it, and exfiltrate it via Telegram, while disabling SSL verification and using hardcoded credentials, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Wallets module data collection, functions.run_process calls, and hardcoded Telegram token.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data through Telegram, potentially leaking sensitive information to an attacker-controlled channel.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from wallet modules, processed into zip and preview formats, then transmitted via Telegram senders.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification (`ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context`), hardcoded Telegram token, commented-out code suggesting additional data collection routines, absence of input validation or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive wallet data, bypasses SSL security checks, and exfiltrates data via a hardcoded Telegram bot token, all without user consent. The straightforward structure and lack of obfuscation do not diminish its malicious intent. The use of threading and multiprocessing facilitates covert data collection. The presence of commented-out code hints at potential for further malicious activities. The hardcoded credentials and SSL bypass are strong indicators of malicious behavior, aligning with typical info-stealer malware. The code's actions pose a high security risk, capable of silently stealing and transmitting sensitive user data.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior, including data theft and exfiltration, with indicators such as hardcoded credentials and SSL bypass. The high malware and security risk scores are justified. It should be treated as malicious, and appropriate security measures should be taken to block or analyze further.",
