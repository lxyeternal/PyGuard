  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code's behavior—collecting wallet data, disabling SSL verification, hardcoded Telegram token, and sending data via Telegram—strongly indicates malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation is evident in the code; the main concern is the functionality and embedded credentials.\n- The reports' conclusions about malicious activity are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The malware scores (0.75–0.9) seem appropriate given the evidence.\n- The security risk scores (0.75–0.85) also seem justified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of Issues in Code:**\n  - The code **does** disable SSL verification (`ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context`), which is suspicious.\n  - The Telegram token is hardcoded, which is a security concern.\n  - The code appears to collect wallet data and exfiltrate via Telegram, matching the reports' claims.\n  - No signs of obfuscation are present; the code is straightforward but malicious in intent.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws in the Report's Logic:**\n  - The reports do not mention that the code **does** perform data collection and exfiltration; they mostly infer malicious intent based on behavior.\n  - The reasoning about \"potential vulnerabilities\" based on assumptions is reasonable, as the code's behavior indicates malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**\n  - The malware scores (0.75–0.9) are appropriate, given the evidence.\n  - The security risk scores (0.75–0.85) are also justified.\n  - The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, which aligns with the code's clarity.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n  - The reports do not overstate; they correctly interpret the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for Scores > 0.5:\n\n- The high malware scores (0.75–0.9) are justified due to:\n  - Data collection of sensitive info (wallets).\n  - Hardcoded Telegram token.\n  - SSL verification disabled.\n  - Data exfiltration via Telegram.\n- The security risk scores are high for similar reasons.\n\n### Consistency and Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the reports are aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0.85**  \n- Slightly higher than the highest report (0.9), but considering the code's clear malicious functions, 0.85 is appropriate.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- No obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.85**  \n- Reflects the high potential for malicious activity and data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports correctly identify the malicious nature of the code. Their reasoning is sound, and their scores are justified. The main concern is the embedded Telegram token, data collection routines, and SSL bypass, all indicative of malware.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores should remain as-is or slightly adjusted to 0.85 for malware and risk, reflecting the high severity.\n- No obfuscation; the code is straightforward but malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The overall threat level is high, and the code should be flagged as malicious with a malware score around **0.85** and a security risk score around **0.85**.",
