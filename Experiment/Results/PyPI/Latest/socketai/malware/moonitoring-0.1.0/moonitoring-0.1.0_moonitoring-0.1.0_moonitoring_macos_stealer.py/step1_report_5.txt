{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect sensitive data such as wallet information, package it into a zip archive, generate a preview, and send it via Telegram.",
  "sources": "Input data is collected from the Wallets object, and possibly other methods that are commented out. Data sources include wallet files and fields obtained from external modules.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to Telegram via a hardcoded bot token. Data files and preview information are created and transmitted, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Sources (wallet data/files) are collected within run_process calls, results are aggregated into a zip file and a preview, then sent to Telegram. The flow involves collecting data, packaging, and transmitting without validation.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token embedded in code, lack of data validation, and commented-out code sections suggest incomplete or potentially malicious data collection features.",
  "analysis": "The code initiates a thread that, after a delay, disables SSL verification and runs data collection processes via multiprocessing Pool. It collects wallet data through external modules, packages data into zip files and previews, and sends this data to a Telegram bot using a hardcoded token. The presence of a hardcoded token, combined with data collection from wallets and transmission over a messaging platform, indicates malicious intent, especially if intended without user consent. No explicit obfuscation or malicious code injection detected, but the pattern of data exfiltration is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a data stealer designed to extract wallet information and send it covertly via Telegram. The use of hardcoded credentials and the focus on sensitive data collection raise significant security concerns, suggesting malicious intent.",
