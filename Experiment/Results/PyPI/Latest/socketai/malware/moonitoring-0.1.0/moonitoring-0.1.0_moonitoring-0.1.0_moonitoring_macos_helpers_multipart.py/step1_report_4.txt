{
  "purpose": "The code creates a multipart/form-data encoder for constructing HTTP request bodies with form fields and files.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'fields' (list of key-value pairs) and 'files' (list of filename and file data), read during the 'iter' and 'encode' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to a BytesIO object and yields encoded chunks; it does not directly send data or interact with network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'fields' and 'files' is processed and encoded; files are read either from BytesIO objects or via their 'read' method; data is written to a BytesIO buffer as a multipart/form-data body.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of getencoder and guess_type functions are standard. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code present. Exception handling only logs errors without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs multipart/form-data payloads by encoding form fields and files with proper boundaries and content headers. It uses standard library functions for encoding and MIME type guessing. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a utility for form data encoding, which is common and benign. No anomalous or suspicious patterns were identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard multipart/form-data encoder utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on provided input data without external interactions or side effects. Overall, it appears safe and intended for legitimate file upload purposes.",
