{
  "purpose": "This code creates multipart/form-data payloads for HTTP requests, encoding fields and files appropriately.",
  "sources": "Input fields (name-value pairs) and files (filename, file data) provided to the iter() method.",
  "sinks": "The yielded chunks are written into a BytesIO object in encode(), which produces the final payload; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Source data (fields and files) are processed in iter(), encoded, and yielded; encode() collects these chunks into a BytesIO buffer, producing the final multipart/form-data bytes.",
  "anomalies": "The iter() method yields a tuple (chunk, length) for file data, which is then written into BytesIO; exception handling only prints errors, not raising them, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard multipart/form-data encoder, using common libraries and practices. It handles string/bytes conversions, boundary creation, and file reading correctly. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The exception handling is minimal but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code. No network activity or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for encoding multipart/form-data payloads with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
