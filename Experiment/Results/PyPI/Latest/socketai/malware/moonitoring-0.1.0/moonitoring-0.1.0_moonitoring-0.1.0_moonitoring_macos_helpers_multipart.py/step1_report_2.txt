{
  "purpose": "Creates and encodes multipart/form-data content for HTTP requests, supporting fields and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (fields and files), reads file content via file objects or BytesIO.",
  "sinks": "Generates multipart/form-data content, yields encoded chunks, writes to BytesIO buffer.",
  "flows": "Input data (fields and files) → encoding functions and iter method → yield encoded parts → assemble into final request body.",
  "anomalies": "Uses getencoder for UTF-8 encoding but lacks explicit validation of file inputs; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs multipart/form-data bodies for HTTP requests, handling fields and files. It properly encodes data, manages boundary strings, and yields chunks for streaming. No suspicious operations, such as network calls, data leaks, or backdoors, are present. The handling of file data via BytesIO or file objects appears standard. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose aligns with typical file upload handling, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for encoding multipart/form-data for HTTP uploads, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not include any malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
