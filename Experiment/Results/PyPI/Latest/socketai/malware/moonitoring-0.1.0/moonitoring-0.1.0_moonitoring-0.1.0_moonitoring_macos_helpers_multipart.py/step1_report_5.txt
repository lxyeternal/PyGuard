{
  "purpose": "Creates and encodes multipart/form-data content type for HTTP requests, allowing the inclusion of form fields and files.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: fields, files, and internal attributes like __boundary. Reads file data via filelike objects (BytesIO or BinaryIO).",
  "sinks": "Data yielded for HTTP body construction, potentially sent over network if integrated into a request.",
  "flows": "Fields are processed and encoded into multipart format; files are read and included in the encoded output; the boundary is generated and used as part of the data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs standard multipart/form-data encoding without obfuscation or malicious patterns. No dynamic code execution or hidden network activity. No sensitive data leakage or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation for encoding form data and files for HTTP requests. It uses safe library functions, handles different data types properly, and generates a boundary for multipart encoding. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. It primarily acts as a utility for HTTP data formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for multipart/form-data encoding without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
