  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for creating ASCII tables from data and running a process with optional arguments, then returning a Data object.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'header', 'rows', 'process', and 'arguments' passed into functions.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not write to files, send data over networks, or execute system commands directly.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parameters into functions; 'create_table' processes headers and rows; 'run_process' invokes process with or without arguments and calls 'run()'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'yield' in 'create_table' suggests generator usage; no input sanitization or validation is visible; 'process' is called dynamically with arguments, which could be risky if 'process' is malicious or untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The 'create_table' function constructs an ASCII table by calculating column widths and yielding lines; no malicious code is present, but it uses dynamic string formatting. The 'run_process' function calls a 'process' object's 'run()' method, optionally with arguments. Since 'process' and 'arguments' are passed dynamically, if untrusted, they could be exploited for malicious actions, such as executing arbitrary code. However, based solely on this code, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for formatting tables and running processes with optional arguments. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected within this code snippet. The main security consideration is the dynamic invocation of 'process' with 'arguments', which could pose risks if 'process' is untrusted, but this depends on external context. Overall, the code appears benign.",
