{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating text-based tables and running processes, likely for internal data presentation and process management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (header, rows, process, arguments) and imports from an external module 'moonitoring.macos.helpers.dataclasses.Data'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs generated table strings via yield, and returns a Data object from run_process. There are no apparent data sinks that send data externally or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (header, rows, process, arguments) flow into the table creation functions; 'process' and 'arguments' flow into run_process to execute and return data; outputs are generated or returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code appears straightforward, with typical utility functions. No external network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The create_table function generates a formatted table using string operations, with no execution of untrusted code or external data. The run_process function dynamically invokes a process's run method or creates an instance and then runs it, which could be risky if 'process' is malicious, but there's no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. Import statements are from a local module, and there are no suspicious code injections or backdoors. Overall, the code is standard utility functions without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for table rendering and process execution, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
