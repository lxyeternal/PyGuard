{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating ASCII tables and running processes with optional arguments.",
  "sources": "The 'rows' parameter in create_table; the 'process' and 'arguments' parameters in run_process.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('rows', 'process', 'arguments') into functions and outputs, with no external or untrusted network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. The only potential concern is the use of 'process' which could be any object, but the code safely invokes 'run()' methods without apparent malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The create_table function constructs a textual ASCII table from headers and rows, utilizing straightforward string manipulation and generator functions. The run_process function dynamically calls a process object with optional arguments, then executes its run method. Both functions perform simple, standard operations with no network or security-sensitive actions. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The use of dynamic invocation ('process(*arguments).run()') is flexible but not inherently suspicious, assuming trusted inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions for formatting and process execution, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It does not handle untrusted inputs in a way that would pose a security threat, nor does it perform malicious actions.",
