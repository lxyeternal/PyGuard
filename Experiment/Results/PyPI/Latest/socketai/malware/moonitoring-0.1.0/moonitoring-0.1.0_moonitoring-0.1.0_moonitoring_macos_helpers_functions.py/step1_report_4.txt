{
  "purpose": "The code generates textual tables from headers and rows, and runs a process with optional arguments, returning a Data object.",
  "sources": "Data imported from moonitoring.macos.helpers.dataclasses; process parameter used in run_process function; process arguments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes to external data sinks or network endpoints; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters (header, rows, process, arguments) flows through to output via string generation or process execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The table generator uses generator functions but no malicious code execution. The run_process function calls a process object potentially with arguments but does not perform suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The create_table function constructs an ASCII table using string manipulation and generators, with no external or sensitive operations. The run_process function conditionally executes a process object, passing arguments if provided, and calls its run method. There is no evidence of malicious code, code injection, or hidden backdoors. Both functions appear straightforward and serve utility purposes. No suspicious external data access or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility module for creating ASCII tables and running processes. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
