  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating ASCII tables and executing process objects with optional arguments.",
  "sources": "Input data for create_table: header list and rows list; for run_process: process object and optional arguments tuple.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "create_table processes header and row data to produce formatted strings; run_process invokes process(*arguments).run() and returns Data.",
  "anomalies": "Potential issue if 'rows' is empty in create_table (index error); no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with create_table generating ASCII tables via string formatting and run_process executing a process object dynamically. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The dynamic invocation of process(*arguments).run() could be risky if 'process' is untrusted, but this is external to the code. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature. The main concern is trusting 'process' and 'arguments' externally, but within this snippet, no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of 'process' and 'arguments' when used externally. The assigned scores are appropriate, reflecting low risk and no malware.",
