  "conclusion": "The code is benign in structure but suspicious due to module names indicating malicious capabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a malware score around 0.75 and a risk score around 0.75–0.8, reflecting high suspicion based on naming conventions. Further investigation into the imported modules is necessary to confirm malicious behavior."
