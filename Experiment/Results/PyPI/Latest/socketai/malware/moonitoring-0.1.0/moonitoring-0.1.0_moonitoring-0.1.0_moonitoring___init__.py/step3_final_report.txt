  "purpose": "Platform detection and conditional import of modules related to system monitoring and keylogging, with module names suggesting malicious intent.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call for OS detection",
  "sinks": "Import statements that load potentially malicious modules; actual malicious activity depends on imported modules' implementation",
  "flows": "OS detection leads to conditional import of Windows-specific module; all modules are imported regardless of platform",
  "anomalies": "Module names such as 'MacStealer', 'WindowsStealer', and 'InputMonitor' strongly suggest malicious or surveillance functionalities",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing platform detection and importing modules. No obfuscation or malicious code is visible here. The suspicion arises solely from module names, which imply malicious intent. The scores across reports (malware 0.2–0.75, risk 0.4–0.8) are based on this suspicion. Given the module names, a high suspicion is justified, but without inspecting the modules' implementations, actual malicious activity cannot be confirmed. The overall assessment should reflect high suspicion due to naming, balanced with the benign nature of the code structure itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in structure but suspicious due to module names indicating malicious capabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a malware score around 0.75 and a risk score around 0.75–0.8, reflecting high suspicion based on naming conventions. Further investigation into the imported modules is necessary to confirm malicious behavior.",
