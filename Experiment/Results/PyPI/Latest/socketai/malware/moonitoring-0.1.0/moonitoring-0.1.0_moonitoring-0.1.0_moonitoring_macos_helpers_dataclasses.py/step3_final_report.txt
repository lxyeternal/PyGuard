  "purpose": "Define data structures for representing files and fields within a data package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines default attribute values within class declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code is purely structural with no data flow beyond class definitions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process data at runtime, only declares data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward use of dataclasses with default values.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two dataclasses, 'Field' and 'Data', with default attribute values. There are no functions, I/O, external data access, or dynamic code execution. The code serves solely as a data schema, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The absence of any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads indicates a benign purpose. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary, and the code is considered safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, safe data structure definition with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately assess its benign nature, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics. No further concerns are warranted.",
