  "sources": "No external input sources; data is defined via class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only class definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected; code is purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple data class definitions with no executable logic, data processing, or external input handling. It uses standard Python typing and dataclasses to define structures. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The code is straightforward and appears intended for defining data schemas.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely defines data structures without any malicious intent or security risks.",
