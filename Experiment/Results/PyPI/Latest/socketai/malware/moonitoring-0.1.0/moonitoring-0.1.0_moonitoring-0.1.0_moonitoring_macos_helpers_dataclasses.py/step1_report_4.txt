  "purpose": "Define data structures using dataclasses for handling files and fields in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None (no input or external data sources)",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network calls, or file operations)",
  "flows": "None (no data flow or processing beyond class definitions)",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code execution, dynamic code, or security-sensitive operations; straightforward data class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares two dataclasses, Field and Data, with default attribute values. There are no functions, no input/output operations, no use of external data sources, and no suspicious code constructs. The code is purely structural, designed to hold data in a type-safe manner. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple, benign definition of data classes for holding structured data. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected. The code appears safe and intended solely for data management purposes.",
