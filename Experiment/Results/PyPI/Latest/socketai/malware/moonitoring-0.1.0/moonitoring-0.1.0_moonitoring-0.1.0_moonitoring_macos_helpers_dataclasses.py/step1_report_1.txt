  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling files and fields, likely for data processing or configuration.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No output, data transmission, or external interaction present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no input/output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of dataclasses is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code declares two data classes: 'Field' with default attributes for name and value, and 'Data' with lists for files and fields. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external data access. The code appears to be simple and intended for data modeling without any malicious behavior or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data structure definition with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and straightforward.",
