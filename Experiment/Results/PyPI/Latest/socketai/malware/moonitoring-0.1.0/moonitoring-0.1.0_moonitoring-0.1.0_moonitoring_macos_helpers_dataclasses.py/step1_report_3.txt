  "purpose": "Define data structures using dataclasses for handling files and fields.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading operations present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; the code solely defines data structures without behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints and dataclass utilities, then defines two dataclasses: Field with default attributes, and Data with list attributes. There are no functions, input/output operations, or any runtime behavior that could be malicious. The code serves as a schema for data but does not perform any processing, network operations, or data manipulations. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of data structures with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and benign, serving as a schema for further implementation.",
