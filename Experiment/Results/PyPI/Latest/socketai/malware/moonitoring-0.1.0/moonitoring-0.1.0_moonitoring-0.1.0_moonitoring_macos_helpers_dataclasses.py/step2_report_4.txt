  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports: `typing.List`, `typing.Tuple`, `typing.Any`, and `dataclasses.dataclass`.\n- Defines two data classes:\n  - `Field` with default `name` (str) and `value` (Any).\n  - `Data` with `files` (List of Tuples) and `fields` (List of `Field`).\n\n**Review of the code:**\n- No functions, input/output, or external data handling.\n- No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.\n- Serves purely as data structure definitions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the descriptions in all reports.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n- No errors or flaws in reasoning; the analysis is consistent.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n- These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- Confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are uniform and consistent; no adjustments needed.\n- The code is purely structural, so no reason to assign any risk higher than 0.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code poses no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, safe data class definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The provided reports are correct, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
