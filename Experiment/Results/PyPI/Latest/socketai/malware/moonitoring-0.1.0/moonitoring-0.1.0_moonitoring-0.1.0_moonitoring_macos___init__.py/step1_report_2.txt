{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import interface for various modules, classes, and functions likely related to data collection, potentially for malicious purposes such as a stealer or information extractor.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as MacStealer, Telegram, and helper functions that may handle data collection, processing, and communication.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet, but imported components like MacStealer and Telegram suggest potential data exfiltration channels. Helper functions may facilitate data handling.",
  "flows": "Data could flow from imported modules like MacStealer and Wallets (potentially collecting sensitive data) to functions or classes such as Telegram (which might send data externally).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of modules named 'MacStealer' and 'Wallets' indicates possible malicious intent related to data theft. No explicit malicious code is shown here, but the module names themselves are suspicious. Use of generic helper functions and module organization could be intended to obfuscate purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports components related to data theft and communication, suggesting it functions as part of a potentially malicious package. 'MacStealer' implies malicious intent to exfiltrate Mac system data. 'Telegram' may be used for covert communication. Helper functions might facilitate data collection or transmission. The lack of implementation details prevents definitive conclusions, but the module names and structure strongly suggest malicious use.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be part of a malicious data theft toolkit, likely aimed at stealing system and wallet data and transmitting it via Telegram. The module names indicate malicious intent, though no active malicious code is visible in this snippet.",
