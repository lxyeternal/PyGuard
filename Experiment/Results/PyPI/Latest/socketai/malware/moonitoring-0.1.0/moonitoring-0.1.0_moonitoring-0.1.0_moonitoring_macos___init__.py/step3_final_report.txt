{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules related to data collection, exfiltration, and helper functions, potentially for malicious activities such as data theft or system compromise.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: 'stealer', 'senders', 'helpers', 'modules'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points via 'Telegram' and modules named 'MacStealer', 'Wallets'.",
  "flows": "Data could flow from 'MacStealer', 'Wallets' to 'Telegram' for exfiltration, but no actual data flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of module names like 'MacStealer' and 'Wallets' suggest malicious intent; no obfuscation or malicious code is visible in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements, with no active malicious logic. The module names are suspicious and suggest potential malicious use, but without implementation details, this is speculative. High malware and risk scores are based solely on naming conventions, which can be misleading. The obfuscation score is correctly zero. The scores should be lowered to reflect the absence of active malicious code, perhaps to malware 0.3 and risk 0.4, unless further analysis confirms malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in content but contains module names indicative of malicious intent. The current high scores overstate the actual risk based solely on naming; further investigation into module contents is necessary for confirmation.",
