{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to a specified server, then set up a Python package named 'pxz'.",
  "sources": "URL request to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP, os.uname() for hostname, environment variables for home directory, current working directory, and the server URL for data transmission.",
  "sinks": "The GET request to 'http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php' where system data is sent; standard output for print statements.",
  "flows": "The code gathers system info from sources, encodes it as URL parameters, then transmits it via an HTTP GET request to an internal IP address. The flow involves data collection, encoding, and transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic data exfiltration without user consent, and sending system info to an internal IP address which could be a command and control server or malicious actor. The data collection occurs upon import execution, which is hidden within a setup script, and the info sent includes hostname, IP, home, and current directory, possibly for reconnaissance.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system information such as public IP, hostname, home directory, and current directory. It then constructs a URL to send this info via a GET request to a specified server. The use of 'https://api.ipify.org' to get the public IP is standard but can be used maliciously if the data is exfiltrated without user consent. Sending data to 'http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php' suggests it is communicating with an internal or malicious server. The code executes immediately upon import, which is unusual for a setup script, indicating possible malicious intent to collect and transmit data stealthily. The package setup is typical, but the embedded data exfiltration is suspicious and indicates a potential backdoor or data theft mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded functionality that automatically collects and transmits system information to an internal IP address, which could be malicious. This behavior is hidden within a package setup script and executes on import, suggesting an intent to secretly gather user system data. The overall risk is high due to data exfiltration and lack of user consent.",
