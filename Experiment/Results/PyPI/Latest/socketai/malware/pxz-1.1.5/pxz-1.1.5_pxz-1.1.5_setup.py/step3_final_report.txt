{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory) and silently transmits it to a specified internal server URL immediately upon import or execution, without user consent or notification.",
  "sources": "urlopen('https://api.ipify.org'), os.uname().nodename, os.path.expanduser('~'), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "Constructed URL with system info parameters, urlopen(req) to send data to 'http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php'",
  "flows": "Source functions (public IP, hostname, directories) -> URL parameter encoding -> HTTP GET request to internal server",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of data collection upon module load, transmission to internal IP, no user consent, straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs automatic collection of sensitive system info and transmits it silently to an internal IP address via an HTTP GET request, executed immediately upon import. The data includes public IP, hostname, home directory, and current directory, which are sent without user notification or consent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the transmission occurs over plain HTTP, indicating potential malicious intent. The use of an internal IP suggests covert data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The setup() function is standard and unrelated to the malicious activity. Given these behaviors, the code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, with high security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.75-0.9, security risk 0.75-0.9, obfuscation 0) are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates covert, automatic collection and transmission of sensitive system information to an internal server, indicative of malicious or backdoor activity. The high scores assigned are appropriate, reflecting significant security concern. The straightforward nature of the code and the immediate execution upon load further support the malicious suspicion. It is recommended to treat this package as potentially malicious and conduct further investigation.",
