{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to a specified server, alongside defining a Python package setup configuration.",
  "sources": "URL request to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP; os.uname() for hostname; os.path.expanduser('~') for home directory; os.getcwd() for current directory; hardcoded server URL 'http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php'.",
  "sinks": "URL request to the internal server with system info as URL parameters, printing status messages.",
  "flows": "Source: Public IP and system info variables → URL construction → GET request to internal server → Output based on response.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically sends system info to an internal IP address without user consent, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. The server URL is hardcoded. No user input validation or consent prompt. Use of system info collection and transmission in a package setup context is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info (public IP, hostname, home, current directory) and sends it to a specified internal IP address without any indication of user approval. The data is sent via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or surveillance activity, especially since it operates immediately upon import. The package setup code itself appears standard and benign but is coupled with the data collection and transmission code, which is suspicious. The use of an internal IP for data transmission may indicate control or malicious intent, especially if the user is unaware.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains potentially malicious behavior by collecting and sending system information to an internal IP address without user consent, which is characteristic of data exfiltration or surveillance. The setup function itself appears legitimate but is coupled with malicious side effects. The overall risk is high due to covert data transmission.",
