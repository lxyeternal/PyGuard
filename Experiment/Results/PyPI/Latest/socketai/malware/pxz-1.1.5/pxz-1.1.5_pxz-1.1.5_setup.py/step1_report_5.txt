  "purpose": "Collects and sends system information including public IP, hostname, home directory, and current directory to a specified server URL.",
  "sources": "URLError exception handling, urlopen call to 'https://api.ipify.org', os.uname().nodename, os.path.expanduser(\"~\"), os.getcwd(), URL construction and request to 'http://10.0.2.15:8080/collect_info.php'.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP GET request to an external server with collected system info.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from the system and URL parameters are constructed. The data is then sent via an HTTP GET request to the specified server URL.",
  "anomalies": "Code actively collects system info and transmits it without user consent or obvious purpose related to package functionality; uses a local IP address (10.0.2.15) potentially for command and control; no visible input validation or security controls around data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules for network requests and system info. It defines a function that collects the machine's public IP address, hostname, home directory, and current working directory. It then constructs a URL with these parameters and sends a GET request to a hardcoded local IP address (10.0.2.15) which could serve as a command-and-control server or data collection point. The collected data is transmitted without encryption or user consent. The setup() function declares package metadata and dependencies, which are standard. Overall, the code performs system info gathering and exfiltration with no clear benign purpose, indicating potentially malicious intent or backdoor-like behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting sensitive system information and exfiltrating it to a local network address, which is suspicious and could be malicious. It does not serve a clear legitimate purpose within the package functionality, raising concerns about clandestine data collection.",
