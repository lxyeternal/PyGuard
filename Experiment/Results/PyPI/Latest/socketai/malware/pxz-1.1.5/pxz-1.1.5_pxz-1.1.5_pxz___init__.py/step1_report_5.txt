{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that initializes some variables and performs basic operations, possibly intended for demonstration or as a utility function.",
  "sources": "Reading input from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to console, logs, network transmission, or file writing mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (user input, environment variables) flows into processing functions, then to outputs or external communication endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code constructs detected. No obfuscated or complex dynamic code execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes variables and performs standard operations with no evident malicious intent. No external data sources or sinks are explicitly identified, nor are there any suspicious data flows. The code structure is straightforward, lacking any hidden or obfuscated logic. Absence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with standard programming constructs and no suspicious patterns.",
