  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates patterns that could be exploited maliciously but does not contain confirmed malware. The suspicion is moderate, justified by eval() and network activity. Scores are adjusted to reflect this: malware at 0.4, obfuscation at 0.2, and security risk at 0.5, aligning with the observed behaviors and analysis."
