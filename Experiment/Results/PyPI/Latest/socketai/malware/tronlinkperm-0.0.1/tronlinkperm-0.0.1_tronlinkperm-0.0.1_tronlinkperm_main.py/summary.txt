  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating private keys to an external server without safeguards. The presence of typos and improper data structures suggest poor coding or obfuscation. The behavior warrants a high malware score (~0.75), high security risk (~0.8), and moderate obfuscation (~0.3). Overall, the code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, primarily due to private key leakage."
