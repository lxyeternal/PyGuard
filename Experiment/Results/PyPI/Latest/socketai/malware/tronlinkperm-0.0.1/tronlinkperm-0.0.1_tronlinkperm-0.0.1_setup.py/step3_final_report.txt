  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tronlinkperm' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious placeholder email address ('7f861781ed@emaily.pro'), but no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, user input, or network activity. The only unusual element is the email address, which appears to be a placeholder or autogenerated, not malicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no malware or security vulnerabilities. The email address's suspicious appearance does not translate into malicious intent but warrants minor concern. Overall, the script is benign, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The only minor concern is the placeholder email address, which does not pose a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to the suspicious email. No further action needed.",
