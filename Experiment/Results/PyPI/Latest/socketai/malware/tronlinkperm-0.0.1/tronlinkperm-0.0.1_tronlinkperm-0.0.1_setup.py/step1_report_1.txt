{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'tronlinkperm', including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup and find_packages from setuptools; reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for package description; passes static metadata to setup function; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The email address appears autogenerated or placeholder but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and source URL. All code is static, with no input validation, dynamic code execution, or external untrusted data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward and standard in structure.",
