  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a simple relative import: `from .main import perm`.\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no suspicious behavior, no embedded code, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is high (1), malware is 0, security risk is 0.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that this is benign and standard is correct. The import statement itself is harmless.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, a straightforward import statement.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is benign.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same import statement, minimal code.\n- **Findings:** No malicious indicators, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, malware 0, risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score is very low (0.1), which is acceptable given the minimal code. The malware score remains 0.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same import statement.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, no data flow, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The import is benign.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same import statement.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, standard import.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- All reports agree that this code snippet is a simple import statement with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, aligning with the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the minimal and straightforward code.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports and consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is appropriate.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a standard, benign import statement with no security concerns.",
