  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module, likely for use within the package or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module file 'main.py' in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed in this snippet; import is static and does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement. No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'perm' from a local module 'main'. As it contains only this single import statement, there are no observable malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious activities. It appears to be a standard import, with no embedded malicious intent or obfuscation. Without additional context or code, no further malicious analysis can be performed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a symbol from a local module, which is common in Python codebases.",
