  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' function or variable from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module file 'main' located in the same package/directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; this code only performs an import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only a single import statement with relative import syntax. No anomalies detected in isolation.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement using relative import syntax to include 'perm' from a module named 'main' in the same package. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs; no suspicious or malicious behavior is present in this fragment. Since it's only an import, it cannot be malicious by itself. No embedded code, obfuscated code, or network activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import operation. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
