  "purpose": "This code imports the 'perm' object from a local module named 'main' within the same package, serving to include functionality or data defined there.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data sources or inputs are read within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply imports a module component without further data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward relative import with no obfuscation, embedded code, or suspicious constructs. No anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement: 'from .main import perm'. It involves no data flow, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence levels. The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the code's clarity. The security risk score is effectively 0, as the code does not introduce any security concerns. The scores are consistent with the code's simple and standard nature. No further analysis or action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a benign, standard Python import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's harmless nature. No modifications or additional scrutiny are required.",
