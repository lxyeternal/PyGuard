  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the provided code snippet:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .main import perm\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code is a simple relative import statement.\n- It imports `perm` from a module named `main` located in the same package.\n- There are no additional operations, data flows, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation, embedded code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code appears standard for Python package/module structure.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign import, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is harmless.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Standard relative import, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Straightforward import, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) may be justified if considering that import statements could potentially be exploited in some attack vectors, but in isolation, this is very low risk. Overall, acceptable.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Standard import, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Minimal import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. Import statements alone are not malicious unless combined with malicious code elsewhere.\n- Obfuscated score is 0 in all reports, consistent with the straightforward import.\n\n### Overall Risk:\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, which is reasonable given the minimal nature of the code.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard Python relative import statement.\n- No embedded malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The minimal code and context strongly suggest a benign operation.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: a simple import statement with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
