  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' function or object from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'main' to access 'perm'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external output is directly involved.",
  "flows": "Imports 'perm' from 'main' module without additional data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a simple import statement with no additional logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement that brings 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration. The import appears straightforward and typical in Python projects. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or suspicious constructs are present. Since the code is minimal, it offers no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate and standard for Python modules.",
