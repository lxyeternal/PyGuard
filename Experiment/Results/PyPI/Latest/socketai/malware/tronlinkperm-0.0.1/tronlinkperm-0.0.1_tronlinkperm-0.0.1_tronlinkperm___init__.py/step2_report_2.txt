  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple relative import of 'perm' from a local module 'main'.\n- No code execution, data flow, or network activity is involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are very low or zero, consistent with the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code snippet is just a single import statement:\n  ```python\n  from .main import perm\n  ```\n- This is a standard Python import; no issues are present in the code itself.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that this is a benign import statement.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are minimal, which makes sense given the simplicity.\n- The only potential point of discussion is the **securityRisk** score in report 3 (0.1). Given the code's benign nature, this could be lowered to 0 for consistency.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5; all are very low, which is appropriate.\n- Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious activity, a higher risk score isn't justified.\n\n### Malware scores:\n- Correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n- The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or indicators.\n\n### Assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- No assumptions are made that could lead to false positives.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, harmless import statement. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code fragment is benign. The scores and analysis are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
