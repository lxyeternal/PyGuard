      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during package installation, representing a significant security concern. The behavior is malicious, justifying high malware and risk scores. Existing assessments are generally accurate, but some underestimate the severity. The overall threat level is high due to silent privacy violations, warranting a malware score of 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.8."
