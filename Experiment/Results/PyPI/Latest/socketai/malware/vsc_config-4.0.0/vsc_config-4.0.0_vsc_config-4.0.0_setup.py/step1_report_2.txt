{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that sends system information to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - collecting hostname, current working directory, and username; requests.get() - sending data to remote URL",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call that transmits data to an external URL, potentially leaking system information",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) are collected and then sent via the requests.get() call to the specified URL",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request during package installation without user consent or explicit warning, which is unusual and potentially malicious. No comments or documentation indicate this behavior; the URL is a seemingly random domain. No error handling or validation is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a custom install class. During the run method, it gathers system information: hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL with this data as parameters. This network activity occurs automatically upon package installation, which is suspicious as it can be used for tracking or exfiltration without user knowledge. The URL appears to be a randomly generated domain, suggesting potential command and control or data collection purposes. No other suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious behavior: sending system information to a remote server during package installation without user awareness. This is a security concern and could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration.",
