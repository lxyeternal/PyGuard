  "purpose": "Customize the installation process of a Python package to collect system information and send it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, and username from the system; makes an HTTP GET request to a remote URL with this data.",
  "sinks": "requests.get call that sends data over the network to an external server.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, cwd, username) are collected as sources, then sent via requests.get to the specified URL as parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system information to an external server without user consent; the target URL appears suspicious and may be used for tracking or data exfiltration. No validation or encryption is used for the data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that extends setuptools' install. During the run method, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then makes a GET request to a specified external URL with these details as parameters. The URL appears suspicious, possibly used for tracking or malicious data collection. No safeguards, encryption, or user notifications are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions directly on the system but facilitates covert data exfiltration during package installation, which is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by collecting system information and transmitting it to a remote server without user consent. This behavior can be used for tracking, profiling, or further malicious activities. The use of an unusual URL and silent data transmission during installation are suspicious and constitute a security risk.",
