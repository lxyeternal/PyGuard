  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and sends it to a specified remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()) during the run method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP GET request to 'https://468dsoou932zmzkp79cjaogzzq5ht9hy.oastify.com', potentially transmitting sensitive system info.",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, and username sources are included as URL parameters in the requests.get call, which transmits the information to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and is likely a temporary or malicious domain used for tracking or reconnaissance. The code collects system info during installation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via a GET request to an external URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking. No user input validation or permission checks are present. The use of a seemingly random or malicious domain indicates potential malicious intent. The code runs during the package installation, which could be used for malicious surveillance or unauthorized data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by collecting system info and transmitting it to an external server during package installation, likely without user consent. It could be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or other malicious activities. The presence of a suspicious domain and the silent data exfiltration increase the maliciousness score.",
