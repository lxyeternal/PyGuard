{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that installs a custom installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() during the run method of CustomInstall.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data to an external URL, which can leak system information.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, current working directory, username) flows directly into the requests.get URL as parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an external network request during installation without user consent, sending system information to a remote server. The URL used looks suspicious and potentially malicious. No validation or encryption of data. No error handling or user notification is present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install class that, upon installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a remote URL, passing this data as parameters. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking without user knowledge. The URL appears to be suspicious and could be part of a malicious supply chain attack. There are no obfuscation techniques, but the silent network activity during installation is suspicious. The code does not include any other malicious payloads, but the behavior is potentially malicious due to data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs unintended data exfiltration during package installation by sending system info to an external server. It is highly suspicious and could be malicious, indicative of a privacy violation or supply chain attack.",
