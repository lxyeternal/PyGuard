{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security and malicious potential of a simple relative import statement in Python code.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data or input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it execute any malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a straightforward import with no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code 'from .main import perm' is a standard relative import in Python, indicating no malicious intent or security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware scores are appropriately zero, and the obfuscated scores are zero as well. The security risk scores in reports 2 and 3 are slightly overestimated at 0.1; given the minimal code, these should be lowered to 0 for consistency. Confidence levels are high across all reports due to the simplicity of the code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The import statement alone does not pose a security threat, and without additional context, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard relative import with no malicious or suspicious elements. The existing scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to the security risk scores in some reports. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
