  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'main' module within the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this line.",
  "flows": "Imports data from a local module; no data flow analysis applicable here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple relative import of 'perm' from a local module 'main'. It is a standard Python import statement with no embedded logic, no dynamic execution, and no external data handling. The minimal nature of the code does not suggest any malicious intent or obfuscation. Since no other context or code is provided, no indicators of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and typical for modular Python projects.",
