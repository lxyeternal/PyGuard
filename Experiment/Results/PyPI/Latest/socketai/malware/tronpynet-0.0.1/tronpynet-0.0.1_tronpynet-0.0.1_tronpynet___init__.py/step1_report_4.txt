  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'main' through an import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Imports 'perm' from 'main', establishing a dependency link but no data flow is demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement that pulls 'perm' from a sibling module 'main'. It does not execute any code, perform I/O, or include malicious constructs. The minimal nature suggests it is likely part of a larger program. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden code, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It simply establishes a dependency on another module.",
