  "purpose": "The code appears to import a function or variable named 'perm' from a local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads 'perm' from the local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet; no data processing, output, or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this minimal code snippet; the import does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, only performing an import. There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports 'perm' from a local module 'main'. Without additional context, it does not perform any actions, data processing, or external communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The snippet is typical of modular Python code and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, minimal import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
