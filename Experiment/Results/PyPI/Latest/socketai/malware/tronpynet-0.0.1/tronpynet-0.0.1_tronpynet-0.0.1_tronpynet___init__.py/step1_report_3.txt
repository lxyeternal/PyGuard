  "purpose": "The code imports a function or variable named 'perm' from a local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only an import statement without data flow",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; only a simple import statement, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. There are no data inputs, user interactions, or network activities. The import itself is standard Python syntax, and no additional code is provided that could indicate malicious behavior or security risks. Without further context or usage of 'perm', there are no indications of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a minimal and benign code fragment.",
