  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Content**: Simple relative import of `perm` from `.main`.\n   - **Assessment**: The code is a straightforward import statement with no logic, data flow, or external communication.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — correct; no malicious behavior.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — accurate; code is clear.\n     - Security Risk: 0 — appropriate; minimal code.\n   - **Conclusion**: Valid, no issues detected.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Content**: Same import as above.\n   - **Assessment**: Again, a minimal import with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n     - Security Risk: 0.1 — slightly elevated, but given the code's simplicity, this might be overly cautious.\n   - **Justification**: Since it's just an import, unless there's context indicating malicious intent, a security risk score of 0.1 seems unwarranted.\n   - **Recommendation**: Reduce `securityRisk` to 0 for consistency with other reports and the code's benign nature.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Content**: Same minimal import.\n   - **Assessment**: No suspicious activity.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n     - Security Risk: 0.1 — again, possibly too high.\n   - **Recommendation**: Same as above, set to 0.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Content**: Same import statement.\n   - **Assessment**: No malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n     - Security Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Fully consistent.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Content**: Same import.\n   - **Assessment**: No issues.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - Malware: 0 — correct.\n     - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n     - Security Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- All reports analyze the same minimal import statement.\n- None identify actual malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only inconsistency is the `securityRisk` score in reports 2 and 3, which are set at 0.1 despite the code's benign nature.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 across all reports — consistent and correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 across all reports — consistent.\n- **Risk Score**:\n  - For reports 2 and 3, I suggest lowering from 0.1 to 0, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n  - For reports 1, 4, and 5, keep at 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The minimal code and lack of external interactions do not justify any risk score above zero.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of action points:**\n\n- Adjust `securityRisk` scores in reports 2 and 3 to 0.\n- Confirm that all scores reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to prepare a revised summary report based on these findings.",
