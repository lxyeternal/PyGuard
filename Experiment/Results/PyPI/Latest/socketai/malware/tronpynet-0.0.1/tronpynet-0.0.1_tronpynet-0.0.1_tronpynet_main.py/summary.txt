  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high security risk primarily through private key exfiltration to external servers, with signs of obfuscation via a typo. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, the pattern indicates potential malicious intent. The malware score is approximately 0.75, obfuscation around 0.2, and security risk near 0.8, warranting caution and further review."
