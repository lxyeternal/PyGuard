  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; all code is standard for Python package setup. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No external input processing or untrusted data handling observed. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
