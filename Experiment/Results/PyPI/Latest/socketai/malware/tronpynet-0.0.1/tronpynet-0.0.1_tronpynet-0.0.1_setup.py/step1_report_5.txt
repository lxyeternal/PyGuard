  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging the 'tronpynet' Python library, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; static assignment of package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Read from the README.md file as input; metadata and dependencies are statically defined and used in setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed. The code performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for packaging, reads the README file for long description, and invokes setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and repository URL. All operations are standard and straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply configures the package metadata and dependencies.",
