  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tronpynet' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; retrieves package information and dependencies for setup.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data effects.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description -> executes package setup with specified parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging. It imports necessary modules, reads a README file for the long description, and configures package metadata including name, version, author info, dependencies, and URL. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. All actions are consistent with standard package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign and standard setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
