  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'tronpynet' library, performing static configuration without dynamic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, static metadata in setup() call, package dependencies ('requests')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity, external data processing, or code execution",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setup() configuration; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment '#Add a comma here' after 'install_requires' list, which is a minor, non-functional anomaly; no malicious anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence scores. No suspicious behaviors, secrets, or external communications are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and aligned with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
