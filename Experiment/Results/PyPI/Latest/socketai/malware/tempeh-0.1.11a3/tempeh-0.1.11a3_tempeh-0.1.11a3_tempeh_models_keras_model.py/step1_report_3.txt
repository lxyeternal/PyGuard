{
  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes and functions for creating and training Keras-based deep learning models (classification and regression) for use within a larger framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as keras, tensorflow, numpy; reads model parameters; reads dataset attributes like size and features.",
  "sinks": "Model training (`model.fit`) with dataset data; potential use of dataset attributes; no obvious data leak points or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Dataset data (`X`, `y`) flows into model creation functions, then into `model.fit` for training; no external untrusted input flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard model creation and training functions; suppresses stderr during import; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code features; no suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports known libraries, suppresses error messages during import, and defines classes for model wrappers. The functions create neural network models for different tasks, training them with dataset data. No hardcoded credentials, network communication, or suspicious operations are present. Use of dataset attributes is standard. The suppression of stderr during import is a minor concern but is not malicious. Overall, the code appears to implement legitimate model training logic with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for defining and training Keras models, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and purposefully designed for model creation within a larger framework.",
