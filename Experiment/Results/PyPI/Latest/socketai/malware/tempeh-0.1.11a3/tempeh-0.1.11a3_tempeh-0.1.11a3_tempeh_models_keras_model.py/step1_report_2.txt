{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions to create and train various Keras deep neural network models for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as keras and tensorflow; accesses dataset attributes like _X_train, _y_train; uses np.unique; reads dataset sizes.",
  "sinks": "Uses model.fit to train models; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset attributes into model creation functions, then into model training methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically suppresses stderr output during imports, which could hide import errors. The _common_model_generator function adds layers with a potentially confusing activation ('relu') for the final Dense layer in regression models, which might be unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Keras model wrappers for different tasks, with functions to generate models and train them on provided datasets. It suppresses stderr during imports, possibly to hide errors but does not introduce malicious behavior. Model creation and training routines are standard, and no suspicious data flows or code patterns are present. No anomalies such as hidden network connections, data leaks, or backdoors are detected. All operations are typical for machine learning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of model wrappers for machine learning tasks, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. The suppression of error messages during imports is notable but not malicious; it may impact debugging. Overall, the code does not exhibit malware, malicious data handling, or security risks.",
