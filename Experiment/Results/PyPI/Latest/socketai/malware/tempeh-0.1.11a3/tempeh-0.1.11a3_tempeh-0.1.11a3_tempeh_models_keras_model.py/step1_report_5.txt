{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and functions for creating and wrapping Keras deep neural network models for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (keras, tensorflow), file system operations (os, sys), and dataset properties (dataset parameters).",
  "sinks": "Model compilation, model fitting with training data, and potential use of data for training models.",
  "flows": "External data (X, y) flows into model training functions, which compile and fit models. Model objects are instantiated and trained with provided datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of standard Keras/TensorFlow functions, with no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides model creation wrappers for Keras neural networks, including binary, multiclass, and regression models. It suppresses TensorFlow logging, imports necessary modules, and defines functions for model construction, compilation, and training. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is evident. The data passed into training functions is used solely for model fitting. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious system manipulations present. The overall structure is straightforward and aligned with common deep learning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate model wrapper code for machine learning tasks using Keras and TensorFlow, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It employs standard practices and functions for creating and training neural networks without any suspicious behavior.",
