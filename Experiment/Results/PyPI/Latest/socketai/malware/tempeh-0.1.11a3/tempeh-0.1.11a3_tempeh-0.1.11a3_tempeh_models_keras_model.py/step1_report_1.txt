  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes for creating and training Keras-based deep learning models for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (keras, tensorflow), reads dataset properties (dataset._X_train, dataset._y_train), reads input data shapes, reads unique labels (np.unique).",
  "sinks": "Model training functions (model.fit) with untrusted input data, potential data leakage through validation_data using same training data, no evident direct untrusted sink for malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Input datasets (X, y) flow into model creation functions, which generate models and call model.fit with the same data as validation, and produce trained models.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. Model creation and training are standard. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a standard implementation of Keras model wrappers with functions to generate simple neural networks for different tasks. It imports standard libraries, suppresses some logs, and defines functions for creating models. The dataset inputs are used directly in model training with no unusual manipulation. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network operations, or other malicious indicators. All functions appear to serve model training purposes only, following typical patterns for deep learning workflows. The validation data is identical to training data, which could be a concern for data leakage but not malicious per se. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious or sabotage behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Keras model wrappers and training routines for classification and regression tasks. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The main concern is data leakage due to using training data as validation data, but this is a standard practice rather than malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors detected.",
