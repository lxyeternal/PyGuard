  "purpose": "Defines Keras-based model classes and functions for classification and regression tasks, wrapping Keras models for use within a larger framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (logging, numpy, os, sys), Keras and TensorFlow modules, and internal modules (.base_model, tempeh.constants). Reads environment variables (via sys.stderr manipulation).",
  "sinks": "Potential model creation and training functions, especially within create_keras_regressor, create_keras_classifier, and create_keras_multiclass_classifier, which execute model.fit() with data X and y.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input datasets into model creation functions, then into model.fit() during training, where data from dataset attributes (_X_train, _y_train) is used for training the models.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sys.stderr redirection to suppress TensorFlow/Keras warnings; no suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code evident. Model creation and training appear standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up standard Keras models for classification and regression, with functions to create and train these models. It suppresses logs from TensorFlow by redirecting sys.stderr temporarily, which is not inherently malicious but could obscure warning messages. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or unusual behaviors are present. The training functions fit models with datasets and do not perform any untrusted data handling or suspicious operations. The overall code structure aligns with typical model wrapper implementations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Keras model wrappers for classification and regression tasks. No malicious behaviors, supply chain attacks, or suspicious activities are detected. The suppression of warnings via stderr redirection is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
