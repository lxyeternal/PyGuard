  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes for Keras deep learning models (classification and regression) to facilitate model creation, training, and compatibility checks within a larger framework.",
  "sources": "Dataset attributes (_X_train, _y_train), dataset size, dataset task and data type, dataset features for model input shape.",
  "sinks": "Model training via model.fit with dataset data; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Dataset data flows directly into model.fit during model creation functions; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Suppression of stderr during import to hide logs; use of 'relu' activation in regression output layer is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard Keras model wrapper classes for classification and regression tasks, with functions to generate simple neural network models. It suppresses logs during import, which could hide errors but is not malicious. The training routines use dataset data directly, with potential for data leakage if used improperly, but this is typical in testing scenarios. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature, minor log suppression concerns notwithstanding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Keras model wrappers with no malicious intent or behavior. The minor suppression of logs is not malicious but could hinder debugging. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal and scores are appropriate.",
