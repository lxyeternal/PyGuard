  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class (ABC) compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements, usage of the 'six' library to check Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; the code is only defining a class compatibility layer.",
  "flows": "The code flow determines the class definition based on Python version, but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'six' library to detect the Python version at runtime. Depending on the version, it imports the appropriate ABC class from the 'abc' module. If Python 3, it imports ABC directly; if Python 2, it imports ABCMeta and creates a compatibility class 'ABC'. This is a common pattern to maintain compatibility across Python versions. No user input, external data, or suspicious logic is involved. The code is simple, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility layer for defining abstract base classes across Python versions. It does not contain malware or security risks, and no suspicious behavior is detected.",
