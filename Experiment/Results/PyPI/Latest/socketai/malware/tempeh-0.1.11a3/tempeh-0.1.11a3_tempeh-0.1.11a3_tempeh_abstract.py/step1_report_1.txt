{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract base class (ABC) that is compatible across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'six' library to detect Python version; imports 'ABC' or 'ABCMeta' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Conditional import flow based on Python version; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Standard compatibility pattern; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'six' for Python version detection and conditionally defines an abstract base class 'ABC' compatible with both Python 2 and 3. It uses standard practices for backward compatibility. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code serves a utility function without any suspicious logic or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility utility for defining ABCs across Python versions. It does not contain malware or security risks, and appears legitimate.",
