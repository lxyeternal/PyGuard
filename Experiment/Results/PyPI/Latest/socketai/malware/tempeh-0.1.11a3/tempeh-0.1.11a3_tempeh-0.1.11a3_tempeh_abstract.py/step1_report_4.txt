  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class (ABC) compatible across Python 2 and 3 using the 'six' compatibility library.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'import six', and conditional imports of 'abc' module components.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data outputs, network calls, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural and compatibility-focused.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; straightforward compatibility implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'six' library to handle Python 2 and 3 compatibility for defining an ABC. It conditionally imports 'ABC' directly for Python 3 or creates a compatible 'ABC' class with 'ABCMeta' for Python 2. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. The code appears to be a standard pattern for ensuring cross-version compatibility for abstract base classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless compatibility layer for defining abstract base classes across Python versions. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
