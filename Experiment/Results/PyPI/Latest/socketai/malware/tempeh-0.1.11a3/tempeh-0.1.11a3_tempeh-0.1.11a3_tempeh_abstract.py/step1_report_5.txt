  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class (ABC) compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'import six', and conditional imports of ABC or ABCMeta based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows related to untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'six' for compatibility is standard; no unusual or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'six' library to handle compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3. It conditionally defines the ABC class or ABCMeta based on the runtime Python version. This is a common pattern to support multiple Python versions and does not contain any malicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is simple, well-structured, and aligns with standard compatibility practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a compatibility layer for defining abstract base classes across Python versions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is benign and does not pose any threat.",
