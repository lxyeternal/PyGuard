  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'ABC' compatible with both Python 2 and 3 using the 'six' library for cross-version support.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'six', conditional imports of 'ABC' or 'ABCMeta' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data handling, or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'six' determines Python version; subsequent import or class definition based on 'six.PY3' check.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation of a compatibility pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'six' to detect Python version. For Python 3, it imports 'ABC' directly; for Python 2, it imports 'ABCMeta' and creates a class 'ABC' with '__metaclass__ = ABCMeta'. This is a standard, well-known pattern for cross-version compatibility. No data flows from untrusted sources, no external calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic are present. The code's purpose is purely utility, with no security concerns or vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify this, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1. The code is benign, straightforward, and widely used in open source projects. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility for defining an abstract base class across Python versions. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
