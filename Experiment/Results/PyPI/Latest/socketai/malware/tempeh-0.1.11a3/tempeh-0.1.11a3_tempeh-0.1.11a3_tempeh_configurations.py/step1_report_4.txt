{
  "purpose": "The code defines datasets and models for machine learning tasks, primarily importing classes and generating dataset instances for training and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tempeh.datasets', 'tempeh.models', and 'tempeh.constants'; dataset generation calls via 'generate_dataset_class' methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks found; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it interact with external systems or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "Imports and dataset/model instantiations; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; dataset generation is internal and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; straightforward dataset and model registration. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports machine learning dataset wrappers and model classes, then generates dataset objects using controlled method calls. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The structure is standard for configuration or registration purposes in a machine learning pipeline. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware-like behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for defining datasets and models in a machine learning context. It appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks.",
