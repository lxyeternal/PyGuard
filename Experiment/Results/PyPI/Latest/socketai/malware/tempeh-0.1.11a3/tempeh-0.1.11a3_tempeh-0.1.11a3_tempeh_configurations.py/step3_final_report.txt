{
  "purpose": "This code defines datasets and models for machine learning workflows, importing classes and generating dataset classes via static methods, then organizing them into dictionaries for use in experiments or benchmarking.",
  "sources": "Static method calls for dataset generation, class references for models, and dictionary definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or network interactions are present; the code is purely static configuration.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static method calls and class references to dictionary assignments, with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script importing dataset and model classes, generating dataset classes via static methods, and organizing them into dictionaries. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward, with class references and static method calls, indicating benign intent. No suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The reasoning in each report correctly identifies the code as safe, with high confidence. Overall, the code appears to be a standard configuration for ML experiments, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script for datasets and models used in machine learning workflows. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
