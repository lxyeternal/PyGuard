{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to hold and generate datasets and models for machine learning workflows, primarily for benchmarking or experimentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'tempeh' library modules (datasets, models, constants) and generation of dataset classes via static methods.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially dangerous operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset generation functions (generate_dataset_class) into dataset dictionary; model classes are assigned directly to the models dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as obfuscated constructs, hidden code, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is straightforward, primarily data definitions and class references.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes and constants from the 'tempeh' package and generates dictionaries containing datasets and model classes. All dataset generation relies on static method calls that presumably produce dataset classes. No user input, environment variable usage, or network operations are present. The code appears to be standard setup code for ML experiments. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious activity. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and setup script for managing datasets and models in ML workflows, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
