{
  "purpose": "Defines datasets and models for automated enqueuing in a machine learning pipeline.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'tempeh' library, dataset generation calls, and class references for models.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, external network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and dataset/model generation are static; no data flow from untrusted sources or to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The dataset generation and model definitions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, creates datasets via class methods, and sets up model class references. There are no dynamic code executions, external inputs, or suspicious operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious intent. The code is structured for configuration purposes and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a configuration setup for datasets and models with no malicious behavior detected. It uses static imports and dataset/model definitions without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
