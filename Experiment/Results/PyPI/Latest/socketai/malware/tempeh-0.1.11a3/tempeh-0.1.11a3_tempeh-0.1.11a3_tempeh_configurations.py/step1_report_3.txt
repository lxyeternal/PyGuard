{
  "purpose": "This code defines datasets and models for machine learning experiments and enqueues them for automated processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tempeh.datasets', 'tempeh.models', and 'tempeh.constants'; dataset generation calls via 'generate_dataset_class' methods.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is written or transmitted. Dataset generation and model instantiation are internal.",
  "flows": "Imported dataset classes are used to generate dataset classes; models are assigned to wrapper classes. No external data flow or network transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. Dataset generation uses fixed parameters, which are standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports dataset and model wrapper classes, then creates dictionaries of datasets and models using class methods with predefined arguments. All operations are standard for setting up ML workflows. No external inputs, user data, or network activity are present. No suspicious code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for datasets and models used in machine learning pipelines. No malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a benign configuration script.",
