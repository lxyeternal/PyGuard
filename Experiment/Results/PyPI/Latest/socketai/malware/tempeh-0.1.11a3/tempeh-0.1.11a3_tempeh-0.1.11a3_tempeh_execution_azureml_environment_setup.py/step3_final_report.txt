  "purpose": "Configure an AzureML environment by loading requirements, optionally adding a private pip wheel, and enabling Docker.",
  "sources": "requirements.txt file, optional wheel_file, environment.add_private_pip_wheel() method, environment.python.conda_dependencies, environment.docker.enabled",
  "sinks": "add_private_pip_wheel() output, add_pip_package() calls, environment setup processes",
  "flows": "Reading requirements.txt -> adding private wheel (if provided) -> adding azureml-sdk -> enabling Docker",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward environment setup; no validation of private wheel integrity",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard environment configuration script for AzureML. It loads dependencies from a requirements file, optionally adds a private pip wheel, and enables Docker. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is the handling of the private wheel without validation, which could introduce malicious code if the wheel source is untrusted. The reports are empty, providing no additional insights. Scores should reflect minimal inherent risk but consider supply chain risks associated with unverified external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and performs expected environment setup tasks. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the private wheel file; without validation, it could pose a supply chain risk. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The overall malware score should be low if the sources are trusted, but potential risk exists if they are not. The environment setup itself is standard and secure.",
