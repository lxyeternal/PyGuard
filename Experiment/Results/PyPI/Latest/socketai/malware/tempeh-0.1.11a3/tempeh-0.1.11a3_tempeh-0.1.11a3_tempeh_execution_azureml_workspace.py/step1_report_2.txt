  "purpose": "Utilities for managing an Azure Machine Learning workspace, including resource group and workspace creation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: TENANT_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK methods that create or update resources, including resource group and workspace creation functions",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) are used to authenticate and identify resources, which then lead to resource and workspace creation (sinks)",
  "anomalies": "Code reads sensitive credentials from environment variables without additional encryption or obfuscation. No suspicious code obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets. No unusual control flow or misleading variable names. The code follows standard SDK procedures for resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves credentials and resource information from environment variables, which is common for cloud deployment scripts. It authenticates using service principal credentials, then ensures the existence of the resource group and workspace via Azure SDK calls. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The environment variables contain sensitive information but are handled through standard SDK authentication methods. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The logic and API usage are typical for Azure resource provisioning.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate Azure resource management utility for setting up ML workspaces. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signatures. The primary concern is the handling of environment variables containing sensitive data, but this is standard practice in cloud automation scripts.",
