  "sources": "Environment variables: TENANT_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is used directly in sensitive operations such as network requests or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Authentication and resource creation processes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses environment variables for credentials, which is standard practice; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code authenticates with Azure using environment-stored credentials, manages resource groups and workspaces. No evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. All operations are legitimate cloud resource management tasks. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility code for Azure ML workspace management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
