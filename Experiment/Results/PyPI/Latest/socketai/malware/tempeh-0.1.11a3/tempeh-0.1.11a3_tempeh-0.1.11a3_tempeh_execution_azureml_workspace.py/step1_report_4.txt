  "purpose": "Utilities for managing and provisioning Azure Machine Learning workspace resources, including resource groups and compute targets.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (TENANT_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION)",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK API calls that create or update resource groups and workspaces; logging outputs",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources; data flows into Azure SDK functions that perform resource management tasks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious API calls or unusual code patterns; standard Azure SDK usage; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves sensitive configuration data from environment variables, which is standard practice for secure credential management. It authenticates via a service principal, then ensures the existence of resource groups and an Azure ML workspace by calling Azure SDK functions. The logging is straightforward, providing status updates. The use of 'create_or_update' and 'exist_ok' flags indicates proper resource management. No malicious patterns, suspicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The code is structured and clear, focused on resource provisioning without any suspicious logic or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate Azure resource management tasks securely and transparently. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard implementation for Azure ML workspace setup using environment variables for credentials.",
