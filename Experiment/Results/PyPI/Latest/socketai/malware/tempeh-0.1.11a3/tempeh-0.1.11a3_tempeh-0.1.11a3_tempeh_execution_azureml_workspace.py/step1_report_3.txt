  "purpose": "Utility script for managing an Azure Machine Learning workspace, including resource group and compute provisioning.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: TENANT_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK functions that create or update resource groups and workspaces, which can modify cloud resources.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → authentication setup → resource group creation/update → workspace creation/update.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; sensitive info retrieved from environment variables. No obfuscated code or unusual logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses environment variables for credentials and resource identifiers, which is standard for cloud credentials management. It authenticates using ServicePrincipalAuthentication, then ensures resource groups and workspaces exist via Azure SDK calls. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The operations are typical for cloud resource provisioning. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or code injection. The code properly handles resource creation, with no unsafe or insecure code practices noted.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for Azure resource management. It uses standard SDK methods and environment variables for credentials, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
