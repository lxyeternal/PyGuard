  "sources": "Environment variables (TENANT_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION)",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK functions that create or update resource groups and workspaces, potentially affecting cloud resources based on environment variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Authentication object -> Resource group creation/update -> Workspace creation/access",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets retrieved from environment variables are standard practice, no suspicious dynamic code, or obfuscated patterns. Use of environment variables is typical, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves credentials from environment variables for authentication with Azure using Service Principal. It then ensures the specified resource group exists by creating or updating it, followed by creating or accessing the Azure ML workspace. All operations rely on Azure SDK functions with appropriate parameters. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the code does not perform any network communication outside Azure SDK calls, nor does it handle sensitive data insecurely. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for cloud resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs standard Azure resource provisioning tasks using environment-based credentials. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It follows best practices for cloud resource management without security concerns.",
