  "purpose": "Utility for managing Azure Machine Learning workspace, resource groups, and compute configurations using environment variables for credentials.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and resource identifiers; SDK functions for resource creation and management.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; standard SDK calls do not lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide credentials -> SDK functions authenticate and create resources -> No malicious or suspicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard SDK practices, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves credentials from environment variables, authenticates via Azure SDK, and manages resources with standard functions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The security risk stems from environment variable handling, which is common but should be managed securely. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, reflecting the code's legitimacy. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure resource management utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The handling of credentials via environment variables is standard practice, and the overall security risk is minimal. The provided reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
