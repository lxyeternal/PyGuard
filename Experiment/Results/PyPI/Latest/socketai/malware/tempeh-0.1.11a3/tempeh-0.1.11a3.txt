The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the private wheel file; without validation, it could pose a supply chain risk. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The overall malware score should be low if the sources are trusted, but potential risk exists if they are not. The environment setup itself is standard and secure."
