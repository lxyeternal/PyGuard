{
  "purpose": "Defines various constants and configuration parameters for a performance testing framework related to machine learning and datasets.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; all constants are statically defined within classes.",
  "targets": "No sinks for untrusted data or external interactions; the code only defines constants and configuration labels.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted input; the code only assigns static string and numeric values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is purely defining constants with no dynamic or obfuscated behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions containing static constants for use elsewhere in a machine learning performance testing framework. No input, no output, no data processing, no external calls, and no code execution or injection mechanisms are present. The structure is straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard Python class attributes for constant definitions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely definitional, and contains no malicious or security risks. It serves as a configuration or constants module without any dynamic or external operations.",
