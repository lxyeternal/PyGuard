  "purpose": "Defines constants for use in a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "Class variables and constant assignments within static classes.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static constants only, no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions containing string constants and numerical parameters. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data interactions, or executable code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The structure is clear, well-organized, and intended for configuration purposes. The absence of input/output, secrets, or code execution pathways indicates a benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured constants module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a benign classification, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
