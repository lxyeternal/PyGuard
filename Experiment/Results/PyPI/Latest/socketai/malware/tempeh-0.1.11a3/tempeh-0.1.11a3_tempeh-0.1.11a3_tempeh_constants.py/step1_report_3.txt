{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and configuration parameters for a performance testing framework related to machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; all data are static string or numeric constants defined within classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involve external input or untrusted sources; the code solely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code consists solely of class definitions and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured set of constant definitions for use across a performance testing framework, including data types, algorithms, tasks, datasets, and parameters. It contains no data input handling, no execution of untrusted code, and no network or system interaction. The code is static, well-organized, and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining constants for use in a larger framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and has no security issues.",
