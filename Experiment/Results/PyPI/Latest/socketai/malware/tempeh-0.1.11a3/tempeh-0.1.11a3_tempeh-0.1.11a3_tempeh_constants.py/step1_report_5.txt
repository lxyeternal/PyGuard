{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a performance testing framework, including dataset names, algorithms, metrics, and model parameters.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all constants are hardcoded within class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code does not handle external input or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class definitions containing static string and numerical constants. There are no functions, input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The code appears to serve as a configuration or constants module for a larger framework. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code’s structure and content are consistent with standard practice for defining constants.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward constants module with no indication of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and unlikely to be malicious.",
