  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as static class definitions containing constants for a machine learning performance testing framework.\n- No external data input, output, or dynamic behavior is mentioned.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity are identified.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines constants for a performance testing framework.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, purely constants.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code content. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, constants for a ML framework.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, static constants only.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, configuration constants.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Constants for ML performance testing.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Dataset names, algorithms, metrics, etc.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Purely static, no external handling.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and purely definitional.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0) are reasonable and consistent.\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n- Since the code is entirely static constants with no dynamic or external code, the **malware score** should remain at **0**.\n- The **obfuscated score** is correctly at **0**.\n- The **security risk** is appropriately at **0**.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores align with the analysis, confirming the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate in their analysis. The code is a straightforward constants module with no malicious or suspicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, well-structured, and suitable for its intended purpose without security concerns.",
