  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely static class definitions with constants, no dynamic behavior, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate, as there's no security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is benign, straightforward, and purely definitional.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; static constants, no external data or dynamic code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; static constants, no external interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous analyses.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static constants, no external data or dynamic code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, static constants with no external interactions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign, purely static, and configuration-oriented.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
