{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a performance testing framework in machine learning.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are referenced; all data are hardcoded constants within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths to external systems or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only declares static constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of class definitions and constants with no dynamic or executable code that could hide malicious intent. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured constants for data types, algorithms, tasks, metrics, dataset names, and configuration parameters for a machine learning performance framework. It contains no user input, network activity, or runtime data handling. The presence of hardcoded dataset names and configuration parameters is typical for such frameworks and poses no immediate security risk. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign collection of configuration constants used to standardize parameters within a performance testing framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
