{
  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "Constants defined within class attributes, no external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; all data is static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions containing static constant values used for configuration and parameter settings in ML testing. No external input handling, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code present. The code appears to be standard for a configuration module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward constants module used for a machine learning performance framework. It contains only static, well-documented constant definitions with no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities.",
