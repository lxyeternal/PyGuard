{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'tempeh' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file; importing the 'tempeh' module; accessing 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__'; no other data inputs.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function uses the imported 'tempeh' attributes and installs dependencies listed in 'install_requires'; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' -> uses 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__' for package info -> passes configuration to setuptools.setup() which installs dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'tempeh' module attributes for package name and version suggests dynamic data, but no malicious or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, importing a module named 'tempeh' to retrieve its name and version for packaging. No untrusted input sources, data leaks, or suspicious code flows are present. The dependencies listed are common for machine learning projects. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. The code adheres to typical setup scripts and does not perform any operations that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It simply reads a README file and configures package installation parameters using the 'tempeh' module attributes. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
