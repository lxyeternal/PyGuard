  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard Python package setup script.\n- Imports `setuptools` and a local module `tempeh`.\n- Reads `README.md` for long description.\n- Uses `tempeh.__name__` and `tempeh.__version__` for package metadata.\n- Calls `setuptools.setup()` with metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or input handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude the code is standard, with no anomalies, no malicious activity, and typical setup procedures. I agree with this assessment; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a typical setup script, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 1 with high confidence. This is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there's no security concern.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The use of `tempeh.__name__` and `tempeh.__version__` assumes these attributes exist and are safe. If the `tempeh` module is malicious or compromised, this could be a concern. However, based on the code alone, this is standard practice.\n- No external inputs or data flows that could lead to code injection or data leaks.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThe code is a conventional setup script with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, I agree with the assessments. No modifications to the scores are necessary. The code is safe, standard, and free from malicious behavior.",
