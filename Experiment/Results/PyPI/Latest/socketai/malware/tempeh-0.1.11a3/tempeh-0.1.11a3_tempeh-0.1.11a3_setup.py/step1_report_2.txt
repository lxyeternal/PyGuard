{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the packaging configuration for the 'tempeh' Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing the 'tempeh' module for version and name; package discovery via setuptools.find_packages(); specifying dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not execute or process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> setting up package metadata -> installing dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears to be a standard setup script without obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a local 'tempeh' module. It reads a markdown file for the description, then calls setuptools.setup() with metadata, dependencies, and package info. All actions are typical for package setup and do not involve dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
