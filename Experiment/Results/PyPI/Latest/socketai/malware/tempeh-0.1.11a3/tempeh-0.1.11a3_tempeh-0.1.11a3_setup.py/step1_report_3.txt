  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'tempeh' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads package version and name from the 'tempeh' module, reads README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup configuration is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Module imports 'tempeh' -> accesses its attributes -> reads README.md -> passes data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and a local module 'tempeh', then reads the README.md file for documentation. It uses 'setuptools.setup()' to configure package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. The use of 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__' assumes the 'tempeh' module is present and correctly defines these attributes. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical of Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
