{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'tempeh' with metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; imports 'tempeh' module to access name and version; no other data input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup()' to configure package installation; no untrusted data output or network transmission evident.",
  "flows": "Reads file -> accesses module attributes -> configures setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code appears standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for long description, imports the 'tempeh' module for package info, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with metadata and dependencies. No input validation issues, no network activity, and no code injection mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward and follows common setup practices. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
