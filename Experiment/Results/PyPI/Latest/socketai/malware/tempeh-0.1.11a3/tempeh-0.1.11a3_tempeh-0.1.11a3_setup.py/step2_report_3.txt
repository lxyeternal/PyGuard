  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the claims with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python setup script.\n- It imports 'setuptools' and a local module 'tempeh' to extract package name and version.\n- Reads 'README.md' for long description.\n- Calls 'setuptools.setup()' with metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No dynamic code execution, no input handling, no network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is standard and benign.\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly reads the package metadata and dependencies, and uses standard practices.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None detected.\n- **Security flaws:** None detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code does not process untrusted input or execute dynamic code.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 or very close to it; no security risks identified.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- Since the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n- The use of 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__' assumes the 'tempeh' module is trustworthy, but this is typical for package setup scripts.\n\n### Potential claims based on assumptions:\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities; all reports confirm the code's benign nature.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or malicious code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence, 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious or malicious activity.",
