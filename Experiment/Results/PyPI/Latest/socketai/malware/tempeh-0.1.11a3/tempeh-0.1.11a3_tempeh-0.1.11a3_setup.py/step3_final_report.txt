  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tempeh' Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; accesses 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity; no code execution from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata from 'tempeh' module; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script importing 'setuptools' and 'tempeh', reading a README file, and calling 'setuptools.setup()' with package info and dependencies. It does not execute dynamic code, handle untrusted input, or perform network operations. The use of 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__' is typical for package metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0, with high confidence, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are justified and appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
