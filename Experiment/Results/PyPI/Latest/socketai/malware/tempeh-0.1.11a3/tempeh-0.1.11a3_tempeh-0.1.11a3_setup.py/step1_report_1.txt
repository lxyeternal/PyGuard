{
  "purpose": "This code is configuring the setup for a Python package named 'tempeh' using setuptools, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, importing 'tempeh' for package metadata, and listing dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to untrusted code execution or external data leaks within this setup script.",
  "flows": "The package metadata (name, version) sourced from 'tempeh' module, dependencies listed in install_requires, and the README content are used to configure the package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are present. The script performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a local package 'tempeh' to extract metadata. It reads a README.md file for the long description. The setup() call specifies package details, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for Python package configuration. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; the code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution with specified metadata and dependencies.",
