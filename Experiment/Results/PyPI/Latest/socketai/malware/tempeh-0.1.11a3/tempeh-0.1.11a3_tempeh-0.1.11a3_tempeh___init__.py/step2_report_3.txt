  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with license comments.\n- No input, environment variables, external calls, or data processing are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is standard for Python package metadata.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a version string `'0.1.11a3'`, indicating an alpha release, which is common.\n- The scores assigned are all zeros for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk, which aligns with the code content.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which seems appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code is extremely minimal and standard; there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The reports correctly identify that no data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present.\n- Since the code is just a version declaration, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- None of the reports suggest any actual issues or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk should remain at 0.\n- The analysis and conclusions in each report are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The malware score should be 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The overall security risk score should be 0.\n- The confidence in these assessments is high, given the simplicity.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n- No changes needed in the reports.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious or security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No further action is necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0",
