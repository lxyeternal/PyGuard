  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists beyond the assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs; it is typical for a package's __init__.py or similar file.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a version variable assignment with a license comment. No input, environment variables, or untrusted data are involved. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The content is standard for a Python package's metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks in this code. It is a simple metadata declaration with no malicious intent.",
