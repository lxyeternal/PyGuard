{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string for a Python package, likely part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "The source is the assignment of the string '__version__' to the value '0.1.11a3'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as there are only static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns a version string to a variable, which is common in Python packages. It contains no logic, input/output operations, or external dependencies that could be exploited. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior is observable. The license comment and version string are standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves a typical purpose of defining package version information, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
