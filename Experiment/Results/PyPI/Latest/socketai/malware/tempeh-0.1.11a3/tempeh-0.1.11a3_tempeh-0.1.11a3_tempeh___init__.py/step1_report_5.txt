  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to be a metadata or header comment section that specifies licensing information and the version of the software.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the hardcoded string __version__ = '0.1.11a3'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, consisting solely of a license comment and a version variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a standard license notice and a version string assignment. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious functions, or suspicious data handling. The version string '0.1.11a3' indicates an alpha release, but this is common for development versions. No data input, external calls, or potentially dangerous constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple header and version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical in open-source projects to include such metadata. No issues detected.",
