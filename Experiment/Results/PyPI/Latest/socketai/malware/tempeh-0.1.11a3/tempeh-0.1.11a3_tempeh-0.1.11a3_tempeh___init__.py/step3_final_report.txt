{
  "purpose": "To declare the version of the package, serving as metadata for package management and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input, environment variables, or external data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is a simple static assignment with no data movement or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a license comment and a single assignment of '__version__' to a version string '0.1.11a3'. No input, external calls, or data processing occurs. The version string indicates an alpha release, which is typical. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or suspicious activity are evident or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
