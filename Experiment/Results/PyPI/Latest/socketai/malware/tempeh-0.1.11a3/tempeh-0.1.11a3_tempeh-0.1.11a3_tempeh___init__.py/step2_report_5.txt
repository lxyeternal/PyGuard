  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll five reports examine a very minimal code snippet: a license comment and a single assignment of the `__version__` variable to the string `'0.1.11a3'`. The consensus across all reports is that this code is benign, standard for package metadata, and contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious constructs.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n- **Data flows/input:** No input, environment variables, or external data involved.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a typical package metadata snippet, with no logic, input handling, or external communication.\n- The version string `'0.1.11a3'` indicates an alpha release, which is common in development stages and does not imply malicious intent.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and justified.\n\n### Any adjustments needed?\n- **Scores:** All scores are appropriate; no change necessary.\n- **Claims:** No claims are based on assumptions; all assessments are accurate.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are claimed or implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and standard nature of this code, my own estimates align with the reports:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest any malicious activity or security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, benign package metadata declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
