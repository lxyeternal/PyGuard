  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n- All reports identify the code as a simple variable assignment of a version string (`__version__ = \"0.1.11a3\"`) with accompanying license comments.\n- They uniformly conclude that there are no suspicious constructs, no data flows, no untrusted inputs, and no malicious behavior.\n- All scores assigned are zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or anomalies:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, standard, and contains only a version string assignment.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are present.\n   - No input, external calls, or data flows that could be exploited.\n\n2. **Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores:**\n   - Given the simplicity and standard nature, scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate.\n   - The high confidence score (1) is justified.\n\n3. **Logical flaws or reasoning errors:**\n   - No flaws or logical errors are evident; the reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign is correct.\n\n4. **Potential assumptions or claims:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions beyond the code snippet itself, which is appropriate.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are made that are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Score consistency:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.\n   - The scores reflect the actual risk level accurately.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The version string `0.1.11a3` indicates an alpha release, but this is standard and does not imply malicious intent.\n- The code is typical for package metadata and does not warrant any higher scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, with no security issues. I agree with the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward package metadata declaration with no security concerns.",
