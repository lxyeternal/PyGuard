  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\nAll five reports conclude that the code is benign, consisting solely of a version string assignment with no suspicious or malicious constructs. They assign a version string to `__version__`, include license comments, and do not involve any input, output, or external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains a version string assignment and license comments.\n- **Malicious activity:** No report finds any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Anomalies or suspicious constructs:** None identified.\n- **Data flows or sinks:** None, as the code is purely static metadata.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is minimal and standard for package metadata.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The version string `0.1.11a3` indicates an alpha release, which is typical and not suspicious.\n- No external dependencies, inputs, or outputs are involved.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly 0 in all reports.\n- **Malware:** Correctly 0 in all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** Correctly 0 in all reports.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since all reports agree and the code is straightforward, I concur with the given scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.** The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard version declaration with no suspicious features. There is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, and no further action is necessary.",
