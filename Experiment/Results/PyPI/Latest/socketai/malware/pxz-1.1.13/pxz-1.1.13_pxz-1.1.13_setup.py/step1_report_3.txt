  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a specified server.",
  "sources": "URL openers for 'https://api.ipify.org' and the server at 'http://35.170.187.220:8080/', os.uname(), os.path.expanduser('~'), os.getcwd(), datetime.now()",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to the server with collected system info",
  "flows": "Collect system info from network and system functions, encode and send via URL request to remote server during installation",
  "anomalies": "The function 'collect_system_info' is invoked during package installation without user consent, which can be considered malicious or at least intrusive. The IP address and system details are transmitted to an external IP without any user notification or opt-out mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a function to gather system info including public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It encodes this info and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote server during the package's installation process. The process occurs silently during installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious data collection without user awareness. The server address appears suspicious, and the behavior of transmitting system info automatically at install time is unusual and potentially malicious. No obfuscation or code concealment is present; the code is straightforward. It does not contain backdoors or malware like data exfiltration beyond system info, but the privacy invasion itself is suspicious and could be considered malicious behavior depending on intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package secretly collects and transmits system information during installation without user consent, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invading behavior. While technically not malware, the behavior is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
