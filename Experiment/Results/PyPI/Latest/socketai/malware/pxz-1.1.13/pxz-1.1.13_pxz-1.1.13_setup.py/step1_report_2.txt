{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system info such as public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and current time; reading network responses.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data -> encodes data -> constructs URL -> sends HTTP request to remote server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The function collects and transmits system information automatically during package installation without user consent. The server URL is hardcoded, and data is sent over an unencrypted HTTP connection. No user prompts or configuration options are provided.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'collect_system_info()' that retrieves various system details and sends them to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This occurs during the package installation process through a custom install command. It uses standard libraries for network communication and system info collection. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The primary concern is the automatic, unprompted transmission of potentially sensitive system data to an external server, which could be considered privacy invasion or malicious if used without user consent. The server address is hardcoded and transmits data over unsecured HTTP, which could be intercepted. However, there are no signs of malware like system damage, data exfiltration of specific user data beyond system info, or malicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "The package secretly collects and transmits system information during installation, which could infringe on user privacy and security. It does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors but raises privacy concerns due to automatic data exfiltration without user awareness. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or malware indicators.",
