{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (public IP, hostname, directories, timestamp) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded server during package installation, without user consent.",
  "sources": "urlopen('https://api.ipify.org'), os.uname().nodename, os.path.expanduser('~'), os.getcwd(), datetime.now()",
  "sinks": "urlopen(req, timeout=10) to the specified server URL",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data from sources and sends it directly to the server URL via HTTP GET request during installation",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data exfiltration during package install without user notification, hardcoded server IP, data sent over unencrypted HTTP, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward collection of system info and transmits it silently during setup, which is suspicious and privacy-invasive. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The data transmission over HTTP and the hardcoded server IP suggest potential misuse. The activity aligns with privacy violations or tracking rather than active malware. The scores assigned in reports vary, but given the behavior, malware and security risk scores should be high. The code's activity warrants caution but does not involve destructive actions or obfuscated malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior with automatic data exfiltration during installation. While it lacks malicious payloads, the activity is suspicious and potentially malicious, justifying high malware (~0.8) and security risk (~0.8) scores. The obfuscated score remains 0. The activity warrants caution due to privacy concerns and potential misuse in supply chain contexts.",
