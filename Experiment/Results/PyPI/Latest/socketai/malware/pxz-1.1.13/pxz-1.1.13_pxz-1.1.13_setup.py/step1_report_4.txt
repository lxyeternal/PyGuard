{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package that, upon installation, collects system information and sends it to a specified server.",
  "sources": "URL request to https://api.ipify.org for public IP, os.uname() for hostname, os.path.expanduser('~') for home directory, os.getcwd() for current directory, datetime.now() for timestamp, and the custom install command triggering data collection.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request to server at http://35.170.187.220:8080/ with encoded system information as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() gathers data from sources and constructs a URL with encoded parameters; then makes a network request to the specified server. The custom install command triggers this data collection during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects extensive system information and automatically sends it to an external server during installation without explicit user consent. The server IP (35.170.187.220) appears suspicious and is hardcoded; the process is initiated during setup, which is atypical for benign packages. No validation or encryption of data transmission is present.",
  "analysis": "The script includes standard setup procedures but introduces a side effect: data exfiltration during installation. It gathers publicly available info (IP address, hostname, directories, timestamp) and transmits it to a remote IP without user knowledge. The use of urllib for HTTP requests is straightforward. There are no signs of obfuscation or code concealment. The server IP appears malicious or at least suspicious, indicating potential privacy invasion or malicious tracking. The package itself seems benign in functionality but malicious in behavior due to automatic data exfiltration during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a malicious activity by collecting and sending system information to an external server during installation, which is not typical for legitimate packages. This behavior suggests intent to spy or exfiltrate user data without consent, representing a security concern.",
