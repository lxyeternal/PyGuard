  "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior with automatic data exfiltration during installation. While it lacks malicious payloads, the activity is suspicious and potentially malicious, justifying high malware (~0.8) and security risk (~0.8) scores. The obfuscated score remains 0. The activity warrants caution due to privacy concerns and potential misuse in supply chain contexts."
