{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a specified server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and current time. It also constructs a URL with these parameters and makes an HTTP request to a remote server.",
  "sinks": "The request to the remote server ('http://35.170.187.220:8080/') with system info parameters acts as a sink, transmitting potentially sensitive system data over the network.",
  "flows": "The system info is gathered in 'collect_system_info', URL-encoded, and then sent via an HTTP GET request during the custom install process. The flow is: data collection -> URL encoding -> network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed system information including public IP and hostname and transmits this data without any user consent or transparency. The server IP (35.170.187.220) is hardcoded, and the information is sent during installation, which is unusual behavior for a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard package installation process to include a function that collects sensitive system data. It constructs a URL with this data and makes a network request to a hardcoded IP address. This activity is performed automatically during installation, which is atypical for benign setup scripts. The data transmitted includes public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp. This behavior can be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. There are no obfuscated or malicious code constructs, but the intent to silently collect and transmit system info is suspicious and indicative of potential privacy violation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system information and transmitting it to a remote server during installation without user awareness or consent. This behavior suggests a privacy violation and potential malicious activity, such as user tracking or data exfiltration. The package should be considered suspicious.",
