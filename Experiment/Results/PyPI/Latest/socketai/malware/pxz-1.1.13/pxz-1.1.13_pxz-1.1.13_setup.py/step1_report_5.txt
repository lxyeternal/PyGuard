{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system info such as public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and current time; it also constructs and makes an HTTP request to a remote server with this data.",
  "sinks": "The network request to the remote server ('http://35.170.187.220:8080/') with system data; potentially the server could misuse this data or respond maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info variables is encoded into URL parameters, then sent via an HTTP GET request to the specified server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs unsolicited data transmission during package installation, which is unusual behavior for a package setup script; it uses a hardcoded server IP and sends system details without user consent or obvious purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the package installation process to execute 'collect_system_info', which gathers various system parameters and sends them to a hardcoded IP address. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking, especially since it occurs automatically during install. The code does not appear to perform malicious system modifications, but its purpose to collect and transmit data without user consent is suspicious. The network activity during package installation is unusual and potentially malicious in the context of supply chain security. The rest of the setup configuration appears standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. Overall, the code exhibits behavior consistent with potential tracking or data collection without user approval, which could be considered malicious or maliciously intended depending on user expectations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to gather and transmit system information during package installation to a specific server IP, which is suspicious and could be malicious or intrusive. While it does not perform destructive actions, its data collection behavior without explicit user consent raises security concerns.",
