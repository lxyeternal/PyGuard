  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and context.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network or file operations, code snippets, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, environment variable access, file writes, input handling.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to processing functions, possibly leading to network or file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either benign code or lack of code with appropriate caution. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are moderate to high based on available information. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The reasoning aligns with the data, and scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the limited context. All reports are consistent and justified; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
