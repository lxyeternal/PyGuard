  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility or library function, but the exact purpose cannot be determined without specific code content. It is likely intended for data processing or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or external files (if present). Exact sources are unclear due to missing code content.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network connections, or system commands. Specific sinks are not identifiable from the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (outputs, network, system calls). Details cannot be confirmed without code specifics.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or hard-coded secrets are visible due to lack of code content. No suspicious constructs or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient code provided to perform detailed analysis. The review is based on absence of specific code snippets; no malicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are observable in the given text.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of visible code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears benign, but this assessment is limited by missing implementation details.",
