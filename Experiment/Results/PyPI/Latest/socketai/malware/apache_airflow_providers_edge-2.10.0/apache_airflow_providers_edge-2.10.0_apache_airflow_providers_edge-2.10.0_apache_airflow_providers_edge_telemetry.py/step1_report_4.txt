  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, FQDN, platform info, and current UTC timestamp.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to a webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info gathered by _get_system_info() → passed to send_telemetry() → sent over network via requests.post()",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL which is an external endpoint; no credentials or secrets in code.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information and sends it to an external URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which may be a privacy concern but not malicious. The code performs standard system info gathering and network communication without obfuscation or suspicious behavior. No data leaks or malicious actions are evident. The network request is to a fixed URL, which could be used for tracking but is typical in telemetry. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a telemetry feature that reports system info to a fixed external endpoint. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The only potential concern is privacy due to data transmission to an external URL, but this is consistent with telemetry functionality.",
