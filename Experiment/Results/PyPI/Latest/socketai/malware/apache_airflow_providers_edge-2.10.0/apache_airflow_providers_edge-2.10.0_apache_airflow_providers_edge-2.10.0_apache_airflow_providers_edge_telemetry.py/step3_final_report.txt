{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, FQDN, platform, timestamp) and sends it via HTTP POST to a specified webhook URL for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.getfqdn(), platform.platform(), datetime.utcnow()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to external webhook URL with system info data",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources → data passed to send_telemetry() → requests.post() transmits data to webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of a publicly accessible webhook URL; no obfuscation; straightforward data collection and transmission",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and performs system info collection and external transmission without obfuscation or malicious payloads. The webhook URL is a public testing endpoint, which raises privacy concerns but not malicious intent. Error handling logs issues without leaking sensitive info. No hardcoded secrets besides the webhook URL, which is intended for testing. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign telemetry collection code with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary concern is privacy due to data transmission to an external, publicly accessible endpoint. The use of a test webhook URL suggests this is for testing or demonstration purposes, not production. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2 considering privacy implications.",
