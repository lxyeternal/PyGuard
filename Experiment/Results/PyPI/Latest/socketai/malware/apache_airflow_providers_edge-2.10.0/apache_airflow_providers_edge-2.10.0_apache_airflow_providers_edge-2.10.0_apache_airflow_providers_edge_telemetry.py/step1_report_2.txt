{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and send it to a specified webhook URL for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from socket functions (hostname, fqdn), platform module (platform info), datetime (current timestamp), and the data passed to send_telemetry method.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP POST request to the webhook URL using requests.post.",
  "flows": "collect_and_send calls _get_system_info to gather data, then send_telemetry transmits it over the network to the webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a default webhook URL that is publicly available (webhook.site), which might be intentional for testing but could leak data if misused. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, FQDN, platform info, and timestamp, then sends this information to a remote URL via an HTTP POST request. The URL is a placeholder on webhook.site, which is often used for testing and debugging. The code includes proper exception handling and logging but does not perform any malicious actions such as data theft, backdoors, or system damage. The functionality appears legitimate and aligned with telemetry collection. No suspicious or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign telemetry sender designed to report system information to a specified URL. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security exploits. Usage of a publicly accessible webhook URL may pose privacy considerations but does not constitute malicious activity.",
