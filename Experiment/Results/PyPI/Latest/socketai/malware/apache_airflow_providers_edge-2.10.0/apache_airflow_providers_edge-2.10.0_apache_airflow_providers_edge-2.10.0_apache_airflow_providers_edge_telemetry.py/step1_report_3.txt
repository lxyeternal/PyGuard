  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL for telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.getfqdn(), platform.platform(), datetime.utcnow().isoformat(), and the input webhook URL parameter.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() which sends data to the webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info gathered from source methods flows into the send_telemetry() method, which transmits data via HTTP POST to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends detailed system information to an external endpoint without validation or user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded with a specific endpoint, potentially for tracking. No explicit data sanitization or security checks are performed before sending data.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to collect system metadata such as hostname, FQDN, platform details, and timestamp. It then sends this data to a specified webhook URL via an HTTP POST request. The URL defaults to a fixed endpoint but can be overridden. No sensitive credentials are hardcoded. The telemetry data could potentially be used for tracking or fingerprinting the system. The implementation appears straightforward and intended for telemetry collection, with no evidence of malicious intent or backdoors. There are no obfuscated parts or malicious behaviors such as data theft, reverse shells, or system damage. The use of external requests is standard for telemetry but could be considered privacy-invasive depending on context. Overall, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior but does perform external data transmission that could be used for tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a telemetry collector sending system info to an external URL. It does not contain malicious actions such as data theft, system compromise, or backdoors. The main concern is potential privacy implications of sending system data without explicit user consent. No malware or malicious intent is evident.",
