  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious code.\n- Notes the use of `open(\"README.md\").read()` without exception handling, which is common but could cause errors if the file is missing.\n- Malware score: 0 — aligns with the conclusion that there's no malicious activity.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score: 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- Confidence: 0.9 — high, given the thorough reasoning.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the standard nature of the setup script.\n- Highlights the same potential issue with reading the README without error handling.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified.\n- Confidence: 1 — complete certainty based on the analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Again, confirms the script's standard nature.\n- No suspicious code or behavior identified.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusions; standard setup script.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis, noting the common pattern of reading 'README.md' without sanitization.\n- No malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The only minor concern is the lack of exception handling when reading 'README.md', but this is standard practice and not a security risk.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate. The risk scores are 0, consistent with the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Malware considerations:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The scripts are purely for packaging.\n- **Assumptions:** The reports do not rely on unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at 0, since no security risks are identified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or security issues.",
