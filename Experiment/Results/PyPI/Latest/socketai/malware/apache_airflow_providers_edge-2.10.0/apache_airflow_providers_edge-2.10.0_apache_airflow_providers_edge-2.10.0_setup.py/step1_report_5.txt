  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'apache-airflow-providers-edge' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "Potentially reading 'README.md' content which could contain malicious content if compromised.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' file -> including its content in package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without sanitization or error handling; standard setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. The 'long_description' is read from 'README.md' directly, which is common but could be a vector if the file is maliciously modified. No untrusted input handling, no suspicious code, no code injection, or malicious network activity is present. The script does not execute or download anything from external sources during setup.\nOverall, the code is standard, with no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script appears benign, with no malicious behavior detected. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious code or malicious payloads.",
