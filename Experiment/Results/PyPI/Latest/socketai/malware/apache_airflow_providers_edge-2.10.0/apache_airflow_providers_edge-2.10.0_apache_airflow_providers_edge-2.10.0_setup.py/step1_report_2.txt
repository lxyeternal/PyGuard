{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package called 'apache-airflow-providers-edge'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package information from the script itself, including package metadata, requirements, and the README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution; the code primarily handles package setup and metadata.",
  "flows": "The flow is from source definitions (package info, dependencies, README file) to setup function which processes this data to prepare the package.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() could potentially be risky if the README file is manipulated, but this is standard practice in setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and other info. No dynamic code execution, no external inputs beyond static files, and no network activity. The code appears to be a standard package setup script. The only potential concern is reading the README file, but this is typical in packaging workflows and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It securely specifies package metadata and dependencies, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
