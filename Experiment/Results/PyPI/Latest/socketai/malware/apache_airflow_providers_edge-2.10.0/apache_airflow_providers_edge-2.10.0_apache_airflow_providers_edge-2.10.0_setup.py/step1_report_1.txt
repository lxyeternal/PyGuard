  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'apache-airflow-providers-edge' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements from 'install_requires' and reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or output based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'install_requires' and 'long_description' flows into package metadata for setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without exception handling; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies. The only notable aspect is reading the 'README.md' file without error handling, which is common but could potentially cause issues if the file is missing. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project with no apparent malicious or security risks identified.",
