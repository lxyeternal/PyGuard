{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'apache-airflow-providers-edge'. It defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package description from 'README.md' and specifies dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; however, reading files like 'README.md' could potentially be exploited if the file contents are manipulated, but this is standard practice.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'README.md' for long description and uses 'find_packages()' to include packages, with dependencies specified for installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard setup script with no unusual or suspicious code. Author information is placeholder, but that alone is not malicious. No use of dynamic execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setuptools setup configuration. It reads a markdown file for long description, specifies dependencies, and sets metadata. No input sanitization or insecure code practices are present. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for packaging purposes only.",
