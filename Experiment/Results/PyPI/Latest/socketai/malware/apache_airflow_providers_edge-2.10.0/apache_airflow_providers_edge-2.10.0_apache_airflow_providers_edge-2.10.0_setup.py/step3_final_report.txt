{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python setup script used for packaging a Python project, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file content without exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected; no network or system modification code present.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependencies are configured for package installation; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; the only minor anomaly is the lack of error handling when reading 'README.md', which is typical in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script utilizing setuptools, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The reading of 'README.md' without error handling is standard but could cause errors if the file is missing, yet it does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dependencies are present. The code's purpose is solely to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, and the minor issue of missing exception handling does not impact security.",
