{
  "purpose": "Initialize and send telemetry data upon module import.",
  "sources": "Import statement for telemetry module, instantiation of Telemetry object, and method call collect_and_send()",
  "sinks": "collect_and_send() potentially sends data over the network or writes to external systems",
  "flows": "Import -> Telemetry instantiation -> collect_and_send() execution",
  "anomalies": "Automatic telemetry collection and sending at import time may be used for user tracking; no explicit user consent indicated",
  "analysis": "The code imports a telemetry module, creates a Telemetry object, and immediately calls a method to collect and send telemetry data. This behavior suggests that it gathers potentially user-related or system data and transmits it without explicit user interaction or configuration. Such behavior could raise privacy concerns and may be considered malicious if done without disclosure, although it depends on context and intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network connections are evident beyond the telemetry operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic telemetry collection and transmission during module import, which could be privacy-intrusive or malicious depending on context. No explicit malicious code or backdoors are present, but the behavior warrants caution due to potential privacy issues.",
