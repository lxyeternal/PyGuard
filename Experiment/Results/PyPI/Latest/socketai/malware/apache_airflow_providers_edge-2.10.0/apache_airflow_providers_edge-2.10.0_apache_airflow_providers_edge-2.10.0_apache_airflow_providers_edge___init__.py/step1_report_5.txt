{
  "purpose": "Initialize and send telemetry data when the module is imported",
  "sources": "Import of telemetry module, creation of Telemetry instance, calling collect_and_send() method",
  "sinks": "Potential data transmission via collect_and_send() (unspecified, but likely network communication)",
  "flows": "Import -> instantiate Telemetry -> call collect_and_send() -> data transmission",
  "anomalies": "Automatic telemetry collection and transmission at import time; no explicit user control or conditions, which could be considered unusual or privacy-invasive",
  "analysis": "The code imports a telemetry module and immediately creates an instance of Telemetry. It then calls the method collect_and_send() without any conditions, which suggests data is being collected and transmitted upon import. The version string is set but unrelated to telemetry. The lack of context about what data is collected or sent is a concern. This behavior could potentially transmit sensitive or user-related data without explicit user consent. No malicious code such as backdoors or malicious network activity is directly visible, but the telemetry behavior raises privacy concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic telemetry collection and sending at import time, which may infringe on user privacy if not properly disclosed or configured. It does not contain explicit malicious behavior but warrants caution due to its potential for data collection and transmission without user awareness.",
