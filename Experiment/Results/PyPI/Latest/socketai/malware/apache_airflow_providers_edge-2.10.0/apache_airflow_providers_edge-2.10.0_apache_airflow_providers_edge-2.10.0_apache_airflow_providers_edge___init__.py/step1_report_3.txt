  "purpose": "Initialize and send telemetry data upon module import.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Telemetry module; instantiation of Telemetry object; call to collect_and_send method.",
  "sinks": "The collect_and_send method likely transmits telemetry data over the network.",
  "flows": "Telemetry object is created from imported module -> collect_and_send is called -> data is sent externally.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic telemetry collection and sending during import may be considered suspicious if it sends data without user consent; no explicit handling or user notification shown.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class and immediately creates an instance, invoking collect_and_send(), which probably sends collected data externally. The presence of automatic telemetry upon import could be used for tracking or data collection without explicit user awareness. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are explicitly visible. However, the act of sending data at import time warrants scrutiny for privacy concerns or unexpected behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic telemetry collection and transmission upon module import, which could be a privacy concern or potentially malicious if data is sensitive or sent without user consent. There is no evidence of malicious code or backdoors, but the automatic data sending warrants caution.",
