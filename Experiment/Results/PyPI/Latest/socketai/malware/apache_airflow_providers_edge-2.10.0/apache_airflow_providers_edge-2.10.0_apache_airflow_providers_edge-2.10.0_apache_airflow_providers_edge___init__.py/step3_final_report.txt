  "purpose": "The code initializes telemetry collection and sends data immediately upon module import, likely for analytics or usage tracking.",
  "sources": "The instantiation of Telemetry() and the call to collect_and_send() during module load.",
  "sinks": "Potential network transmission of telemetry data, possibly sending data over the internet.",
  "flows": "Telemetry object creation (source) -> collect_and_send() method (sink) which transmits data.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data collection and transmission during import without user consent or configuration, which can be privacy-intrusive.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class, creates an instance, and calls collect_and_send() immediately, indicating automatic telemetry transmission. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are visible. The main concern is privacy, as data is sent without explicit user control. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the straightforward implementation. Security risk scores vary from 0.2 to 0.6 across reports, reflecting privacy implications rather than malicious activity. Given the behavior, a moderate security risk score (~0.4) is appropriate, acknowledging privacy concerns but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic telemetry collection and transmission at import, raising privacy concerns but not exhibiting malicious behavior. Scores are consistent with this assessment; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the security risk should be set around 0.4 to reflect privacy implications.",
