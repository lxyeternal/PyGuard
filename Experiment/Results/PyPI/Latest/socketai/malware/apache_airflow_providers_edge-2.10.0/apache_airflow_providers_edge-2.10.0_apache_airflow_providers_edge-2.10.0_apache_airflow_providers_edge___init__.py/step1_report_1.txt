  "anomalies": "Code automatically sends telemetry data upon import without user consent or explicit control",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class from a local module, then immediately creates an instance and calls a method to collect and send telemetry data. This behavior may be used for usage tracking or analytics, but without user consent it could be considered intrusive. No sensitive data, hardcoded credentials, or malicious actions are explicitly present. The version string indicates a release version. Overall, the code is straightforward and focused on telemetry, with no evident malicious intent but raises privacy concerns due to automatic data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic telemetry collection and transmission during module import. While this is common for analytics, it could be considered intrusive if done without user consent. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is detected, but the privacy implications warrant caution.",
