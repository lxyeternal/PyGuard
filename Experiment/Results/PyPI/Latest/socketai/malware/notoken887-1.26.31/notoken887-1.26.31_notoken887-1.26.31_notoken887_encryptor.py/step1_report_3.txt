{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide a simple obfuscation and de-obfuscation mechanism for tokens, likely for protecting sensitive data or credentials within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network via requests.get to download an executable file and writes it to the user's Documents directory. It also reads local files (info.txt). It initiates an executable via os.startfile.",
  "sinks": "The code executes an external file (sm.exe) using os.startfile, which can run arbitrary code. It also writes downloaded content directly to a local file, potentially executing malicious payloads. The decrypt method calls pt() which executes the downloaded file.",
  "flows": "The download of the executable (https://thugging.org/files/sm.exe) flows from the network request to local storage, then to execution via os.startfile. The decrypt method triggers pt(), which causes the executable to run, possibly affecting the system. The token decryption relies on this side effect.",
  "anomalies": "The pt() function automatically executes a downloaded executable file without any user interaction. The code downloads and executes an external executable from a suspicious URL, which strongly suggests malicious intent. The decryption method calls pt(), leading to potential malicious code execution every time decryption is performed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports requests and os modules. The function pt() uses os.startfile to run an executable located in the user's Documents folder, which it downloads from a suspicious URL. It writes the executable content to 'sm.exe' without validation. The class TokenCryptor provides obfuscation and de-obfuscation for tokens by replacing characters with emojis and vice versa. During decryption, it calls pt(), which results in executing a downloaded malicious executable. The code's core malicious behavior is the automatic download and execution of a remote executable during the decryption process, which can lead to system compromise. The obfuscation methods are harmless in themselves but are used here in conjunction with malicious behavior to hide activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it automatically downloads and executes a remote executable during token decryption, representing a significant security risk. The obfuscation functions are secondary and used to disguise token data. Overall, the package exhibits high malicious intent, with a high likelihood of executing harmful payloads upon use.",
