  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'notoken887' including package discovery, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, find_packages() for package discovery, input parameters for setup()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Input parameters to setup() define package configuration; entry point specifies the command-line script location",
  "anomalies": "Author email uses 'hitler@gmail.com', which is suspicious; the description mentions 'obfuscation test lib' but no actual obfuscation code or techniques are present; URL points to a questionable domain 'https://thugging.org'",
  "analysis": "The setup script performs standard package configuration with no code execution, data processing, or dynamic behavior. The use of find_packages() is typical. The author email is a red flag and may suggest malicious intent or at least unprofessional conduct. The URL is suspicious, possibly malicious or deceptive. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present. The mention of 'obfuscation test lib' may imply intent to obfuscate or hide code, but no such code exists here. Overall, the code itself is benign but points to potentially malicious or untrustworthy context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with suspicious metadata (author email and URL). No malicious code or behavior detected within this snippet, but the surrounding context and metadata raise concerns about the package's trustworthiness.",
