  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'notoken887', including metadata and entry points for installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including package metadata, author info, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply provides package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Author email is set to 'hitler@gmail.com', which is suspicious and unprofessional. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, using setuptools. It does not contain any code execution, data processing, or external communications. The only notable concern is the author email address, which is inappropriate and unprofessional, but does not indicate malicious code. No source-to-sink data flows or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with a questionable email address but no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be obfuscated or malicious only due to inappropriate metadata, not code behavior.",
