  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as author email, URL, description, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org'), unprofessional and provocative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior. The only notable anomalies are metadata concerns, which do not constitute malware or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code and focus on metadata suspicion. Malware score is appropriately 0; obfuscation score is 0; security risk score is moderate (~0.3-0.4) due to unprofessional metadata. The code itself is safe, but metadata should be corrected to improve trustworthiness.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard, with suspicious metadata that warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware and obfuscation scores are accurate; the security risk score should reflect metadata concerns.",
