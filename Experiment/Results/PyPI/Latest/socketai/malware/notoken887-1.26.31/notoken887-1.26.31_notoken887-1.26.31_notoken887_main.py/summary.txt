  "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but employs a risky pattern of encrypting, decrypting, and executing code dynamically, which can be exploited if misused. The current scores in reports are generally appropriate; however, the malware score should be kept low given the absence of malicious payloads, while the security risk remains high due to dynamic execution. Overall, the code's design facilitates obfuscation and runtime code execution, posing significant security concerns if inputs are compromised."
