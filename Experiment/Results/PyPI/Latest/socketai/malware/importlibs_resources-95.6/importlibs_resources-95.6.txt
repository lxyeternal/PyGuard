      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The risk is significant due to the possibility of executing untrusted code at install time. Scores should reflect a high probability of malicious behavior and security risk, with malware score increased accordingly."

      "conclusion": "The script is primarily a data exfiltration tool collecting system info and sending it to suspicious external URLs. It does not contain active malware or malicious payloads but poses significant privacy and security risks due to covert data collection and exfiltration. The current scores are reasonable, though the malware score could be slightly lowered to reflect the absence of payloads. Overall, the activity warrants caution, and the high risk score is justified."
