  "purpose": "Collects system hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and exfiltrates this data via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system info, and the URL parameters with encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls with constructed URLs containing system info and encoded MAC addresses.",
  "flows": "Data from system info functions flows into URL parameters, which are sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling, use of suspicious external URLs, minimal obfuscation (base64 encoding), no user notification or consent, and collection of potentially sensitive system info.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data collection of hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to multiple suspicious external URLs via HTTP GET requests. No malicious payloads, code injection, or destructive actions are present. The silent exception handling could hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. The URLs are obfuscated and suspicious, suggesting potential privacy invasion or reconnaissance activity. The behavior aligns with data exfiltration or tracking rather than active malware. The minimal obfuscation (base64) and lack of malicious payloads suggest low to moderate malicious potential, primarily privacy concerns. The scores assigned in the reports generally reflect this, with malware scores around 0.2–0.4, obfuscation around 0.2, and risk scores around 0.6–0.75. Given the behavior, a malware score of approximately 0.3–0.4 is appropriate, with a risk score of about 0.7, considering the suspicious external communication and privacy implications.",
  "conclusion": "The script is primarily a data exfiltration tool collecting system info and sending it to suspicious external URLs. It does not contain active malware or malicious payloads but poses significant privacy and security risks due to covert data collection and exfiltration. The current scores are reasonable, though the malware score could be slightly lowered to reflect the absence of payloads. Overall, the activity warrants caution, and the high risk score is justified.",
