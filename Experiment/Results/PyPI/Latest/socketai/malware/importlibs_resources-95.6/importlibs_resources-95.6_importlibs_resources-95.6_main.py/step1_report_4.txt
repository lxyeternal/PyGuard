{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to specific remote URLs with parameters encoded in the URL query string.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which reads system network interfaces), and random.randint() for generating a random number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sends data to external URLs, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, random number) are gathered, encoded, and appended as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs contacted are suspicious and obscure; MAC addresses are base64-encoded and sent to external domains. No explicit user input is involved, but the code actively transmits system info to third-party servers. No obvious malicious code execution, but the pattern of data exfiltration is concerning.",
  "analysis": "The code collects identifiable system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded with base64 before being sent. It contacts three external URLs, which appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate services. The data is sent via HTTP GET requests with parameters including encoded MAC addresses. The code's behavior suggests potential data exfiltration or surveillance, especially considering the obscured URLs and base64 encoding. No malware or backdoors are explicitly present, but the activity resembles covert data collection. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly collects system information and transmits it to suspicious external servers, which may indicate malicious data exfiltration or surveillance behavior. There is no evidence of destructive actions or backdoors, but the activity pattern is concerning and warrants caution.",
