{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reading system information: platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests to external URLs with embedded parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is collected and encoded; then included as URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Code encodes MAC addresses in base64, potentially to obfuscate data. The URLs used are suspicious and obfuscated, pointing to potentially malicious domains. The data exfiltration occurs without user consent, with no indication of user notification. Exception handling is silent, which may hide issues. No direct data storage or user interaction.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers detailed system info, including MAC addresses, and transmits this data silently to multiple external URLs. The URLs are suspicious, potentially malicious domains designed for data collection or command-and-control communication. The code does not perform any obvious malicious actions like file manipulation, privilege escalation, or malware installation, but the data exfiltration to unknown external servers constitutes a security concern. The base64 encoding of MAC addresses seems to serve as obfuscation, possibly to evade simple detection. No explicit malicious behavior such as code execution, backdoors, or payloads is present, but the data exfiltration without consent is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a system information gatherer and exfiltrator to suspicious external domains, with obfuscation and silent exception handling. While it does not contain clear malware or malicious payloads, its behavior is suspicious due to data collection and transmission to unknown servers, indicating potential malicious intent or compromise.",
