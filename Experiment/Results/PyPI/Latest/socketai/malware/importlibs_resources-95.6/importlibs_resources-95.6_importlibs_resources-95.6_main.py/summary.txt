  "conclusion": "The script is primarily a data exfiltration tool collecting system info and sending it to suspicious external URLs. It does not contain active malware or malicious payloads but poses significant privacy and security risks due to covert data collection and exfiltration. The current scores are reasonable, though the malware score could be slightly lowered to reflect the absence of payloads. Overall, the activity warrants caution, and the high risk score is justified."
