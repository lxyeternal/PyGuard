{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in Base64.",
  "sources": "Input sources include platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and get_mac_addresses() which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs constructed with URL parameters including encoded MAC addresses and other system info.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from platform and OS calls, is encoded in Base64, incorporated into URL parameters, and sent over network requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain patterns, concatenation of encoded MAC addresses, and URL requests to potentially malicious domains. No explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected, but the code’s behavior suggests data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and encodes MAC addresses in Base64. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends the collected data as URL parameters via HTTP GET requests. The domains used are non-standard, potentially malicious, and resemble command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoints. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads like reverse shells are present. The purpose appears to be stealthy collection and transmission of device identifiers, possibly for fingerprinting or unauthorized tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect system information and exfiltrate it to external servers, which may be malicious or used for tracking. While it doesn't contain explicit backdoors or payloads, its behavior and target domains suggest a high risk of privacy invasion or malicious data collection. It warrants caution and further investigation before use.",
