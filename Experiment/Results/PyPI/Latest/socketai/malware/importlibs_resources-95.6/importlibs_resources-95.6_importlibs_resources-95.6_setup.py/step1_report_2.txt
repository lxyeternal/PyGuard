  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that executes a custom install step calling main() from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the CrazyInstallStrat class, which imports and executes main() from main.py.",
  "sinks": "Calling main() from main.py, which could potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method triggers 'main()' in main.py, executing its contents.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class immediately executes main() from main.py during installation, which is unusual and potentially risky.",
  "analysis": "The setup script customizes the installation process by defining a subclass of setuptools.command.install. The run() method calls the original install.run(self) and then imports and executes main() from main.py. This behavior triggers arbitrary code execution during package installation. The code does not specify what main() does, but executing code from main.py at install time is suspicious, as it could run malicious or unintended commands. The package requirements are benign ('requests', 'psutil'), but the automatic invocation of main() is a potential security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes main() from main.py during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious depending on the contents of main.py. This could allow arbitrary code execution at install time, posing a security risk. Further review of main.py is recommended.",
