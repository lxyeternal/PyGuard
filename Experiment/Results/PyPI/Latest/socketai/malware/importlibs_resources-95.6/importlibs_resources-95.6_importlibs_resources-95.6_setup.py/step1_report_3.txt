{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom install command that executes a function from the main module after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (setuptools, a custom class, and the main module's main function) and reads package metadata from variables and arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code calls main() from the main module after installation, which could potentially execute arbitrary code if main() is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom CrazyInstallStrat class runs the standard install process, then imports and executes main() from the main module.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code from the main module during installation, which is unusual for setup scripts. No explicit hard-coded credentials or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines package metadata and a custom install command. The custom class CrazyInstallStrat overrides the run() method to perform the standard installation and then import and execute main() from main.py. This pattern is atypical, as executing arbitrary code during setup can be malicious if main() is compromised. The package requires 'requests' and 'psutil' libraries, which are common. No evidence of code obfuscation or malicious intent within this snippet alone, but the execution of main() at install time is suspicious and could be exploited if main() contains malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains an unusual pattern of executing code from the main module during installation. While this could be legitimate, it presents a significant security risk if main() is malicious. The code itself appears straightforward and does not contain embedded malware or obfuscation, but the execution pattern warrants caution.",
