  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The risk is significant due to the possibility of executing untrusted code at install time. Scores should reflect a high probability of malicious behavior and security risk, with malware score increased accordingly."
