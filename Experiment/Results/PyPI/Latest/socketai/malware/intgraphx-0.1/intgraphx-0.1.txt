      "conclusion": "The code appears benign in most cases, with the exception of Report 5's obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, which suggest moderate suspicion. Slightly elevating Report 3's malware and risk scores improves alignment with observed patterns. Overall, the scoring is appropriate and justified based on the evidence."
