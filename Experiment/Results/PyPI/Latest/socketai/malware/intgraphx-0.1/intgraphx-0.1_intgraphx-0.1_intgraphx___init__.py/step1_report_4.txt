  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task within a larger application, but the exact intent cannot be determined from the provided snippet alone.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or APIs, depending on the full implementation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file operations, or execution of system commands if present, though specifics are not provided in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or function inputs to sinks like network calls or system operations, but detailed flow analysis is limited due to lack of full code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are identified within the visible code. No malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is minimal and does not contain any clear security risks or malicious behavior. It does not show hardcoded secrets, unsafe code practices, or suspicious activity. The structure is straightforward and typical of benign Python scripts. Lack of more detailed code prevents thorough source-to-sink flow analysis, but based on what is available, no malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.",
