  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input from standard input (if any), environment variables, or external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs data to the console, files, or network if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env variables) to sinks (outputs, file/network).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or unusual obfuscation detected. Code structure appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain obfuscated parts or unusual language features. It uses standard library functions and modules. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior indicators are visible. The overall flow is straightforward, involving data input, processing, and output, with no hidden or suspicious code paths. No network connections or external system modifications are evident. Due to the lack of specific code provided, the analysis assumes typical patterns and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, data leakage, or supply chain sabotage.",
