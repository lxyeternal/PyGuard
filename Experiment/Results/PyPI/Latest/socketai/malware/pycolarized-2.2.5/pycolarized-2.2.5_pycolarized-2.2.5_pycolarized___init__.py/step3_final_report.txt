  "purpose": "Module for terminal styling and color management, importing initialization, ANSI color codes, and platform-specific handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.initialise, .ansi, .ansitowin32) and version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "Imports and version string setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and version declaration with standard license comment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initializer importing styling functions and classes, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. It is typical for a terminal styling library, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or external interactions are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for terminal styling, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
