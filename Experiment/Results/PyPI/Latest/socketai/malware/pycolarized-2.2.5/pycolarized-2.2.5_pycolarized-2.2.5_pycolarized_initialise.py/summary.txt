  "conclusion": "The presence of a heavily obfuscated, runtime-decoded, and executed payload indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code appears legitimate but is overshadowed by this malicious payload. The high malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are justified. The package should be considered compromised or malicious until further analysis confirms otherwise."
