{
  "purpose": "This code provides Windows-specific console handling utilities, including functions to get and set console attributes, cursor position, title, and console mode.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'ctypes' and 'ctypes.wintypes', which are standard Python modules for calling Windows API functions.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Windows API functions such as SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, and SetConsoleMode. These functions manipulate console properties but do not directly handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No untrusted input sources are processed; the functions interact solely with Windows API handles and system calls to control console behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears to be a standard implementation of Windows console API wrappers, with proper error handling and fallbacks for non-Windows environments.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes Windows console API functions using ctypes, defines structures for console info, and provides utility functions to manipulate console output. It includes environment checks for Windows, with fallback lambdas for non-Windows systems, preventing exceptions. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or obfuscated code are present. The functions are limited to console UI management without any data leaks, remote communication, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of Windows console handling utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for system interaction via Windows API calls without processing untrusted data or performing harmful operations.",
