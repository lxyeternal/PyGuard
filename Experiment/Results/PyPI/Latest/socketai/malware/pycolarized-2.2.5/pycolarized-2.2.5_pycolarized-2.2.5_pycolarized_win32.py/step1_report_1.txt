{
  "purpose": "Provides Windows console handling functions such as changing text attributes, cursor position, screen buffer info, and console title.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'ctypes', uses Windows API functions via 'windll.kernel32' to get and set console information and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Windows API functions that modify console state, such as 'SetConsoleTextAttribute', 'SetConsoleCursorPosition', 'SetConsoleTitleW', and others, which could potentially be misused if called with malicious parameters.",
  "flows": "Uses imported functions to retrieve handle info, then manipulates console attributes or position based on input parameters. No external or untrusted input handling is evident, and the flow appears limited to console management.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code is mostly wrapper functions around Windows API calls with some position adjustments. No obfuscated or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily acts as an interface to Windows console API functions, enabling manipulation of console attributes, cursor, buffer info, and title. It conditionally imports and defines functions based on platform capabilities, but does not include any network operations, file manipulations, or external data handling that could be malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration methods are evident. The code appears to be a standard utility module for console manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Windows console utility module. It provides functions for console management without any indication of malicious intent or suspicious activity. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
