{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for interacting with the Windows console, such as setting text attributes, cursor position, title, and buffer info.",
  "sources": "Imports from ctypes and ctypes.WinDLL, and Windows API functions like GetStdHandle, GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, etc.",
  "sinks": "Functions that call Windows API to modify console state and retrieve console buffer info, potentially affecting the console environment.",
  "flows": "Imports from user environment -> API functions retrieve/modify console settings -> functions return or modify console state based on inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code primarily wraps Windows API calls for console management.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes and wraps Windows console API functions, allowing for manipulation of console attributes such as text color, cursor position, and title. It uses standard ctypes approach for DLL access. No suspicious code or behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms, is present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for console control on Windows systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Windows console API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It serves legitimate purposes and does not contain malware or suspicious behavior.",
