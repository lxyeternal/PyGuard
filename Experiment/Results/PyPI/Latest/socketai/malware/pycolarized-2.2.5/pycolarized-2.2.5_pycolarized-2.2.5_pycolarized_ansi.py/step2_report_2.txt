  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward utility module for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling and cursor control.\n- It defines constants, functions, and classes with static values.\n- No external input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The code does not contain any obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports uniformly conclude the code is benign with minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. All reports indicate no issues, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears well-structured, standard, and safe.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None. The code does not perform any risky operations; thus, high scores are unwarranted.\n\n- **Malware score reflection?**  \n  Correctly set to 0 across all reports, matching the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports rely on factual analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n- **Score consistency?**  \n  Yes. The scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is a standard ANSI escape sequence generator for terminal styling.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, obfuscation, or supply chain risks.\n- The reports' summaries and scores align well with the code's actual behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (benign utility with no external data handling)\n\nThe code is a safe, well-understood utility module for terminal styling. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.",
