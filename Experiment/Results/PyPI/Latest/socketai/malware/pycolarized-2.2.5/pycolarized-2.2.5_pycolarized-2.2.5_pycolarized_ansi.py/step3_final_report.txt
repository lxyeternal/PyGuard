{
  "purpose": "This code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, including colors, styles, and cursor control.",
  "sources": "No external input, data processing, or dynamic code execution; static constants and functions constructing escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The functions return static or parameterized escape sequences; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward implementation of terminal styling utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for ANSI escape sequences, with no external data handling or dynamic execution. It is a standard utility module for terminal styling, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. All functions and classes serve static purposes, and no external input influences their behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for generating ANSI escape sequences. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
