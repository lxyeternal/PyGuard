{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text coloring, styling, and cursor positioning.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions that generate escape sequences; class attributes defining color codes; methods that format these codes into strings.",
  "sinks": "Functions returning escape sequences are used to control terminal output but do not process untrusted input; no external sinks or data transmission points observed.",
  "flows": "Static constants and methods produce escape sequences directly; no dynamic or untrusted data sources feed into these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution; classes and functions are straightforward and serve formatting purposes. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and methods for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It initializes classes with color codes and provides methods for cursor movement and screen clearing. All data is statically defined; no input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. The code appears to be a standard utility module with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for terminal styling and cursor control, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted input or perform any network or system modifications. Overall security risk is minimal.",
