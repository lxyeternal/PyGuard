{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, including colors and cursor positioning.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading points are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output is involved; functions return escape sequences as strings.",
  "flows": "The code constructs ANSI escape sequences via string concatenation; no external data flow or dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected. The class attribute initialization is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or code injection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for ANSI escape sequences used for terminal text styling and cursor control. It includes functions to generate escape sequences, classes to hold style codes, and cursor positioning commands. No user input handling, external data reading, or unsafe operations are present. The code appears to be a standard utility module for terminal styling, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal output. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
