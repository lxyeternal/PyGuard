{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "The code defines constants and functions that generate ANSI escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "The functions return strings containing escape sequences that can influence terminal display; no untrusted input handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Functions convert input parameters into ANSI escape sequences; no external data flows are present or processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code primarily defines constants and straightforward functions. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. It includes predefined color, style, and cursor movement codes. The implementation is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard terminal formatting helper library with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign terminal formatting utility library with no indication of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It only defines functions and constants for generating ANSI escape sequences without processing untrusted data or performing any insecure operations.",
