{
  "purpose": "The code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal coloring and cursor control, intended for formatting terminal output.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading points; all data is hardcoded constants or internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no output or data leakage functions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions return static escape sequences or formatted strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard ANSI escape sequences and well-defined class structures without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script defines constants for ANSI terminal control sequences, along with classes to generate color, style, and cursor movement codes. The class 'AnsiCodes' dynamically wraps class attribute values into escape sequences during instantiation, which is a standard design pattern for such utilities. No external input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module for terminal formatting with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for generating ANSI escape sequences used for terminal text formatting. It contains no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It operates solely on predefined constants and internally generated sequences without external data interaction.",
