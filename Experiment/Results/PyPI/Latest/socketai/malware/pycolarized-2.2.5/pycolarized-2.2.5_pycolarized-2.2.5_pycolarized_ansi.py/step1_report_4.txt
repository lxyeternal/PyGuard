{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text coloring, styling, and cursor movement.",
  "sources": "The code defines constants and functions for generating ANSI escape sequences based on input parameters. It also initializes objects representing colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs strings with ANSI escape sequences but does not execute them directly or send them to external processes or network. No untrusted data handling or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The functions create escape sequence strings based on provided parameters, which can be used by external code to control terminal output. There are no direct source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of ANSI escape sequence generation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, functions, and classes for generating ANSI escape sequences to control terminal text color, style, and cursor position. It uses standard methods of string concatenation and attribute handling. The AnsiCodes class dynamically wraps class attribute values with escape sequences upon instantiation, which is standard. No external input handling, network communication, or file operations are present. The code’s purpose is solely to generate terminal control sequences, with no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for terminal styling and cursor control using ANSI escape sequences. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No suspicious activity or anomalies are detected.",
