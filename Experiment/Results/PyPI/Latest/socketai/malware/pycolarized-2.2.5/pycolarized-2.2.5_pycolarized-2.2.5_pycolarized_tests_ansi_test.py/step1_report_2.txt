  "purpose": "Unit testing of ANSI escape code attributes and ANSI to Win32 conversion functionality in a Python module.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, unittest components, and local module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; code primarily performs assertions and attribute checks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities; tests verify constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code solely performs static assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system and testing modules, sets up test cases to verify ANSI color and style codes. No user input handling, data processing, or external communication present. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is straightforward unit tests verifying predefined constants. The import paths suggest it is part of a larger library but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns or anomalies observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite verifying ANSI escape code constants within a Python package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely as a unit test module for code correctness.",
