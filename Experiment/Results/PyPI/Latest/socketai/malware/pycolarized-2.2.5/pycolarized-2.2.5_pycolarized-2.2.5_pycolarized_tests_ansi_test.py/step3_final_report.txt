  "purpose": "Static verification of ANSI escape code constants for terminal styling, ensuring correctness of foreground, background, and style attributes.",
  "sources": "Internal modules providing ANSI constants (..ansi), console stream management (..ansitowin32), and standard input/output streams (sys.stdout, sys.stderr).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only performs static assertions and stream management without external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code does not process untrusted data or execute dynamic flows; it only verifies static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with static assertions and standard setup/teardown procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying that ANSI escape sequence constants match expected values. It imports internal modules for ANSI styling, manages stdout/stderr streams to prevent wrapping, and asserts the correctness of color and style codes. No user input, external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is static, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static test suite verifying ANSI escape code constants with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
