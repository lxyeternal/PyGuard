  "purpose": "Unit tests for ANSI escape code constants in the color and style modules of a terminal styling library.",
  "sources": "Imports from parent modules (`..ansi`, `..ansitowin32`) and standard library (`sys`, `unittest`).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data output present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; tests only verify constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation; the code is straightforward test definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite verifying that certain color and style constants match expected ANSI escape sequences. It uses the `unittest` framework to perform assertions on the imported constants. There is no data input, external communication, or dynamic execution involved. The imported modules are part of the package and are not suspicious. The code does not perform any file, network, or system modifications. It strictly checks static string values for correctness.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for verifying ANSI escape code constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It functions solely as a validation tool for package constants.",
