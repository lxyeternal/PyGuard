{
  "purpose": "Unit testing module for ANSI escape sequence constants and console output handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, unittest, and internal modules 'ansi' and 'ansitowin32'. No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external output; the code only verifies constant values and resets stdout/stderr.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; tests are isolated and do not process external or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and only tests constant values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and internal modules for ANSI color constants and console handling. It sets up tests to verify the correctness of color and style constants, and manages stdout/stderr streams during setup and teardown. There is no dynamic code execution, no data handling from external sources, and no interaction with potentially malicious components. It is a standard unit test suite with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, safe unit testing script for verifying ANSI escape sequence constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
