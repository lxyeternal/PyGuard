  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code is a static comment with no input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only a comment block with no executable or data transfer paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward license comment with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a license comment with no executable content, data input/output, or data flow. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the content. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks. The code's nature is benign, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license comment with no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The existing reports and scores are accurate and justified.",
