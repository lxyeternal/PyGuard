  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ANSI escape sequence handler and stream wrapper for terminal compatibility. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.0, risk: ~0.1-0.2) are accurate and justified given the functionality and potential for misuse with malicious input, which is a known risk in such utilities but not indicative of malicious intent."
