{
  "purpose": "The code fetches remote data from a specified URL during installation, writes it to a hidden file, and appends a command to user shell configuration files to execute this script, potentially enabling persistent malicious activity.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen to fetch remote content; open() to write to ~/.fleetwood.py; open() to append to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via shell configuration files; potential remote code execution",
  "flows": "Remote URL -> local file ~/.fleetwood.py -> appended command 'python ~/.fleetwood.py' in shell configs -> execution upon shell startup",
  "anomalies": "Fetching remote code during package installation; writing to user environment files without validation; broad exception handling suppressing errors; automatic modification of user configs for code execution",
  "analysis": "The code downloads content from a hardcoded URL, writes it to a hidden file, and modifies user shell configuration files to execute this script automatically. It does not validate or authenticate the remote content, and exceptions are suppressed, concealing errors. These behaviors are characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks or malware, enabling remote code execution and persistence. The straightforward nature of the code indicates no obfuscation. The pattern of fetching and executing remote scripts, especially during package installation, poses a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to remote code fetching, persistent execution setup, and error suppression. It should be considered highly suspicious or malicious, warranting a malware score close to 1 and a security risk score of 1.0.",
