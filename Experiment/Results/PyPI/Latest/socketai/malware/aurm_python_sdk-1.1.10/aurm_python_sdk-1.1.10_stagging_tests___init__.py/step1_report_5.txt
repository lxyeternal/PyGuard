  "purpose": "Initialize the package and expose 'test_function' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .module1 import test_function'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data output present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports and defines the __all__ variable without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard package initialization code with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py file used to define package exports. It imports 'test_function' from a local module and sets __all__ to expose it. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated elements. The structure and content are consistent with standard Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply exposes a function from a local module.",
