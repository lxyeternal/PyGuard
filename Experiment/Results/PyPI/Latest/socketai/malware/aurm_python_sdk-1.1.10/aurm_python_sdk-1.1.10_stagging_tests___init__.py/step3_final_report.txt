  "purpose": "Standard package initialization (__init__.py) importing a function from a sibling module and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1 importing test_function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import of test_function from .module1, then exposure via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package __init__.py file that imports a function and exposes it. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, with consistent scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
