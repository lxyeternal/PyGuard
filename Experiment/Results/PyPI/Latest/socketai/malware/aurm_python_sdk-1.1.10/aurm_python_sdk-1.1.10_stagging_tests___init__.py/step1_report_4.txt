  "purpose": "Initialize the tests package by importing test_function from module1 for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the import simply makes test_function available",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard package initialization pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that imports test_function from module1 within the same package and exposes it via __all__. It performs no data processing, network communication, or other security-sensitive actions. There are no signs of malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious or security-related issues. It simply exposes a test function for use within the testing framework.",
