{
  "purpose": "The code initializes the tests package by importing a specific test function from module1.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to potential data leaks or malicious effects are present",
  "flows": "The source (importing test_function) is only used within the module for testing purposes; no data flow to external sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer that imports a test function from a sibling module. It sets __all__ to expose only the test_function. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors. The code adheres to typical Python package conventions and contains no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package __init__.py file for tests, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
