  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static greeting string, likely a placeholder or test module.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or data reads present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the function returns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal function with no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify its benign, static nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or suspicious elements. No issues or vulnerabilities are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a trivial, benign function with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
