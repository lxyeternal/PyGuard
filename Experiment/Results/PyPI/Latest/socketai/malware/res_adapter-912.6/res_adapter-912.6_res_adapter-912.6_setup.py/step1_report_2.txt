  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes code from main.py.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports modules and executes a function from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function from main.py is executed during installation, which could perform arbitrary actions.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method calls main() from main.py, which may contain further untrusted behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code from main.py during setup, which is unusual and potentially risky. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools for package configuration. It defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that runs the normal install process and then imports and executes 'main()' from main.py. This behavior during setup can be exploited if main.py contains malicious code. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network operations visible in this snippet. The primary concern is executing arbitrary code at install time, which could be malicious if main.py is compromised or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a function from main.py during installation, which poses a security risk if main.py is malicious or compromised. This behavior is unusual for standard setup scripts and could be exploited for malicious purposes. No other malicious indicators are evident in this snippet.",
