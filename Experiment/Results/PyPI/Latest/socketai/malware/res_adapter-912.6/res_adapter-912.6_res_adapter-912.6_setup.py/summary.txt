  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, depending on main.py's content. The current scores are appropriate but should be slightly increased to reflect the inherent risk of arbitrary code execution during installation. Further review of main.py is recommended to confirm its safety."
