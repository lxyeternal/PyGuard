{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it via HTTP GET requests to multiple suspicious external URLs, potentially for data exfiltration or tracking.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint() for generating a unique identifier.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending HTTP GET requests with system info embedded in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from sources and directly transmitted to external URLs via constructed GET requests without validation or user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious domains (notably oast.fun), hardcoded URLs, transmission of data in URL parameters without encryption, no user notification, and use of a random number for URL differentiation.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly collects system info and transmits it to multiple external servers, including known malicious domains. The absence of obfuscation and malicious payloads suggests the activity is primarily covert data exfiltration or tracking. The suspicious domains and unencrypted transmission indicate malicious intent or privacy invasion. The code’s behavior aligns with typical exfiltration tactics, and no benign explanation is evident. The malware score of 1 is justified due to the clear exfiltration activity to malicious domains, and the security risk score of 1 reflects the high threat level. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the straightforward nature of the code and the suspicious domains involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to known malicious domains, with no obfuscation or payloads, indicating malicious intent. The activity poses a high security risk and warrants classification as malicious. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
