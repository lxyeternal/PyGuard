  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs for reporting or tracking purposes.",

  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send HTTP GET requests with system data as URL parameters",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, username, current directory) is collected and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple remote URLs",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious-looking domains, including a known malicious domain (oast.fun), and sending potentially sensitive system info without user consent; hardcoded URLs and parameters; use of random number for URL path.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current working directory. It generates a random number for URL differentiation. It then constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or tracking domains and sends HTTP GET requests with system info as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious, especially given the use of a domain associated with malicious activity (oast.fun). The code does not perform any validation or user consent, and it leaks system details to external servers. No obfuscated code or malware signatures are present beyond this data exfiltration activity. The code may be used for malicious tracking or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This code attempts to exfiltrate system information to suspicious external servers without user consent, indicating malicious intent. It could be part of a supply chain attack or malicious tracking tool. The use of known malicious domains and untrusted data transmission warrants a high security alert.",
