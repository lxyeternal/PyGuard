  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object from a local module 'main' within the package.",
  "sources": "Reading the local module 'main' and the symbol 'perm' within it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Import statement establishes a static reference; no runtime data flow or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import in Python, with no embedded malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. Given the simplicity, there are no sources of untrusted data, no data flows, and no suspicious patterns. The import does not execute code or perform network operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with this analysis. Without additional context about 'main' or 'perm', the code appears benign. The high confidence scores are justified due to the minimal and clear nature of the snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or adjustment is necessary based solely on this snippet.",
