  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet as it only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, simply an import statement with no additional logic. No anomalies are present in this isolated line.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. It does not process data, perform I/O, or execute any logic that could be malicious. The simplicity suggests this is a typical import, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and typical for Python projects, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
