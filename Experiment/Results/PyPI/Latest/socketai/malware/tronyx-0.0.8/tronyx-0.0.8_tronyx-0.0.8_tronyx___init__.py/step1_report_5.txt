  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, only a relative import statement, no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple relative import of 'perm' from a module named 'main'. There are no apparent security issues, no data inputs, no code execution, and no complex logic. The minimal nature makes it unlikely to be malicious by itself, but the security implications depend on the contents of 'main' and 'perm'.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet alone appears benign, serving as an import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Further context about 'main' and 'perm' would be needed for a more comprehensive assessment.",
