  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides Flask testing utilities, including environment builders, test clients, and CLI runners. It uses standard libraries, Flask, and Werkzeug, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions are typical for testing frameworks, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious flows are present.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low, justified)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing Flask testing utilities, environment handling, session management, and CLI invocation. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with standard testing practices, with no signs of malicious intent. It manipulates environment and session data within safe, controlled contexts.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (justified)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on extending Flask testing with custom clients and environment builders. Uses standard libraries, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is clearly for testing purposes, with no malicious actions or vulnerabilities. It operates within expected parameters.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes testing utilities, environment setup, session handling, and CLI invocation. Uses standard Flask and Werkzeug modules, no suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, code injection, or sabotage. The code is a typical testing utility.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others—testing utilities, environment builders, session management, no malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The code is standard for testing Flask apps.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (justified)\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior; the score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code is purely for testing utilities, the low risk scores (~0.1) are reasonable, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear, readable code.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — Slightly above zero, acknowledging the code's role in testing environments but with no inherent security risk.\n\n**Note:** The code is safe, standard, and does not pose any supply chain or security threat based on the provided content.",
