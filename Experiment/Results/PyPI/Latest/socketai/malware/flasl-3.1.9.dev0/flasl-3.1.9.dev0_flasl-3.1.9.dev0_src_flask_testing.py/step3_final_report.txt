{
  "purpose": "The code provides testing utilities for Flask applications, including environment builders, test clients, and CLI runners, facilitating request simulation, environment setup, and session management during testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, app configuration, request objects, session data, and environment builders.",
  "sinks": "Request environment, session storage, and response headers (e.g., Set-Cookie). No external network calls or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables and request parameters through environment builders and session handlers, ultimately affecting request and response objects within controlled testing contexts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured testing utilities for Flask, involving environment setup, request simulation, session handling, and CLI testing. It relies on standard libraries like Werkzeug and Flask, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The functions manage request contexts, environment copying, and session persistence safely within testing scenarios. No external network activity, code injection, or data leakage is present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation to 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the utility nature of the code and its safe implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe set of testing utilities for Flask applications. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided source. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
