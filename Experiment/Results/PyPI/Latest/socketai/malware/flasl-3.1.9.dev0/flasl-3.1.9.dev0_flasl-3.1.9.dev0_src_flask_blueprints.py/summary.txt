  "conclusion": "The code is standard and safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is unvalidated filenames potentially leading to directory traversal, which is a common issue in static file serving but not inherently malicious in this context. Proper validation should be enforced outside this code to mitigate this risk."
