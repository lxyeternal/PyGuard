  "purpose": "Defines a Blueprint class extending SansioBlueprint for Flask-like application, managing static files, resources, and CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Configuration value access (current_app.config), class initialization parameters, method parameters (filename, resource, mode).",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory (serving static files), open() calls for resource files.",
  "flows": "Configuration value (SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT) → get_send_file_max_age; filename → send_from_directory; resource → open()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No use of untrusted input sources beyond typical parameters. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No network activity, cryptomining, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a Flask-like blueprint class that manages static files, resources, and CLI commands. It accesses configuration values in a standard manner, serving static files via send_from_directory and opening resource files with open(). All data handling appears controlled and related to serving or opening files, with no evident untrusted data flow or malicious intent. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The only potentially sensitive aspect is the use of configuration for cache control, which is standard practice. Overall, no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a Flask blueprint extension for static file serving and resource management without any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured component with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
