{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom Blueprint class for a Flask-like web framework, extending functionality for static file serving, resource opening, and CLI command grouping.",
  "sources": "Config values from current_app.config, input parameters for methods (filename, resource, mode), and the import statements.",
  "sinks": "Open file operations (open()), send_from_directory(), and potential return of Response objects.",
  "flows": "Configuration values influence get_send_file_max_age() output; filename and resource inputs are used in file operations; send_static_file() and open_resource() interact with filesystem based on inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The open() calls are constrained to reading modes only, which minimizes risk. No network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles static file serving and resource management within a web framework. It safely uses configuration values, validates input modes for reading files, and manages static file responses. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The operations are standard for a web server environment. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate component of a web framework, responsible for static file serving and resource handling. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in this code segment.",
