  "purpose": "Defines a Flask-like Blueprint class for managing static files and resources, including methods for serving files and opening resource files.",
  "sources": "Configuration values from current_app.config, filename and resource parameters passed to methods.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory and open() filesystem operations.",
  "flows": "Configuration influences cache headers; filename and resource parameters flow into file-serving functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard framework component for static file and resource management. It relies on external validation for filenames; without explicit sanitization, there is a potential for directory traversal if filenames are untrusted. The use of send_from_directory and open() is typical, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The code validates modes for opening resources, reducing certain risks. Overall, the code appears safe but depends on external validation for filename safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and safe, with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is unvalidated filenames potentially leading to directory traversal, which is a common issue in static file serving but not inherently malicious in this context. Proper validation should be enforced outside this code to mitigate this risk.",
