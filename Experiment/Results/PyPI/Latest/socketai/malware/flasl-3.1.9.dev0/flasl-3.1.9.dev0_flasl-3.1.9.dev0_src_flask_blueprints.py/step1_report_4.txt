{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Blueprint class for a web framework, extending SansioBlueprint, and provides methods for serving static files, opening resources, and managing associated CLI commands.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructor, get_send_file_max_age method, send_static_file method, open_resource method.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory (serves files), open (opens resource files).",
  "flows": "Static file serving flow from get_send_file_max_age to send_from_directory; resource opening flow from open_resource to open() function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious file paths, no malicious code injection, no obfuscated code, no network calls, no data exfiltration points.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a web framework blueprint class. It relies on configuration values and standard library functions for serving static files and opening resources. The methods do not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. The import statements are typical for such a module, and no unsafe dynamic code execution or external network connections are present. The class manages static files and resources in a typical, expected manner without any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate framework code for managing blueprints, static files, and resources. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code's functionality aligns with normal web server behavior. No security threats or malicious behaviors are detected.",
