  "purpose": "This code configures the Sphinx documentation for the Flask project, setting themes, extensions, links, and a custom role for GitHub source linking based on version info.",
  "sources": "The get_version function providing the release/version, environment variables accessed via app.config.release, and user input 'text' in the github_link role.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL in github_link referencing the GitHub repository, based on version info and user input.",
  "flows": "User input 'text' is used to generate a URL; version info influences URL path; no external data or code execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; URL construction is standard; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Sphinx configuration with a custom role for linking to GitHub. It constructs URLs based on static base URLs and version info, with no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious code. The use of get_version and environment variables is standard. The URL generation based on user input is controlled and used solely for linking, not executing code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The risk score of 0.1 reflects minimal, typical dynamic URL creation, which is safe in this context. The malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The code is transparent and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with a safe URL generation pattern. There is no malware, obfuscation, or security risk present. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior.",
