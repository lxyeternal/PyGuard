  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The script is a standard Sphinx configuration with a custom role for GitHub links. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation detected. URL generation relies on static data and version info, with no external calls or code injection.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign, standard configuration code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code constructs URLs for GitHub based on version info and user input text. No suspicious behavior or external data leaks. Slight concern about dynamic URL creation, but it’s based on static strings and version info.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Confidence slightly lower (0.9) but still reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent; risk is minimal and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code reads version info and constructs URLs for GitHub links, typical for documentation. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Uses standard modules and practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Confidence high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** Benign configuration script.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar pattern—configuration code with dynamic URL creation based on version info. No suspicious or malicious behavior. No external network activity or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Confidence high (0.95).\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard practice.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, a standard setup for documentation with URL construction based on version info. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external calls.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Confidence high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the dynamic URL generation based on version info and user input, but these are standard practices and do not constitute security risks.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script with a custom role for linking to GitHub source files.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The dynamic URL generation based on version info and user input is standard and safe in this context.\n- The minor risk scores (0.1) are justified due to the dynamic URL construction but do not indicate actual security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.05** — Slightly above zero, justified by dynamic URL generation, but overall very safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard documentation configuration script with no security risks or malicious intent.",
