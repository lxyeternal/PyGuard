{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that re-exports various components, classes, and signals from internal modules, likely to provide a public API for a web framework such as Flask.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules within the package; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; purely static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only establishes namespace exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, typical of a framework's __init__.py or API exposure module. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. The import pattern is standard and does not involve any suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the static, benign nature of this code. The malware scores are appropriately zero, and the risk scores are minimal, reflecting the lack of any malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard module re-export pattern used in web frameworks like Flask. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's static and safe nature.",
