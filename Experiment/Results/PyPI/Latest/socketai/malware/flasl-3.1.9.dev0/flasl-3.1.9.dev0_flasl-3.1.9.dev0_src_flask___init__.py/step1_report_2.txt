{
  "purpose": "This code is a module that imports various functions, classes, and signals from different parts of a web framework, likely Flask, to expose them for use within the application.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .json, .app, .blueprints, .config, .ctx, .globals, .helpers, .signals, .templating, .wrappers",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; imports are static and do not involve data handling at runtime",
  "flows": "The code does not process data flows; it only imports components for later use",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, such as dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; imports are straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, referencing internal modules and exposing functions, classes, and signals related to a web framework. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or runtime execution beyond static imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All imported modules appear to be part of a standard web framework setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import module typical in web frameworks like Flask. It does not contain malware or security risks based on its static structure. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is safe.",
