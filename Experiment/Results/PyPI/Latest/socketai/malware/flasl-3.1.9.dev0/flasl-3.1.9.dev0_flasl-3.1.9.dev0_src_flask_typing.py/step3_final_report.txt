  "purpose": "Static type annotations and type aliases for Flask/Werkzeug response/request handling, facilitating static type checking.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions, union types, and conditional imports for static type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only type annotations and no runtime data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static type definitions do not involve data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward type annotation definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliases, union types, and conditional imports intended for static type checking in Flask/Werkzeug applications. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external calls. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of static type annotations for Flask/Werkzeug, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and non-malicious nature. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
