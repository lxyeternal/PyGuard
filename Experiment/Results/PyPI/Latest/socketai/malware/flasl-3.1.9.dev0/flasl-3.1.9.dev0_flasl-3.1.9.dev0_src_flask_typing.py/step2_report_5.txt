  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as purely defining type aliases, imports, and annotations for Flask/Werkzeug.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external calls are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code is intended solely for static type checking, which reduces the risk profile significantly.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code contains no executable logic or data handling, only type annotations and imports. No issues are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the type annotations or structure.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are consistent with the described static, non-executable nature of the code.\n- **Malware justification:** The malware score is 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is purely for static analysis support.\n- **Scores justification:** The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly 0; no security risks identified.\n- **Type annotations:** Properly used, with conditional imports for type checking, union types, and type variables, all standard practice.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical type definition module for Flask/Werkzeug.\n- It is safe, non-executable, and serves only static analysis purposes.\n- No signs of malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward type annotations)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks or vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe and standard for static type annotations in a web framework context.",
