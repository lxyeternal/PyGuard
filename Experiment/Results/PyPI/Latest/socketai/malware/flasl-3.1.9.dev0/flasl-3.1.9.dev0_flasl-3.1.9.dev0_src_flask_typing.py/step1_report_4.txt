{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and type variables for a web framework, likely Flask or Werkzeug, to facilitate type checking and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Type hints, import statements, and variable annotations for response types, headers, request/response callbacks, and error handlers.",
  "sinks": "None detected; the code primarily involves type annotations and class/type variable definitions without runtime data handling or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "None explicitly; the code defines types used elsewhere in a web framework, but no data flow or input/output operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code strictly defines types and annotations without dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing modules and conditionally imports framework-specific classes for type checking purposes. It defines several union types for response values, headers, and callback functions relevant to web request/response cycles. All constructs are standard, well-structured, and serve as type hints for static analysis, with no runtime data processing or potential for malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a typical type annotation module for a web framework, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious type annotation definition module for a web framework. It contains no suspicious patterns, no malicious code, or security risks. It is purely for static type checking purposes.",
