  "purpose": "Define type aliases and callable signatures for use in a Flask/Werkzeug web application framework, primarily for request and response handling, middleware, and route functions.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imports, including t.TYPE_CHECKING, and imported classes from Werkzeug and other modules.",
  "sinks": "Type annotations used for route responses, request processing, and middleware callbacks; no data sinks or external calls present.",
  "flows": "Type definitions for request/response flow within the web application, but no actual runtime data flow or external data transfer detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code consists solely of type alias declarations and import statements; no runtime or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type alias definitions for Flask/Werkzeug web application handlers and responses. It uses standard Python typing constructs, conditional imports for type checking, and generic type variables. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external calls that could be exploited. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely for type annotation purposes in a web framework context. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and unlikely to be used maliciously.",
