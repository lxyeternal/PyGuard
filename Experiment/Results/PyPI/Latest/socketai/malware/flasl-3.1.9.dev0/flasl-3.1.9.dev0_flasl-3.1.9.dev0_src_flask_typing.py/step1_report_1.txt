  "purpose": "Type annotations and type aliases for Flask/Werkzeug web framework response and request handling.",
  "sources": "import statements; type alias definitions; conditional import blocks for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None detected; code primarily defines type aliases and imports.",
  "flows": "None, as there are no executable flows or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected. The code is solely for type annotations and does not perform data processing or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type aliases and import statements for typing support in Flask/Werkzeug. It uses conditional imports for type checking, defines various union types for response values, headers, and request/response callback signatures. There are no executable parts, no data flows, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type annotations related to Flask/Werkzeug. It does not contain executable logic, data handling, or external communication that could be malicious. Overall, it appears safe and serves as static typing support.",
