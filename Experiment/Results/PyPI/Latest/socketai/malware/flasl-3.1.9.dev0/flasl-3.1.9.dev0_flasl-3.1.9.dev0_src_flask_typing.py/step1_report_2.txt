{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and aliases for HTTP response handling, request lifecycle hooks, and related constructs in a web framework context (likely Flask or Werkzeug).",
  "sources": "Type annotation imports and definitions, including standard typing module, conditional type checks, and type variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks; no code execution or data handling that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "Type annotations provide static type information; no runtime data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code is purely type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions, imports, and conditional type checks for static typing support. It imports types from standard and third-party libraries, declares type unions, type variables, and callable signatures for web request lifecycle hooks. There is no executable logic, data handling, or potentially malicious behavior present. It appears to be a typical type definition module for a web framework's request/response system.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only static type definitions and imports aimed at type checking in a web framework context. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activities are detected. It is a safe, non-executable configuration for type annotations.",
