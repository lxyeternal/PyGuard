{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases and type variables for a Flask or Werkzeug-based web application, specifying expected input and output types for various request/response handling functions.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and import statements, especially the use of t.Union, t.TypeVar, and import of standard and third-party types.",
  "sinks": "Type alias assignments, type variable definitions, and type annotations for functions such as AfterRequestCallable, BeforeRequestCallable, etc.",
  "flows": "Type annotations provide expected data types but do not process or manipulate data directly; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns. The code purely consists of type annotations and imports, with no runtime logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "This code establishes type annotations and aliases to facilitate static type checking in a Flask/Werkzeug application. It imports necessary types, defines unions for response types, headers, and callback functions. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious behavior. All code is standard for type hinting and does not perform any operations or data processing. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs are present. The code is purely declarative, meant for static analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type alias definitions for a web framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process data at runtime or contain any suspicious patterns. Overall, it appears safe and intended for type checking support.",
