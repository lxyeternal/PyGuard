  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Flask CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The primary concern is the inherent risk of dynamic code execution based on user input, which is standard for such tools. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. Proper validation of inputs can mitigate potential exploitation risks, but no active malicious behavior is detected."
