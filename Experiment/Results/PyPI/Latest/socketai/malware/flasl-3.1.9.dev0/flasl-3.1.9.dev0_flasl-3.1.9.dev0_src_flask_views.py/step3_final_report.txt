  "purpose": "Defines class-based views for a web framework, enabling request dispatching and method handling with support for decorators and request-global data.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing, current_app, request, and class attributes such as methods, decorators, and init_every_request.",
  "sinks": "Calls to current_app.ensure_sync() executing dispatch_request or HTTP method handlers, based on request data.",
  "flows": "Request method (request.method) flows into method lookup (e.g., get, post), which is then invoked via ensure_sync, passing URL variables as kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious external calls, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Standard pattern for web frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a typical class-based view system with dynamic method dispatch, decorator application, and request handling via ensure_sync. It relies on external globals (current_app, request) but does not process untrusted data insecurely or include malicious payloads. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign component of a web framework, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
