  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic, unencrypted data exfiltration of system info without user consent, raising privacy and security concerns. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The behavior warrants a high security risk score but a low malware score. The code should be treated with caution due to its potential misuse, but technically it is not malware."
