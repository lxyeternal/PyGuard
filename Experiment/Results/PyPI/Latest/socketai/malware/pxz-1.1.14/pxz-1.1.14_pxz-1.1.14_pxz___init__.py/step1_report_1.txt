{
  "purpose": "Collect and send system information including public IP, hostname, user directory, current directory, and current time to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reading public IP via urlopen('https://api.ipify.org'), reading hostname with os.uname(), expanding user directory with os.path.expanduser('~'), current directory with os.getcwd(), getting current time with datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "Sending data via urlopen() request to remote server 'http://35.170.187.220:8080/' with encoded system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Source data (public IP, hostname, directories, time) is encoded into URL parameters and sent through an HTTP GET request to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "Code automatically executes on import, which could be considered suspicious. Data is sent unencrypted over HTTP, which is insecure. The IP address of the server could be suspicious, especially if unknown or untrusted. No explicit user consent or configuration is shown.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system details such as public IP, hostname, user home directory, current working directory, and timestamp. It then encodes this information into URL parameters and makes an HTTP GET request to a remote IP address (35.170.187.220:8080). The data transmission occurs automatically upon module import, which could be used maliciously to exfiltrate user environment data without user knowledge. The use of URL encoding and a fixed server address suggests it may be part of a data collection or potential exfiltration tool. No malicious code injections, backdoors, or malware behaviors are directly observed, but the automatic and unencrypted data exfiltration raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to gather system info and automatically sends it to a remote server upon import. While this may be for benign purposes like telemetry, the lack of user consent, automatic execution, and transmission over insecure HTTP raise suspicion for malicious or unwanted behavior, such as data exfiltration or privacy invasion.",
