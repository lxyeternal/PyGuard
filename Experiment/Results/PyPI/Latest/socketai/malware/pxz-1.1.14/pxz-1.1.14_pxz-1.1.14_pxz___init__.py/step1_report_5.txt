{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as public IP, hostname, directories, and current time, then send this data to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network (https://api.ipify.org), system environment (os.uname(), os.path.expanduser, os.getcwd()), and system time (datetime.now()).",
  "sinks": "The collected data is encoded and sent via an HTTP request to a remote server at http://35.170.187.220:8080/.",
  "flows": "Source: URL request to api.ipify.org -> Gathered system info (public IP, hostname, directories, time) -> Encode parameters -> Send via HTTP request to remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically executes upon import, collecting potentially sensitive system info and transmitting it without user consent or explicit invocation. The destination server IP is hardcoded. No user input validation or encryption of transmitted data.",
  "analysis": "The script collects publicly accessible system data, including the public IP address, hostname, home directory, current working directory, and timestamp. It then encodes this data into URL parameters and sends an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address. The operation is performed automatically at import, with no user interaction. No obfuscation, encryption, or user notification is present. The data transmission could be used for tracking or unauthorized surveillance. The code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious payloads like system damage or backdoors. However, the automatic and silent data exfiltration, especially to an IP address not associated with a known service, is suspicious and could be malicious if used without user knowledge or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and transmits it to a remote server immediately upon import. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking. No malicious code such as system damage or backdoors is present, but the automatic data collection and transfer without user consent is suspicious and potentially malicious from a privacy standpoint.",
