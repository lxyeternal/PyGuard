  "purpose": "Collects and sends system information including public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp to a remote server.",
  "sources": "urlopen('https://api.ipify.org') to get public IP; os.uname() for hostname; os.path.expanduser('~') for home directory; os.getcwd() for current directory; datetime.now() for timestamp.",
  "sinks": "urlopen(req) which sends data to a remote server at 35.170.187.220:8080.",
  "flows": "System info is collected from sources and encoded into URL parameters, then sent via HTTP GET request to the specified server.",
  "anomalies": "Code actively collects detailed system info and transmits it without user consent or obvious purpose; no authentication or encryption; no validation or logging of responses. The server IP and data collection appear suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers various system details, including public IP and hostname, and sends this data to an external IP address, which could be used for tracking or surveillance. The request is made over HTTP without encryption, raising privacy concerns. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious library usage; however, the behavior of collecting and transmitting system info without user knowledge is suspicious. The code could be part of a malicious surveillance or data exfiltration tool, depending on context. It is straightforward and does not contain malicious payloads like executing arbitrary code or accessing sensitive files.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and transmits it to an external server. While technically simple, this behavior can be considered malicious or intrusive, especially without user consent. It potentially serves as a privacy violation or part of a covert data collection mechanism. The code itself does not contain malware or obfuscation but performs suspicious activities.",
