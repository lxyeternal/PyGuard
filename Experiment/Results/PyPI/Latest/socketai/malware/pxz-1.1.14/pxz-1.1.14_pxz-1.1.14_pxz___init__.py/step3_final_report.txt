{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (public IP, hostname, directories, timestamp) and sends it via HTTP GET to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads public IP from URL, retrieves hostname via os.uname(), expands user home directory, gets current working directory, and timestamp from datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "Sends data through urllib.request.urlopen() to a fixed IP address via HTTP GET request.",
  "flows": "Data collected from sources flows directly into URL parameters, which are sent over the network to the specified server.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic execution upon import; data sent over insecure HTTP; hardcoded server IP; no user notification or consent; no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly collects system info and exfiltrates it to a remote server without encryption or user awareness. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The behavior resembles covert data collection, which is suspicious, especially due to automatic execution and unencrypted transmission. The server IP is hardcoded, and data is sent immediately upon import, indicating potential privacy invasion. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious system modifications are detected. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.2-0.3, risk ~0.6-0.75) are consistent with this behavior. Given the lack of malicious payloads but considering privacy implications, the overall security risk is high, but malware presence is unlikely.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic, unencrypted data exfiltration of system info without user consent, raising privacy and security concerns. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The behavior warrants a high security risk score but a low malware score. The code should be treated with caution due to its potential misuse, but technically it is not malware.",
