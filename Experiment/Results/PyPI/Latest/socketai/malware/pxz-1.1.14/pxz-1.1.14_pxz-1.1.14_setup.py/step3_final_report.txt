{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines package metadata for the 'pxz' Python package, including name, version, description, author info, license, classifiers, packages, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata fields such as name, version, description, author, license, classifiers, and package list.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted input or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only declares package metadata without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The description claims the package 'collects and sends system information,' but this functionality is not implemented in this setup script; it appears only as metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup configuration with no executable logic, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify this as benign. The mention of data collection in the description is misleading but not reflected in the code. Malware scores are appropriately zero, and confidence levels are high. No obfuscation or security risks are present in this script. The actual malicious behavior, if any, would reside in the runtime code of the package, which is not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. The description's claim about data collection and transmission warrants further review of the runtime package code, but based solely on this setup configuration, there are no security concerns.",
  "confidence": 1,
