  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior in the Provided Snippet**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a standard `setuptools` setup script.\n   - No data collection, transmission, or runtime code is present in this snippet.\n   - The description mentions \"collects and sends system information,\" but this is only in metadata, not actual implementation.\n   - **Conclusion**: The code itself does not contain malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that the setup script is benign.\n   - They correctly identify that any potentially malicious activity would be in the package's runtime code, not in the setup script.\n   - No logical flaws or errors are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are low or zero, consistent with the benign nature of the setup script.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is reasonable given the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - Since the setup script does not perform any data collection or transmission, and no malicious code is present, risk scores should remain very low.\n   - The only concern is the description implying data collection, but this is not reflected in the code.\n   - **Therefore**, risk scores should stay at 0 or very close to it.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - No malicious activity is indicated or implied by this setup script.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they note that the actual behavior depends on the package code, which is not provided.\n   - They correctly identify that the setup script alone is not suspicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — setup script alone is benign; potential malicious behavior depends on runtime code not shown here.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The main concern is the description stating the package \"collects and sends system information,\" which could be suspicious if the actual package code performs such actions. However, based solely on this setup script, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n- If the actual package code (not provided) contains data collection or transmission, that would need separate review and possibly higher risk/malware scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The current scores are appropriate given the provided code. No changes are necessary.",
