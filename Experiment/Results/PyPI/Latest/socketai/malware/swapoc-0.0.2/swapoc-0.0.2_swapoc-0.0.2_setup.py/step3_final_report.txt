  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README' file for long_description; static metadata fields in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads README -> Calls setuptools.setup() with static data; no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Description field set to 'for rce', which is suspicious but not malicious; filename 'README' is non-standard but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only suspicious element is the description 'for rce', which could imply malicious intent but is merely metadata. All reports correctly identify the static nature, assign zero malware and obfuscation scores, and assign low to moderate security risk based on the description. The code does not perform any network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The risk scores are appropriate given the metadata concern. No active malicious code or obfuscation detected; the description warrants caution but does not indicate an active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign and standard. The only concern is the description string 'for rce', which is suspicious but not indicative of active malicious behavior. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk, with no malware or obfuscation present.",
