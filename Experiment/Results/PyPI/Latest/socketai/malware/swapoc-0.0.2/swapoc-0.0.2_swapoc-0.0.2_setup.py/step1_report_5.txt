  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the swapoc Python package including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long_description; static package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no code execution or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No flow of untrusted data or code execution paths detected.",
  "anomalies": "The description field 'for rce' is suspicious, potentially indicating intent for remote code execution, but it is only a descriptive string, not executable code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setuptools package setup, reading a README file and configuring package metadata. No dynamic code execution, no input handling beyond static file reading, and no suspicious logic. The only notable point is the 'description' field mentioning 'for rce', which could be a sign of malicious intent or a placeholder, but as it is not code, it does not pose a direct security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior. The mention of 'for rce' in description is suspicious in wording but not executable. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
