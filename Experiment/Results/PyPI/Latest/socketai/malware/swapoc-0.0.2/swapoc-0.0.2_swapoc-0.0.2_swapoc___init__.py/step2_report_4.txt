  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the justification for the assigned risk levels.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior detected; code appears standard; confidence 0.7; malware 0; security risk 0.2.\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning aligns with the low malware and security risk scores. The confidence is moderate, considering the incomplete context.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** No evident malicious behavior; high confidence (0.9); malware 0; security risk 0.2.\n- **Analysis:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious activity detected. The high confidence is justified.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Suspicious behaviors noted—dynamic code execution, obfuscation, network activity; malware 0.2; security risk 0.3; obfuscated 0.4; confidence 0.6.\n- **Analysis:** The report mentions signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution but concludes no definitive malicious payloads. The malware score of 0.2 seems low given the described suspicious behaviors.\n- **Issue:** The malware score should reflect the potential for malicious activity. The presence of dynamic code execution and obfuscation, even if not confirmed malicious, warrants a higher malware score, perhaps 0.4 or 0.5.\n- **Recommendation:** Increase malware score to around 0.4 to better reflect the suspicious patterns, while maintaining the overall cautious stance.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Incomplete code, no suspicious activity; confidence 0.6; malware 0.\n- **Analysis:** Given the lack of code, the low risk and malware scores are justified.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** No signs of malicious activity; standard imports; confidence 0.7; malware 0.\n- **Analysis:** The reasoning aligns with the scores.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Adjustments:\n\n- **Report 3:** Increase malware score from 0.2 to approximately **0.4** to better reflect the suspicious behaviors (dynamic eval, obfuscation, network activity) noted in the analysis.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** Given the evidence, most reports are benign, but Report 3's suspicious patterns suggest a malware score around **0.4**.\n- **Obfuscated:** Only Report 3 shows obfuscation, so about **0.4**.\n- **Risk:** The overall security risk remains low (~0.2-0.3), except for Report 3, which should be around **0.4**.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores should be consistent with the level of suspicious activity described. The primary concern is Report 3, which warrants a higher malware score due to the signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, even if no malicious payload is confirmed.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated | Risk Score |\n|---------|-----------------|--------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0               | 0            | 0.2        |\n| 2       | 0               | 0            | 0.2        |\n| 3       | **0.4**         | **0.4**      | **0.4**    |\n| 4       | 0               | 0            | 0.2        |\n| 5       | 0               | 0            | 0.2        |\n\nThis reflects a balanced, critical assessment aligned with the evidence.",
