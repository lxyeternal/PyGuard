{
  "purpose": "The code performs asynchronous initialization by calling _refresh_runtime() at module import time, and exposes utility functions and helpers.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (.core, .utils, ._config) and calls _refresh_runtime() within an async function executed at import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident; no external data or user input handling occurs in this fragment.",
  "flows": "The initialization flow involves calling _refresh_runtime() asynchronously during module load, but no user input or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs asynchronous setup during import, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines an async function to refresh runtime configuration. It then ensures this function is run at import time, handling both scenarios of an existing event loop or not. This pattern facilitates background initialization without blocking. The code structure is standard for asynchronous setup and does not show signs of malicious behavior. There are no embedded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard asynchronous initialization procedure without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a legitimate package setup process, with no evidence of malware or security issues.",
