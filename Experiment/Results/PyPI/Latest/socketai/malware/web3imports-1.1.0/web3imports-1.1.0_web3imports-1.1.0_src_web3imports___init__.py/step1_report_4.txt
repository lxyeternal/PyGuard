{
  "purpose": "To perform asynchronous background initialization by refreshing runtime configuration when the module is imported.",
  "sources": "The code imports from local modules (.core, .utils, ._config) and uses asyncio to manage event loops.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code initiates a coroutine (_refresh_runtime) which runs asynchronously at import time, either via asyncio.run() or schedule on an existing loop.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The use of asyncio.run() in a module import context is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules and sets up an asynchronous initialization process that refreshes runtime configurations. It checks if an event loop is running; if not, it starts one with asyncio.run(). If an event loop exists, it schedules the coroutine asynchronously. This pattern is standard for async initialization, though its use during module import can have implications in certain environments. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's main purpose appears to be configuration setup, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard asynchronous initialization for configuration refresh without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. Its structure and content are benign, primarily focusing on setup tasks during import.",
