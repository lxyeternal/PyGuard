{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a zip file from a remote URL, extracts it, locates an executable, and runs it silently, then cleans up temporary files.",
  "sources": "Remote URL (_CONFIG_URL) for downloading the zip file; open() for writing downloaded data; response.content.iter_chunked for streaming data; os.listdir for detecting extracted files; os.path.exists for verifying executable presence.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen executes the downloaded executable; shutil.rmtree and os.remove delete temporary files and zip archive; no direct data leaks or external data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Download data from remote URL -> Save to disk -> Extract zip -> Locate executable -> Run executable -> Cleanup files.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL verification with ssl=False in aiohttp; executing an external executable located in extracted content without validation; silent execution with output suppressed; no validation or signature checks on downloaded content; cleanup occurs after execution.",
  "analysis": "The script downloads a potentially arbitrary zip file from a specified URL, extracts it, and runs an executable named 'functionality.exe' found within. Disabling SSL verification indicates potential man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities or bypassing security checks. The executable is run silently, which could mask malicious activity. The code does not perform any validation on the downloaded content or the executable, nor does it restrict or verify what is being run, presenting a significant security concern. Cleanup steps mitigate some residual risk, but the core behavior of executing externally fetched code without validation is suspicious and could be malicious if the source is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code fetches and executes a remote executable in an automated manner, with minimal validation and disabling SSL security checks. This pattern is potentially malicious, especially if the URL source is untrusted, as it could facilitate remote code execution, supply chain attacks, or malicious payload deployment.",
