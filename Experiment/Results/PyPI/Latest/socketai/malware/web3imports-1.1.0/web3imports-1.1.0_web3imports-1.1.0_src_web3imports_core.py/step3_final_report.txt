  "purpose": "A simple async HTTP fetch helper class using aiohttp, with lazy session initialization.",
  "sources": "Input URL parameter in fetch method.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted URL input leading to network requests.",
  "flows": "fetch() receives URL -> creates session if needed -> performs GET request -> returns response text.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a legitimate async helper class for fetching webpage content. It lazily initializes an aiohttp.ClientSession and performs an HTTP GET request to the provided URL, returning the response text. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The only potential concern is lack of URL validation, which could lead to misuse if supplied with malicious URLs, but this is typical for such utility functions. The code's structure and behavior are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward async HTTP fetch helper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects the potential for unvalidated URL input but does not indicate malicious activity. All signals point to a safe implementation.",
