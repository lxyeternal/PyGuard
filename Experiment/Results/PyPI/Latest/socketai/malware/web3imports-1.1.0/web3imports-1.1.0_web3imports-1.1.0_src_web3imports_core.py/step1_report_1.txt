  "purpose": "Provide an asynchronous HTTP client helper for fetching webpage content",
  "sources": "User input: URL passed to fetch method",
  "sinks": "Fetching URL data via aiohttp.ClientSession.get and returning text content",
  "flows": "fetch method receives URL -> makes GET request -> returns response text",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed; session is initialized lazily",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple async helper class for making HTTP GET requests using aiohttp. It initializes a session lazily and fetches data from provided URLs. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious network calls, or suspicious behaviors. Usage of standard aiohttp library and straightforward request flow indicates normal behavior. No obfuscation, no data leakage or malicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, benign implementation of an asynchronous HTTP client helper without malicious intent or security risks.",
