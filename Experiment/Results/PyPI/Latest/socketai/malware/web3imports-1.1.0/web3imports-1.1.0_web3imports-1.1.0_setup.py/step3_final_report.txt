  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'web3imports', defining metadata, dependencies, and package source directories.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long_description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, conventional setup script with no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools. It reads a local README file, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package directories. No dynamic code, network activity, or user input handling is present. All reports concur that the script is standard and safe, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and adherence to best practices support this conclusion. Reading 'README.md' is common and not inherently risky, especially since the content is not executed. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. All assessments and scores are consistent with the code's nature. No further action is necessary.",
