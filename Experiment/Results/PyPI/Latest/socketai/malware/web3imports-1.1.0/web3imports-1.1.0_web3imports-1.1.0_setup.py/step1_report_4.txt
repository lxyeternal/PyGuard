  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging a Python project named 'web3imports'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Source is reading the README.md file, which is a static file; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to configure the package, including metadata and dependencies. It reads a local README.md file for long_description, which is standard practice. No external or untrusted inputs are processed beyond static file reading. The package dependencies and metadata appear typical. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The code structure and format follow standard conventions for Python packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup configuration script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a normal part of Python package distribution, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
