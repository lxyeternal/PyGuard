  "purpose": "Initialize the package namespace by importing 'test_function' from 'module1' and exposing it publicly.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'test_function' from a local module 'module1'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the import of 'test_function' from 'module1' to the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The file is a standard '__init__.py' used to set up package exports. It imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it via '__all__'. There are no signs of malicious activity, no data leaks, no code injection points, and no suspicious behaviors. It serves a simple package initialization purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
