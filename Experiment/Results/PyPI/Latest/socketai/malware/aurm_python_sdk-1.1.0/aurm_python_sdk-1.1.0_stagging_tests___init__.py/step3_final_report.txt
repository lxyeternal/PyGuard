  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer that imports 'test_function' from the local module 'module1' and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module '.module1' during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data outputs; the code does not process external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement from '.module1', which is then exposed through __all__, with no further data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file that imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and clarity support the conclusion that it is safe and typical for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
