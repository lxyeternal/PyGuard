  "purpose": "This file initializes the package namespace by importing 'test_function' from 'module1' and exposing it publicly.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'test_function' from 'module1' into the namespace; no data flow from external sources within this file.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package initializer that imports a function from a local module and declares it as part of the public API. There are no signs of malicious activity such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization with no malicious or security concerns identified.",
