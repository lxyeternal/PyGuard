  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The original code is a simple function returning a static string with no external dependencies, inputs, or complex logic.\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion**: There are no issues or malicious activities present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no external interactions or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - **Suggestion**: No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, the risk score is correctly low.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, so this is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - No overestimations are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and match the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, all scores are appropriate. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the actual code behavior.",
