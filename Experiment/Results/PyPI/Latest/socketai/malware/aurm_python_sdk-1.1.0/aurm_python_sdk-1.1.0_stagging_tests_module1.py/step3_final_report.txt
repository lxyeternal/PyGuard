{
  "purpose": "A simple test function returning a static string, serving as a benign placeholder or example.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or environment variables; static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications; purely static output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; function simply returns a constant string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial function with no inputs, outputs, or side effects. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the clear, straightforward code. No external dependencies or data flows are involved, further confirming its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static function with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
