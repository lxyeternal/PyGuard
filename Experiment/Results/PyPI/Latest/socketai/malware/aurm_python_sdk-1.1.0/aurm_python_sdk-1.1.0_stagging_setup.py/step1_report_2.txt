  "purpose": "Configure setup for the 'aurm-python-sdk-fleetwood' package, including custom installation behavior that fetches and executes remote data.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb' which is accessed via urllib.request.urlopen during installation.",
  "sinks": "Writing to user home configuration files (~/.fleetwood.py, ~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile) and executing content that includes 'python ~/.fleetwood.py'.",
  "flows": "Remote URL data is fetched and written into ~/.fleetwood.py; then a command to run this script is added to shell config files; during execution, the script is run, potentially executing remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Fetching code from an external URL and writing it directly into a file in the user's home directory, then executing it via a shell command. The code manipulates shell startup files to run remote code on shell startup, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command to include fetching a script from a remote URL during package installation. It saves the downloaded content into a local file (~/.fleetwood.py), then attempts to add a command to execute this script into user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). This operation occurs unconditionally, with exception handling that suppresses errors. Such behavior indicates an attempt to establish persistent remote code execution via user shell startup scripts. This is highly suspicious, as it can facilitate remote code execution and data exfiltration. The rest of the setup code appears normal, including dependency specification and package metadata. No obfuscated code or encrypted payloads are present. The fetch-and-execute pattern, combined with modification of user shell config files, suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior that can be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively downloads and executes remote code during installation, modifies user shell configuration files to persist remote execution, and suppresses errors to ensure the behavior proceeds silently. These are significant security concerns, indicative of malicious or potentially malicious intent. This package poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
