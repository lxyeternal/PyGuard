{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a setup process that includes executing potentially malicious code on Windows systems, possibly to perform covert operations or sabotage during installation.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from platform.uname(), os.path.exists(), open() file reads, environment variables, subprocess.check_output(), and encrypted data stored within base64 strings that are decrypted at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include sys.exit(), subprocess execution, os.path.exists(), file reads, decryption and decryption verification, dynamic execution with exec(), and process detection functions that could trigger malicious behavior.",
  "flows": "Code flow starts with checks for the operating system, then executes a function that decrypts and runs obfuscated code via exec(). It reads system information, checks for debugging or sandboxing, decrypts embedded payloads, and then executes them dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated base64-encoded strings, runtime decryption, use of exec() on decrypted code, functions that check for debuggers, process checks for sandboxing or analysis tools, and cryptographic operations indicating payload concealment. The code only runs on Windows and terminates otherwise.",
  "analysis": "The script is a setup configuration that incorporates an embedded, encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed during installation. It performs system environment checks for debuggers, virtual machines, or sandboxing indicators, suggesting anti-analysis techniques. The core payload is obscured by multiple layers of base64 encoding and runtime cryptographic operations, which are often used to hide malicious intent. Usage of exec() with decrypted code is a critical indicator of potentially malicious behavior, as it allows executing arbitrary code. The code's structure and obfuscation strongly suggest an attempt to hide malicious payloads or sabotage the host system upon installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains highly suspicious, obfuscated payload execution that leverages runtime decryption and dynamic code execution, indicative of malicious intent. It likely aims to perform covert operations such as system sabotage, data exfiltration, or backdoor installation during the package installation process. The code’s intent aligns with supply chain sabotage and malware deployment, with multiple anti-analysis techniques to evade detection.",
