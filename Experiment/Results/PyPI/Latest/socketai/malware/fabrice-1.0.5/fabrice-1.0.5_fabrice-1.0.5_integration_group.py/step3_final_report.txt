  "purpose": "The code defines a test suite for fabric's remote command execution, testing successful commands, failure handling, and exception management on local and invalid hosts.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded hostnames/IP addresses ('localhost', '127.0.0.1', 'nopebadhost1', 'nopebadhost2') used in fabric Group instantiation and commands.",
  "sinks": "The group.run() method executes commands; exceptions like GroupException and gaierror are caught, but no untrusted data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "flows": "Source: hardcoded hostnames/IPs -> group.run() executes commands -> exceptions (GroupException, gaierror) are caught and processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with static data, no obfuscation, and no malicious payloads or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite for fabric's remote command execution, handling success and failure scenarios on local and invalid hosts. It uses static hostnames/IPs and commands, with standard exception handling. No untrusted input, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The exception handling is appropriate, and the commands are safe. The use of invalid hosts is for testing error handling, not malicious intent. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign testing script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should reflect zero malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (~0.0–0.2). The current assessments are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
