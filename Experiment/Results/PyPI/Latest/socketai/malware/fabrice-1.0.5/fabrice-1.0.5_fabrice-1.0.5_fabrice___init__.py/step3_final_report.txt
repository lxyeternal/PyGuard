  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization file, exposing internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules, typical of a package's __init__.py. There are no dynamic executions, data handling, network operations, or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal, and malware activity is absent. The scores in the reports generally reflect this, though some overstate risk levels; the overall assessment is that the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup file with no malicious or security concerns. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0 across all reports.",
