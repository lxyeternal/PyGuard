  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is just import statements, no malicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Since the code is straightforward imports with no suspicious activity, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The securityRisk score of 0.9 seems high given the benign nature. Unless there's an underlying concern about the modules themselves, this should be lower. The high securityRisk score is unjustified here.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0, malware remains 0, obfuscated remains 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard import statements, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is benign. The securityRisk should be 0.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower securityRisk to 0, malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, just import statements, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) may reflect minimal concern, but given the benign code, this is likely overstated.\n- **Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0, keep malware=0, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard imports, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same benign import pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n- **Malware Score:** All are 0, which is correct; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The scores of 0.9 and 1.0 in reports 1 and 2 are unjustified. The code is benign, and these should be 0.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent across all reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** Given the code's simplicity, I would set the overall risk score to **0** for all reports, unless there are contextual concerns not visible here.\n\n**Summary:** The reports correctly identify the code as benign, but the risk scores assigned in reports 1 and 2 are overstated. They should be lowered to reflect the actual benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical package import setup with no security issues. The high risk scores are unwarranted based on the provided code snippet.",
