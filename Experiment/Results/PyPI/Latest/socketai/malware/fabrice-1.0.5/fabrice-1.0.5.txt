The only minor concern is the use of exec() for version reading, which is acceptable in trusted environments. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. The security risk is low, primarily due to the exec() pattern, but it should be used with trusted files."

The minor security concern relates to exposing host info in __repr__, which is typical for debugging but should be handled carefully in production logs. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
