  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Automation of packaging, release, testing, documentation.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, c.config, env object.\n- **Sinks:** Environment variable modifications, sys.path manipulation, shell commands.\n- **Flow:** Environment variables influence configuration and command execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets ('sikrit'), insecure environment modifications, static credentials.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious payloads, but insecure practices with hardcoded secrets and environment modifications.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, insecure practices but no malware.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code does not contain malicious payloads; the main concern is insecure handling of secrets.  \n- The flow from environment variables to commands is typical but could be exploited if environment is maliciously set.  \n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious activity).  \n- Obfuscated: **0**.  \n- Risk score: **0.4** (low, due to insecure secrets).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, release, testing, documentation.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, hardcoded strings.\n- **Sinks:** c.run commands, environment modifications.\n- **Flow:** Environment variables and hardcoded secrets influence execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded passwords ('sikrit', 'mypass'), static credentials.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; typical build script with insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, just insecure secrets.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious payloads; the code performs standard automation.  \n- Static credentials are security concerns but not malicious.  \n- Malware score: **0**.  \n- Obfuscated: **0**.  \n- Risk score: **0.3**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, test, release, with configuration.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, user inputs, imported modules.\n- **Sinks:** c.run commands, environment variables.\n- **Flow:** Environment variables and parameters influence commands and environment setup.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded passwords ('sikrit', 'mypass'), environment setup.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious payloads; standard build/deploy script with insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malware or malicious activity detected.  \n- Static secrets are security risks but not malicious.  \n- Malware score: **0**.  \n- Obfuscated: **0**.  \n- Risk score: **0.3**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, release, testing, documentation.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, user inputs, configuration.\n- **Sinks:** c.run commands, environment variables.\n- **Flow:** Environment variables and secrets influence commands.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded passwords, environment variable manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious payloads; typical build script with insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malware detected.  \n- Static secrets pose security concerns but are not malicious.  \n- Malware score: **0**.  \n- Obfuscated: **0**.  \n- Risk score: **0.3**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build and deployment automation.\n- **Sources:** Environment variables, hardcoded strings.\n- **Sinks:** c.run commands, environment modifications.\n- **Flow:** Environment variables and secrets influence commands.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded passwords, environment variable use.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious payloads; standard build/deploy with insecure secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malware detected.  \n- Hardcoded secrets are security issues but not malicious.  \n- Malware score: **0**.  \n- Obfuscated: **0**.  \n- Risk score: **0.3**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is standard for build and deployment tasks.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated due to insecure practices (hardcoded secrets, environment modifications), but no active exploits or malware.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious payloads or activity).\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code).\n- **Risk:** Considering insecure secrets and environment modifications, but no active malicious behavior, a score around **0.3** seems appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical build automation script with insecure practices (hardcoded secrets, environment modifications). There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or active exploits. The primary concern is security hygiene, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nImprove secret management practices to eliminate hardcoded secrets and review environment variable handling for potential exploitation.",
