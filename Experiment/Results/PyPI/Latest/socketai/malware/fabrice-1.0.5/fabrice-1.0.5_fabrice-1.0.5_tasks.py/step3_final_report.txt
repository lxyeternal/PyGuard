  "purpose": "Automation tasks for package release, testing, documentation, and deployment workflows using invoke.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION', 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2'), c.config settings, imported modules, hardcoded credentials ('sikrit'), sys.path modifications.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands via c.run, environment variable modifications, sys.path alterations, fabric environment configuration, connection objects, static password usage.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and config data influence command execution and environment setup; static secrets are used directly in code, affecting control flow and environment configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'mypass'), static environment variable manipulations, removal of sys.path entries, insecure credential handling, no obfuscation or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build, test, and release automation with insecure practices such as hardcoded secrets and environment modifications. No malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or sabotage behaviors are evident. The flow from environment/config to command execution is typical but could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously set. The presence of static secrets poses security risks but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an automation script with insecure practices but no active malicious intent or payloads. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is absent, and the risk score of approximately 0.4 reflects insecure secrets without active exploitation or malicious behavior.",
