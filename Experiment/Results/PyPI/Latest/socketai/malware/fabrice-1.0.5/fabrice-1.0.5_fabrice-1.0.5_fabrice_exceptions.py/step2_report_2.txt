  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings and comments.\n   - No data handling, external calls, environment variable access, or other dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, serving as structural components for error handling.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors.\n   - The only comment is a TODO note suggesting future refactoring, which does not impact current security.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or external data processing.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, aligning with the clear, straightforward code.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of any security vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Assessment of Logic & Reasoning in Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent, thorough, and correctly conclude that the code is harmless.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the actual code content.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Any Issues or Discrepancies?**\n   - No. The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation & Recommendations**:\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the reports' thoroughness, I agree with the assigned scores.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions for use elsewhere. It is safe, non-malicious, and carries no security risks. The reports are accurate and well-justified.",
