  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   The code defines four custom exception classes: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`. These are straightforward, with no embedded logic, data handling, or external interactions. The comments indicate future refactoring considerations but do not introduce any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   - No code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, environment variable manipulations, or network calls.\n   - The TODO comment is benign and common in development workflows.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: Given the absence of any malicious behavior, the malware score should be 0. The current reports correctly assign 0.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: The code is clear and readable, with no obfuscation. The assigned 0 is appropriate.\n   - **Risk Score**: Since the code is purely structural with no security implications, a low risk score (e.g., 0.0 or 0.1) is justified. The current reports mostly assign 0, which aligns with this.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments**:  \n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Recommendations**:  \n   - The code is standard exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n   - The scores assigned (all 0s for malware and obfuscated, 0 for security risk) are appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Summary & My Estimated Scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Security Risk**: 0 (no security issues present)  \n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. They correctly identify this as harmless, structural code meant for exception handling.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring and analysis are appropriate.",
