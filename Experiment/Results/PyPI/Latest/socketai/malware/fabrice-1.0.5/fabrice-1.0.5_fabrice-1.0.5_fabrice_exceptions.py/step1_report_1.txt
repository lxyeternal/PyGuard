{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios related to group results, environment validation, and potential TODO notes for future refactoring.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes without any data input, environment variables, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted inputs or outputs are present.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable comment is a TODO note suggesting future code refactoring, but no suspicious or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of exception class definitions with docstrings and comments. There are no data handling, external calls, or potentially malicious constructs. The TODO comment indicates planned future changes but does not impact current security. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions without any malicious or security-risk behavior. It appears to be standard, harmless Python code intended for exception handling in larger projects.",
