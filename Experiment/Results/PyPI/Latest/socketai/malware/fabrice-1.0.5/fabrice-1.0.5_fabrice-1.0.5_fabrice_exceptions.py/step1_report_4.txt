{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python application, likely related to task execution and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code only declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; comments suggest possible future code relocation or refactoring but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception class definitions: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. These classes are simple, with no embedded code execution, data handling, or external communication. The comments indicate considerations for code organization but do not introduce security concerns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The classes serve as structural components for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for Python projects, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
