{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Exception class constructors and docstrings, no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output, no untrusted data handling or external data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of standard class and exception definitions, with comments indicating potential future refactoring.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings and minimal logic. No input parsing, data handling, or external interactions are present. The comments suggest consideration for future code restructuring but do not introduce suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code is evident. The purpose appears to be local error handling, not malicious or security-critical code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of custom exceptions for managing error states related to task grouping and environment validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
