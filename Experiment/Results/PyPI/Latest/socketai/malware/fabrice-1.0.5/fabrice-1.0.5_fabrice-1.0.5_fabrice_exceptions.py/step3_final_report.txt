  "sources": "Class definitions with no data input, environment variables, or external calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with comments indicating future refactoring.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no logic, data handling, or external interactions. Comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not introduce malicious behavior. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard, benign, and purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and carries no security risks. All indicators confirm it is a benign structural component with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
