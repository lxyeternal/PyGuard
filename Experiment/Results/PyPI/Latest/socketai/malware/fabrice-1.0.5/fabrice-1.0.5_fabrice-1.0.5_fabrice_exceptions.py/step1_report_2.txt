  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions within a larger Python application or framework.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only class and exception definitions with no suspicious logic, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining custom exceptions to be used elsewhere in an application. No external data handling, no use of environment variables, network operations, or malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated logic present. The comments suggest possible future code organization but do not impact security. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain any indicators of malware or security issues.",
