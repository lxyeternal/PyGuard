  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a larger Python project, likely related to task execution or environment management.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and comments, no input or data reading mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions with no suspicious code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple custom exception classes, including 'NothingToDo', 'GroupException', and 'InvalidV1Env'. These are straightforward and contain no data handling, network access, or code execution. The comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not introduce any malicious behavior. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The overall structure is typical for exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and safe, serving as custom exception definitions for larger codebase use. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present.",
