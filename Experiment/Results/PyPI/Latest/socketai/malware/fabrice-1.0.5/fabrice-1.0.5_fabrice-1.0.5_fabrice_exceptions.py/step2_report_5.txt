  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the underlying code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Structure**:\n   - The code only defines three custom exception classes: `NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, and `InvalidV1Env`.\n   - There are no data inputs, external calls, network operations, or data processing.\n   - The comments include TODO notes for future refactoring but do not influence current behavior.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Security Implications**:\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as exception classes for larger applications.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, environment variable manipulations, or external data handling.\n   - No code execution, dynamic behavior, or obfuscation.\n   - The comments are benign and suggest future code organization, not malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious behavior, code, or payloads.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks identified; the code is harmless.\n\n4. **Assessment of Report Validity**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is harmless, straightforward, and standard.\n   - The high confidence (1.0) across reports is justified.\n   - No inconsistencies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reported scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is entirely benign, serving as part of a larger exception handling framework. No malicious or security-critical issues are present.",
