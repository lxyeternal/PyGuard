  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data processing, external calls, or environment variable usage.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities.\n- Comments indicate potential future refactoring but do not suggest malicious intent.\n- All reports assign maximum confidence (1.0) and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward class definitions with no logic that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - No external data, no network calls, no environment variable access.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - Confirmed: **No issues are present in the code.**\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as harmless, purely structural, and standard.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning detected.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The reasoning for these scores aligns with the code content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**\n   - None of the reports justify any high risk scores; all assign 0.\n   - This is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n   - Scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they are cautious and accurate.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code is standard exception class definitions, typical in many Python projects, with no security concerns. The thoroughness of the reports is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Confirmed issues:** None\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, benign, and contains no security threats.",
