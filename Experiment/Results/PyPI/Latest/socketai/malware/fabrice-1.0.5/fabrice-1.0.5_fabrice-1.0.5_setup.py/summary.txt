  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-structured setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of exec() for version reading, which is acceptable in trusted environments. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. The security risk is low, primarily due to the exec() pattern, but it should be used with trusted files."
