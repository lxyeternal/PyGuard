  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, dynamically selecting package and binary names based on environment and directory structure.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py' via exec(), reads README for long description, environment variables, and directory checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and directory checks influence package naming; exec() executes '_version.py' to obtain version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to parse '_version.py' could be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with standard practices. The use of exec() for version extraction is common but introduces a potential security concern if '_version.py' is compromised. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The environment-dependent logic for package naming is straightforward. Overall, the script is safe assuming the integrity of '_version.py'.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, well-structured setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only minor concern is the use of exec() for version reading, which is acceptable in trusted environments. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. The security risk is low, primarily due to the exec() pattern, but it should be used with trusted files.",
