{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2' depending on environment variables and directory structure, configuring package dependencies and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), reads directory structure to detect 'fabric' or 'fabric2' folders, reads the 'README.rst' file, reads the '_version.py' file inside the package.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup()' to install dependencies, set entry points, and other metadata; executes code from '_version.py' to obtain version info.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences package name and binary name -> directory structure detection influences package name -> reading of '_version.py' file influences version info -> reading 'README.rst' influences long description -> 'setuptools.setup()' consolidates all info to perform installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected; environment variable is used for configuration but not inherently malicious; code is straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically configures package attributes based on environment variables and directory presence, reads version info from an external file, and reads README content for long description. The setup parameters such as dependencies, author info, and entry points appear standard. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The code performs typical package setup tasks without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It dynamically configures package attributes based on environment and directory structure, which is common in flexible setup scripts.",
