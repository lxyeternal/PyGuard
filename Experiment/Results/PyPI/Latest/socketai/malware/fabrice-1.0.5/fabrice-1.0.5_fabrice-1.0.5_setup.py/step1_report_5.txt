  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and configure a Python package for distribution, including dependency management, versioning, and entry point configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', reading of '_version.py' file, reading 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variable, reading files, executing code from '_version.py', and passing parameters to setuptools.setup()",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2' influences package selection -> reading '_version.py' and 'README.rst' -> executing '_version.py' content -> passing data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of 'exec' to execute contents of '_version.py' can be risky if the file is maliciously modified, but it is a common pattern for version reading. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including dynamic package selection based on environment variables and directory checks, reading version info from a file via 'exec', and configuring package metadata and dependencies. The use of 'exec' on a local version file is typical but warrants caution if the file is compromised. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears clean and intended solely for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. The use of 'exec' is typical for version management but should be verified to ensure the '_version.py' file is trustworthy. Overall, there are no security risks or malware present.",
