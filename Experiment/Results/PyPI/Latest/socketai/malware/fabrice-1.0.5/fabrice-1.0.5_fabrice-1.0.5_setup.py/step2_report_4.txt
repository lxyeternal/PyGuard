  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard setup script; no malicious activity; use of 'exec' is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code performs typical setup functions. The 'exec' on '_version.py' is common in setup scripts, assuming the file is trusted. No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; notes 'exec' usage but considers it typical; confidence slightly lower (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe cautious note about 'exec' is valid. The securityRisk score of 0.2 reflects minimal concern due to 'exec' usage, which is acceptable in trusted build environments. No malware detected. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights 'exec' on '_version.py' as a potential security concern, especially if the file is compromised.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.4, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a more conservative stance, emphasizing that 'exec' could be risky if the '_version.py' file is malicious. The score of 0.4 for securityRisk is justified, considering the potential for malicious code execution if the version file is tampered with. No actual malware detected, but the potential risk is acknowledged.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; no suspicious activity; standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; emphasizes 'exec' pattern is typical but should be verified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nReasonable. The cautious approach is appropriate given the 'exec' usage.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. The code is a standard setup script.\n- **Malware:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risks:** The main concern is the use of 'exec' to read '_version.py'. While common, it can be risky if the file is compromised.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The 'exec' usage warrants a security risk score around 0.4, which aligns with the most conservative report.\n- The malware score remains at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- Confidence levels are high; the code is straightforward.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.4 (due to 'exec' on local version file; acceptable if the file is trusted)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script with minimal security concern primarily centered on the use of 'exec' for version extraction. No malware or malicious intent is evident. The scores should reflect that, with a moderate security risk due to the 'exec' pattern but no actual threat.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** For enhanced security, consider replacing 'exec' with safer alternatives like importing the version module directly or reading the version string explicitly, if feasible.",
