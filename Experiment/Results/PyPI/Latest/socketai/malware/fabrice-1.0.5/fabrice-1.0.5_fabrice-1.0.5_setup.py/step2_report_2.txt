  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the code, and determine the appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Standard setup script; no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Use of 'exec':** Common pattern for reading version info; not inherently malicious.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Confidence:** 1 — appropriate.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate, no issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; notes 'exec' usage but considers it typical.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated due to 'exec' but acceptable given context.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.  \n**Verdict:** Correct assessment; 'exec' usage is standard but warrants minimal caution.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Highlights the 'exec' on '_version.py' as a potential security concern.  \n- **Analysis:** 'exec' can be risky if '_version.py' is malicious or tampered with.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected, but the potential risk is acknowledged.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.4 — slightly elevated, reflecting the inherent risk of executing code from a file.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.8 — appropriate given the concern.  \n**Verdict:** Correctly identifies the 'exec' as a possible vector but finds no actual malicious behavior.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; emphasizes standard setup procedures.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate, given no malicious activity.  \n- **Confidence:** 1 — justified.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the script; acknowledges 'exec' usage but considers it typical.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.  \n**Verdict:** Correct.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree there is no malware. The 'exec' usage, while potentially risky, is a common pattern in setup scripts and does not constitute malware.  \n- **Obfuscated code:** None of the reports mention obfuscation, and the code is straightforward. Score remains 0.  \n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated in some reports due to 'exec' usage, but given the context, it remains low (0.2-0.4). I agree with these assessments.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — primarily due to 'exec' on a local version file, which is a common but slightly risky pattern if the file is compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The only point of concern is the use of 'exec' to read version info, which is standard but should be maintained with trusted files. No malware or malicious intent is evident.",
