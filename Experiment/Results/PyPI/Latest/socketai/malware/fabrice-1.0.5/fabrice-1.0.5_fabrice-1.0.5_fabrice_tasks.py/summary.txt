  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign extension for remote task management, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The minor security concern relates to exposing host info in __repr__, which is typical for debugging but should be handled carefully in production logs. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
