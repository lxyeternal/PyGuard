{
  "purpose": "The script gathers system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then exfiltrates this data via multiple webhooks.",
  "sources": "Requests to api.ipify.org; reading environment variables (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, USERPROFILE); reading files from local storage paths; reading and querying browser SQLite databases; reading JSON files for game accounts.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to decoded URLs (webhooks) with exfiltrated data.",
  "flows": "System info, tokens, passwords, and accounts are collected from various sources and sent directly via HTTP POST requests to external URLs, with fallback to multiple webhooks if the primary fails.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple base64-encoded URLs that are decoded at runtime; use of requests for network communication; access to browser storage, Discord tokens, and game account files; potential collection of sensitive user data; redundant webhook fallback logic; no user consent or notifications; broad file system access that can gather sensitive info; presence of functions that exfiltrate data without any user permission.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by decoding four base64-encoded URLs, likely used as webhook endpoints for exfiltration. It then defines functions to gather system information, including username, computer name, hardware ID, and public IP, which are sensitive data points. It scans specific directories for Discord tokens using regex, searches browser local storage for saved passwords (potentially encrypted), and reads game account files from specific paths. The send_to_webhook function posts collected data to multiple URLs, with a series of fallbacks if the primary webhook fails. The main 'color' function orchestrates data collection and exfiltration. Overall, the script is designed to stealthily gather and transmit sensitive user information to external servers, indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior intended for data theft and privacy invasion. It covertly collects sensitive user data such as system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and game accounts, then exfiltrates this data to external webhooks using multiple fallback URLs. The obfuscation through base64 encoding of URLs and broad system access further support its malicious profile. The overall security risk is high, and the code should be considered malicious.",
