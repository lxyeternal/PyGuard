{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then exfiltrates this data to multiple URLs.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables, file system paths (Discord storage, browser login data, Minecraft configs), and system commands (hardware ID).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST requests to external URLs (decoded from base64), potentially leaking sensitive information to these endpoints.",
  "flows": "The code gathers data from sources, compiles it into strings, and then transmits it to remote URLs through HTTP POST requests in the 'send_to_webhook' function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding for URLs; multiple fallback webhook URLs; collection of Discord tokens, passwords, and Minecraft account info; system commands executed to get HWID; no validation or encryption of collected data; printing of suspicious messages; no user consent or obvious benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script performs extensive collection of potentially sensitive user data, including Discord tokens, browser credentials, and system info. It employs base64 encoding/decoding to hide URLs and uses multiple fallback endpoints for data exfiltration. It reads from browser login databases, Discord storage, and system files, indicating intent to harvest credentials and tokens. The code sends this data to remote servers without encryption or user consent. The repeated fallback requests to different URLs suggest an attempt to ensure data reaches an external server. Overall, this behavior aligns with malicious data theft or espionage. The code structure and logic do not suggest obfuscation or benign debugging; rather, it appears designed to surreptitiously extract and exfiltrate user information.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior characteristic of information-stealing malware. It harvests sensitive user data and exfiltrates it to external servers using multiple fallback URLs. The code lacks any benign purpose, user prompts, or encryption, and appears explicitly designed for clandestine data theft.",
