{
  "purpose": "Collect system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then send this data to multiple webhooks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, USERPROFILE), system commands (wmic), file system (leveldb files, JSON files, SQLite database), network requests (requests.get and requests.post).",
  "sinks": "Requests POST requests to external URLs, reading files with sensitive data, extracting and exfiltrating tokens, passwords, and account info, executing system commands to gather hardware info.",
  "flows": "Extracts URLs from base64-encoded strings -> Gathers system info -> Finds tokens/passwords/accounts -> Sends collected data via HTTP POST to decoded URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Encoded URLs potentially obfuscate malicious endpoints; multiple fallback webhook URLs; extraction of Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts; use of subprocess to get HWID; extensive exfiltration pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily aims to exfiltrate sensitive user data including system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and game account details, and then send this data to multiple external webhooks, which is typical of malicious data theft malware. It decodes multiple obfuscated URLs for exfiltration, indicating an attempt to hide the true destinations. It gathers system info via system commands and environment variables, which could be used for identification or further malicious activities. The code reads sensitive information such as stored passwords and tokens from user directories and browsers. The fallback mechanism for webhooks suggests an attempt to ensure data exfiltration even if primary endpoints are blocked or unavailable. The code is designed for stealth and persistence, with no benign purpose apparent. Overall, it demonstrates malicious intent to steal and transmit user data surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior aimed at collecting and exfiltrating sensitive user data, including system details, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and game accounts, to multiple external endpoints. The use of obfuscated URLs, environment variable access, and broad data collection functions strongly indicates malware functionality. It is highly unsafe to execute or include in any package.",
