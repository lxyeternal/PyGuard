{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then exfiltrates this sensitive information via multiple fallback webhooks encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, USERPROFILE), filesystem files (leveldb, login data, accounts.json), system commands (wmic), and network requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to decoded URLs with the collected data, which can lead to data leakage and privacy violations.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from sources such as environment variables, files, and system commands, then passed to the send_to_webhook function, which attempts to exfiltrate via multiple fallback URLs decoded from base64, in sequence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for URLs as a form of obfuscation; broad data collection without user consent; multiple fallback URLs for exfiltration; no input validation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes multiple base64-encoded URLs used for data exfiltration, collects sensitive user data including system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts from various locations, and sends this data via HTTP POST requests to multiple fallback webhooks. The use of base64 encoding indicates an attempt to hide the destination URLs, and the broad data harvesting combined with multiple fallback endpoints suggests malicious intent. The code operates silently without user consent, and the exfiltration points are designed for persistence. These behaviors are characteristic of malware aimed at privacy invasion and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior, acting as an information stealer with obfuscated exfiltration URLs and broad data collection. It is highly likely to be malicious, with high confidence and risk scores.",
