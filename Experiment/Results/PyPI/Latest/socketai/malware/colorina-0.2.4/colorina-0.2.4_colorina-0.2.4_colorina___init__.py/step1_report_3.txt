  "purpose": "The code collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then exfiltrates this data via multiple webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, filesystem (leveldb files, JSON configs, database files), subprocess commands, and network requests.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent over the network via HTTP POST requests to several decoded URLs, which are used as webhook endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables, filesystem scans, subprocess commands, and JSON files flow into data collection functions, which then send the data via HTTP POST requests to multiple URLs, with fallback mechanisms if initial requests fail.",
  "anomalies": "The code decodes multiple base64-encoded URLs and attempts to send collected data to all of them sequentially. It gathers sensitive data such as Discord tokens, browser passwords, system info, and Minecraft accounts without user consent. The repeated webhook posting with fallbacks and the broad collection of sensitive info are suspicious. The use of multiple fallback URLs suggests an attempt to ensure data exfiltration. The code does not perform any user interaction or clear user benefit.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to collect sensitive user data including Discord tokens, saved browser passwords, system information, and Minecraft accounts. It then exfiltrates this data to multiple webhook URLs encoded in base64. The collection methods involve filesystem scans, environment variable access, subprocess commands, and reading JSON configurations, which are typical for malicious data harvesting. The use of multiple fallback URLs indicates an intent to reliably send data even if some endpoints are blocked. The code does not appear to perform any malicious system modification or malicious payload execution; its primary goal seems to be stealthy data exfiltration. The overall structure, including the repeated webhook requests and broad data collection, strongly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data exfiltration tool that stealthily harvests sensitive user information and sends it to multiple remote servers. The behavior is consistent with malware designed for information theft, with no legitimate user benefit or transparency. The presence of multiple fallback URLs, broad data collection, and the absence of user interaction strongly indicate malicious intent.",
