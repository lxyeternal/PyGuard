{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code simply calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the setuptools library and calls it with default parameters. It performs a basic package setup without additional configuration or custom code. This is typical for Python package setup scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalous patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply invokes the setup process with default options, which is common in Python packaging.",
