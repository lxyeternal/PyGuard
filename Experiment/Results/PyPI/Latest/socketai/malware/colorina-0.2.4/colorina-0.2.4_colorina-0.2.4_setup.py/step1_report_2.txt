{
  "purpose": "This code is used to configure and run the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only calls the setup() function from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code simply calls setup() without parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; there are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from setuptools and calls it without any arguments. This is a typical pattern in Python package setup scripts. No additional logic, input processing, or data handling is present. The code does not contain any signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard minimal setup invocation without any malicious or suspicious activity. It poses no security risk and appears legitimate for package configuration.",
