  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "The setup() function is invoked without arguments, so no data flows or transformations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with no parameters. This is typical for package setup scripts. No data input, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior are observed. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It contains no hidden or malicious behavior.",
