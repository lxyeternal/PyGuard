  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by importing specific modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') and aliasing them under the 'requests.packages' namespace to ensure consistent module access across environments.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' modules; access to these modules via __import__ and sys.modules.",
  "sinks": "Manipulation of sys.modules to alias modules under 'requests.packages.*', affecting module resolution within the Python environment.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported and then assigned into sys.modules with new keys, influencing how modules are resolved when imported elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual direct manipulation of sys.modules for namespace aliasing; no user input or external data processing; straightforward code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and reassigns them in sys.modules under a different namespace for compatibility. It does not perform any network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. Manipulating sys.modules can be risky if the environment is compromised, but in this context, it is a known pattern used for legacy support. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security breach is evident. The code's purpose is purely to maintain module namespace consistency, and it operates within expected parameters for such a task.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility shim that manipulates sys.modules to alias modules under the 'requests.packages' namespace. It does not contain malicious activity or backdoors. The low security risk stems from the fact that sys.modules manipulation could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but as implemented, it is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal but potential risk in an untrusted environment.",
