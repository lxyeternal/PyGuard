  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup script reading version info and README.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The only notable sink is the 'os.system' commands during 'publish'. The flow is straightforward.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report notes the use of 'exec' on the version file and 'os.system' calls, but considers them standard and not malicious. The 'exec' could be risky if the version file is compromised, but in typical setup scripts, this is common practice.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes the script is safe, with high confidence.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the 'exec' and 'os.system' usage. It notes potential risks but finds no malicious intent.\n- The reasoning aligns with standard practices.\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Highlights the 'exec' on '__version__.py' and 'os.system' calls for publishing.\n- Recognizes that 'exec' can be risky if the version file is compromised but notes this is common.\n- The securityRisk is slightly higher (0.3), which is reasonable given the 'exec' usage.\n- No malware detected.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.3 — acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar observations about 'exec' and 'os.system'.\n- Correctly identifies that these are standard but potentially risky practices.\n- SecurityRisk is 0.2, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same pattern: 'exec' and 'os.system' are used, but no malicious intent.\n- Confirms that the code is typical for setup scripts.\n- SecurityRisk is 0.2.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The use of 'exec' is standard in setup scripts but can be risky if the version file is compromised; however, it is not inherently malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero mainly due to the 'exec' usage, which is common but could be exploited if the version file is maliciously altered.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The 'exec' on an external file is the only point of concern, but in this context, it's standard practice. The risk is minimal unless the version file is tampered with.\n- The 'os.system' commands are static and do not process external input, so they pose little risk.\n- The overall code is safe and does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to 'exec' usage, but this is standard in setup scripts)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malware. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' on an external version file, which is common but should be verified for integrity in secure environments.",
