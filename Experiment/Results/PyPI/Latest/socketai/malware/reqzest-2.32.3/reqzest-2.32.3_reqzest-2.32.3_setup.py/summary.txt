  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent. The use of 'exec()' on an external version file is a known pattern but can be risky if the file is compromised. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.2-0.3) are appropriate and justified."
