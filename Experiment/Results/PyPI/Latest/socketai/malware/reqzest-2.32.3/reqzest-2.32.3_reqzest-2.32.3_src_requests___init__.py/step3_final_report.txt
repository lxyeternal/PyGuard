  "purpose": "Dependency validation, environment compatibility checks, and setup routines for the 'requests' library.",
  "sources": "Imports of version variables, dependency modules, environment checks, and warnings.",
  "sinks": "Assertions, warnings, and environment modifications; no data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Version strings are checked and assertions are made; warnings are issued based on environment conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Standard dependency and environment validation routines; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks, suppresses warnings, conditionally imports modules, and adjusts environment settings. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Assertions could cause runtime halts if dependencies are incompatible, but this is typical for setup routines. No external data flows or network activity are evident. The code is straightforward and well-documented, aligning with standard library initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup routine for dependency validation and environment configuration within the 'requests' library. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
