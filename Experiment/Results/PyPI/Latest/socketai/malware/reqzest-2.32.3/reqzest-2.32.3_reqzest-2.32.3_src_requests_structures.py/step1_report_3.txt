{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures, specifically case-insensitive dictionaries and a lookup dictionary, for use within the Requests library to handle HTTP headers and related data.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), data input during object creation, and method calls such as update(), __setitem__(), and __getitem__.",
  "sinks": "Accessing or modifying dictionary entries via __getitem__, __setitem__, or get() methods.",
  "flows": "Input data (from constructor or update) flows into internal storage (_store or __dict__) and is accessed or modified through methods like __getitem__, __setitem__, or copy().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard data structures and common method implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard dictionary-like classes with case-insensitive keys and a simple lookup dictionary. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or external data handling are present. The data structures rely on standard Python features, and all methods are typical for such classes. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of data structures supporting case-insensitive keys and lookup functionality, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
