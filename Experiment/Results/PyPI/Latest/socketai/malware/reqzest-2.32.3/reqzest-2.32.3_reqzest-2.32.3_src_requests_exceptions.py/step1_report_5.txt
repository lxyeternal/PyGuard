  "purpose": "Define exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the requests library.",
  "sources": "None; this code primarily defines classes and imports, without reading external input.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no sinks where untrusted data flows or data leaks occur.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks, as the code is class definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of standard exception class definitions and imports without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exceptions from urllib3 and compatibility modules, then defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions and other classes. Each class is documented and serves to categorize errors such as connection issues, timeouts, URL problems, and warnings related to the requests library. No code execution, data processing, or external data handling occurs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for a Python library’s exception handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains purely standard exception and warning class definitions for the requests library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to be a legitimate part of the library's error handling system.",
