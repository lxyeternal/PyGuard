{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for handling errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and a local compat module, class definitions that handle error cases and warnings.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data or untrusted input flows are present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code strictly defines exception classes without any external data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a hierarchy of exception and warning classes for the Requests library, importing exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules. It defines constructors for custom exceptions and handles pickling behavior. The code is structured as a standard error handling module, with no input/output operations, no data validation, or external code execution. It does not contain any signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The import of modules and class inheritance are typical for error handling. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for a Python HTTP library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears safe and straightforward.",
