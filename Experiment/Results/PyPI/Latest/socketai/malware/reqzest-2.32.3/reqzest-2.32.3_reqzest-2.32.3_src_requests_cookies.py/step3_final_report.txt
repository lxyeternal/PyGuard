  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for cookie management, including extraction, creation, merging, and header handling within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Request objects (headers, URL), response headers, cookie dictionaries, and request URLs.",
  "sinks": "CookieJar objects, request headers, and internal cookie data structures.",
  "flows": "Request data flows into cookie extraction and header generation; cookie data is stored, merged, or removed within CookieJar instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected. The code is straightforward and utility-focused.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management functionalities, including creating cookies, extracting cookies from responses, and manipulating cookie jars. It uses thread-safe mechanisms and provides compatibility interfaces. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows are present. The code operates solely on cookie data and request/response headers, with no network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured utility module for cookie handling in the requests library. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score reflects its utility nature and standard practices.",
