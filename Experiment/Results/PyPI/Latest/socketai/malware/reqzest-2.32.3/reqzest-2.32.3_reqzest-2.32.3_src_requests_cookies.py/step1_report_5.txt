  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility utilities for managing cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, and management functions for use with HTTP requests and responses.",
  "sources": "Reads include request URL and headers, response headers, and cookie attributes (name, value, domain, path, max-age, expires, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Generates Cookie header for requests, extracts cookies into CookieJar, and modifies or deletes cookies in the jar.",
  "flows": "Input data from request URLs, headers, and response headers flow into cookie extraction, creation, and storage functions; cookie data is used to generate headers for requests; cookie manipulations affect cookie jar contents.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code mainly implements cookie handling and compatibility features. No obfuscated code, suspicious network activity, or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for cookie management, including wrappers for request and response objects, cookie extraction, header generation, and cookie jar operations. It adheres to standard practices for cookie handling, converting cookies from cookies and Morsel objects, and providing dict-like interfaces. The functions for extracting cookies, creating cookies, and merging cookies are straightforward and do not perform any suspicious operations. No embedded or hidden code, external network connections, or data leaks are present. The implementation appears standard and intended for typical cookie management purposes within the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library. No malicious behavior or sabotage observed. It simply facilitates cookie management in HTTP transactions. Overall security risk is minimal.",
