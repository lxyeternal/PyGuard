  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as utility classes/functions for cookie management, reading request objects and response headers.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Cookies are added/removed via standard methods; data flows are typical.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no network activity, no malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe cookie management code.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No suspicious or malicious activity detected. The functions operate on well-defined data structures, and the code appears to be a standard implementation.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard cookie handling, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The functions are straightforward, and no suspicious flows are present.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confidence is 1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the utility nature, standard threading locks, no backdoors, no dynamic code, no network activity.\n- Highlights the code's compatibility and safe cookie handling.\n\n**Assessment:** Matches the code's behavior. No malicious patterns.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confidence = 0.9.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Describes the functions for cookie extraction, creation, and management.\n- No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- Focused on safe, standard cookie handling.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a utility module for cookie management, with no suspicious flows.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Confidence = 0.9.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing standard cookie handling, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The code's purpose is clear, benign, and aligns with standard practices.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (slightly higher due to minimal inherent complexity, but still very low). Confidence = 0.95.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports and the code itself show no signs of malicious behavior. The code handles cookies in a standard, safe manner without network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The code is utility code for cookie management, which by itself is low risk. The only minor concern is the potential for misuse if untrusted data is fed into it, but this is typical for such utilities and does not constitute a security risk.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minimal, inherent to cookie handling, but no vulnerabilities or malicious features)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-implemented cookie utility module for the requests library. It does not contain any malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final estimates:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2",
