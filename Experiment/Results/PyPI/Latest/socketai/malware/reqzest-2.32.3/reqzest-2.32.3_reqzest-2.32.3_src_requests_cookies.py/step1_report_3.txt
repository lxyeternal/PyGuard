{
  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and functions for handling cookies within the requests library, ensuring compatibility with http.cookiejar.CookieJar and enabling cookie management, extraction, and merging.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.internal_utils, .compat), standard libraries (calendar, copy, time, threading), and the request object passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "Functions that interact with cookie data such as extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header, remove_cookie_by_name, and cookie creation functions.",
  "flows": "Extraction of cookies from response headers to jar; creation of cookie objects; setting, deleting, and merging cookies within the jar; retrieval of cookies for request headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of threading.RLock for thread safety is standard. No unusual dynamic code execution, network activity, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides cookie management utilities for the requests library, including classes and functions to handle cookies securely and compatibly. Functions like extract_cookies_to_jar and get_cookie_header operate within expected boundaries. The cookie creation functions and jar methods follow standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or covert channels are present. Use of threading.RLock is appropriate for thread safety. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. Overall, this appears to be a standard, security-conscious implementation of cookie handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for cookie management in requests, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It adheres to expected patterns for handling cookies securely and compatibly, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
