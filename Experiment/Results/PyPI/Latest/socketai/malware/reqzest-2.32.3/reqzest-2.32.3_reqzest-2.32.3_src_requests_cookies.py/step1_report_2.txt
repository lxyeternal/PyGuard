  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies within the requests library, including classes and functions to manage, extract, create, and manipulate cookies and cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Reads data from request objects (e.g., request URL, headers) and cookie data (e.g., cookie name, value, domain, path) during cookie extraction, setting, and querying.",
  "sinks": "Modifies or accesses cookie headers, internal cookie store, and potentially reads cookie values for operations like setting or removing cookies.",
  "flows": "Input request data flows into cookie extraction functions; cookies are stored or retrieved via cookie jar methods; cookie headers are generated from cookie jars for outgoing requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code is primarily utility functions and classes for cookie management. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. Functions that modify or remove cookies are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code offers cookie management functionalities, including cookie extraction, creation, removal, and merging, with a focus on compatibility and convenience. All operations appear to be standard, well-documented, and do not contain any obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is observed. The functions operate on provided data structures and are intended for legitimate cookie handling in HTTP requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for cookie handling within the requests library. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It primarily facilitates cookie management and compatibility, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
