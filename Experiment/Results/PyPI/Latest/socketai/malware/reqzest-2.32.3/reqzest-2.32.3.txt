No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.2-0.3) are appropriate and justified."

The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal, around 0.0 to 0.1. For clarity, setting the security risk score to 0 would be appropriate, but the current low score is acceptable."

      "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility shim that manipulates sys.modules to alias modules under the 'requests.packages' namespace. It does not contain malicious activity or backdoors. The low security risk stems from the fact that sys.modules manipulation could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but as implemented, it is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal but potential risk in an untrusted environment."
