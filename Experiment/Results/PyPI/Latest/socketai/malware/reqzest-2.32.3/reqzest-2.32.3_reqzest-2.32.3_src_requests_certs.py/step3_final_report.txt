{
  "purpose": "Outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package, serving as an informational utility.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only prints the CA bundle path, which is benign.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' -> print(where()) when executed as main.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted function to locate the CA bundle and prints its path. It contains no user input, network activity, or data leaks. The code is simple, well-structured, and performs a benign task. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The purpose appears to be for debugging or configuration validation. All security signals indicate no risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that reports the CA bundle location. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
