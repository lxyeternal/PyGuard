{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA bundle used for SSL verification, primarily leveraging the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the import 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code prints the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The source (certifi.where) provides the path, which is then printed as output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior. It simply exposes the CA bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the certifi package, which returns the path to the trusted CA certificates bundle. When executed directly, it prints this path. No user input or external data sources are involved. The code performs a simple informational function without any malicious intent. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious code patterns. The logic is clear, and the purpose aligns with typical SSL configuration routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, functioning solely to output the default CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
