{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the requests library, mainly for verifying SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location using the 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' outputs the CA bundle path, which could be used downstream in SSL verification but does not directly introduce security risks.",
  "flows": "Input: None; Output: The CA bundle path printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward use of a standard library function. No obfuscated or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' to retrieve the path to the trusted CA bundle. It simply prints this path when executed as the main module. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no network activity or sensitive data handling. The code functions as a utility for confirming the CA bundle location, which is typical in security-sensitive applications. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script that outputs the path to the default CA bundle used for SSL verification. It contains no malicious code or security vulnerabilities.",
