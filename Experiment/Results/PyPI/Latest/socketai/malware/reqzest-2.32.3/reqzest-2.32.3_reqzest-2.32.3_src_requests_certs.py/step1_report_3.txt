  "purpose": "Provide the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'where' from certifi; usage of 'where()' function in main block.",
  "sinks": "Output of 'where()' function to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' from certifi -> Call 'where()' -> Print result.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscation; straightforward usage of a known, reputable library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'where' from the certifi package, which is a standard, trusted library for SSL certificates. It simply prints the default CA bundle location when run directly. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious commands, or suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose is to inform the user of the CA bundle location and does not involve any data leakage, network activity, or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, designed solely to output the path of the default CA bundle. It uses standard libraries and practices with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
