{
  "purpose": "This module provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the import 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs the CA bundle path to stdout via print(), which is not inherently unsafe.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from certifi and then prints its value, allowing external scripts or users to access the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs; the code is straightforward and relies on a standard package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from certifi to determine the default CA bundle location. When run as a script, it simply prints this path. There are no input handling, no network operations, no environment variable misuse, and no cryptic or obfuscated code. The code is simple and serves a legitimate purpose related to SSL certificate verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a utility to expose the default CA bundle path from certifi. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues.",
