  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Module-level assignments of metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data processing, network, or external interaction occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; all code consists of straightforward string and integer assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely descriptive metadata for the 'requests' package, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The content is typical for package setup or metadata files. There is no obfuscation or hidden code; the variables are assigned static values clearly intended for package information.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign and only provides metadata about the 'requests' package. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security risks. The code appears to be a standard package metadata declaration.",
