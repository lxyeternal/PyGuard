  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright information.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no output or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment of package info.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art and emojis; no suspicious or malicious code observed. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code solely assigns metadata variables.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string assignments setting package metadata variables such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc. The ASCII art at the beginning appears to be decorative and does not affect execution. No input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata declaration for the 'requests' library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
