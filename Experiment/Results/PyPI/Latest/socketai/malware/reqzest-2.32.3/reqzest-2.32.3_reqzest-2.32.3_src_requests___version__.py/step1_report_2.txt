  "purpose": "This code defines metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including its title, description, URL, version, author information, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; the code only assigns static string and integer values to variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink operations such as network communication, file writing, or data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all data are static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard metadata declaration with no unusual or suspicious constructs. The decorative comment does not influence execution.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns predefined metadata strings and values to module-level variables, typical for Python package initialization files. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or potentially malicious logic is present. The metadata aligns with publicly available information about the 'requests' library. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
