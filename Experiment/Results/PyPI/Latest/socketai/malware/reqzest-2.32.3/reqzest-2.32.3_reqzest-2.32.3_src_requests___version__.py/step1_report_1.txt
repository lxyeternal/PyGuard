  "purpose": "Define metadata for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, build, author, email, license, copyright, and a decorative emoji string.",
  "sources": "Module-level string assignments for metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations; no sinks indicating data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static strings to module variables; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is purely metadata definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments providing package metadata. No input/output, no external data fetching, no code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The comments and metadata are standard for a Python package. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The presence of emojis is purely decorative and not suspicious. Overall, this appears to be benign documentation code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign metadata for the 'requests' package with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard package info and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
