{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility utilities and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies like urllib3 and chardet.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib, and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communications; no network or file I/O operations are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "This code primarily initializes modules and variables; there are no active data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code is straightforward, with standard compatibility handling and module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks, dynamic module importing, and defines compatibility variables and functions. It carefully attempts to import optional modules like simplejson and chardet without revealing sensitive information or executing untrusted code. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All operations are standard for maintaining compatibility across different Python versions. The code does not interact with external systems or handle user input.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for compatibility and dependency management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for a compatibility layer in a Python package.",
