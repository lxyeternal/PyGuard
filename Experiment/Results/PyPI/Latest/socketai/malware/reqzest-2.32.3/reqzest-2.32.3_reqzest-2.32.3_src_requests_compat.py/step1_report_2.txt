{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility support for different Python versions and handle dependencies such as urllib3, chardet, and simplejson.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external libraries (urllib3, chardet, simplejson, urllib.parse, urllib.request), sys.version_info for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and assigns variables; no data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard compatibility and import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs import operations and version detection, which are standard for maintaining backward compatibility. It uses try-except blocks for safe imports, and the logic appears straightforward. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code handles optional dependencies and compatibility logic without executing untrusted code or handling external input unsafely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility and dependency import module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions solely to support various Python environments and handle optional dependencies safely.",
