{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and manages imports for various libraries such as urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, and JSON modules.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from urllib3, imports libraries like importlib, sys, and various standard library modules, attempts to import 'simplejson' or defaults to 'json'.",
  "sinks": "Uses imported modules for parsing URLs, encoding/decoding strings, and handling JSON data, but no direct untrusted input processing or data output sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignments are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are observable. Version info and module imports are static, with no user input or network data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated logic, or suspicious dynamic code execution. It primarily handles compatibility and module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility and import utility module, handling Python version differences and optional dependencies such as 'simplejson' and character detection libraries. It includes version checks, module import attempts, and standard library references. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. It does not process untrusted input or perform any network or file operations beyond standard imports. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focusing on compatibility and dependency resolution without any malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or data leaks. Overall, it is a standard utility module for compatibility.",
