{
  "purpose": "Provide compatibility and utility functions for HTTP requests, character detection, and Python version handling in a Python 2 and 3 compatible environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, collections, http, io, urllib), dynamic module imports for 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', optional import of 'simplejson'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows to critical functions or system calls. The code mainly imports modules and defines utility functions without executing untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code dynamically imports character detection libraries and JSON parsing modules, but these are standard practices. There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs version checks, conditional imports, and compatibility handling. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up environment compatibility for different Python versions and optional modules, handles import errors gracefully, and defines some utility functions and constants. It imports standard libraries and modules with well-known functions, with no indications of malicious intent. The dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer' is standard for character encoding detection. The conditional import of 'simplejson' is also a common pattern to support JSON parsing. No external or untrusted data sources are accessed or used in a way that could cause harm. The code does not execute any user input, nor does it contain suspicious network connections or file operations beyond standard library usage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a compatibility and utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs environment detection, module imports, and setup tasks typical of supporting libraries. There are no anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious indicators identified.",
