{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies like urllib3, chardet, and json.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (sys.version_info), attempts to import external libraries (chardet, simplejson), and loads various standard library modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions. The code mainly performs imports and version checks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and imported modules, but there are no untrusted data inputs or network communications in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is mostly straightforward and standard for compatibility layers. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version checks, dynamic imports, and conditional imports based on availability, which are standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. No data is processed in an insecure manner, and no malicious functions are evident. The code does not include network operations or data handling that could be exploited. Overall, it appears to be a benign compatibility shim with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical compatibility module without malicious behavior. It performs version checks, imports libraries, and defines some compatibility aliases. No security risks or malware are detected.",
