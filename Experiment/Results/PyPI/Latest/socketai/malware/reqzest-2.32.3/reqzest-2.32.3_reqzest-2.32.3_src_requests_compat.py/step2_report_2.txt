  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a compatibility layer with no malicious intent. It performs version checks, imports, and defines aliases. No data leakage, network activity, or malicious functions are present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- The securityRisk score of 0.1 might be slightly high given the benign nature, but since it involves dynamic imports and version checks, a very low risk score could be justified.  \n- Overall, the conclusion is correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it emphasizes compatibility, safe imports, and no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident.  \n- The securityRisk score of 0 aligns with the benign description.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility and dependency management, with no external communication or data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious indicators or security issues are present.  \n- The code's purpose is purely for compatibility.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility utilities, no untrusted data handling, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- The code is standard for such utility modules.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Compatibility and dependency management, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- The code is straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a benign compatibility layer with no malicious intent. The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature. The securityRisk scores are minimal, reflecting the low risk associated with such code.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 across all reports.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.  \n**Risk score:** Given the nature of the code, a maximum of 0.1 seems reasonable; some reports already have 0 or 0.1, which aligns with the low-risk assessment.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (reflecting the dynamic imports and version checks but no actual security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the benign, compatibility-focused nature of the code. No modifications are necessary.",
