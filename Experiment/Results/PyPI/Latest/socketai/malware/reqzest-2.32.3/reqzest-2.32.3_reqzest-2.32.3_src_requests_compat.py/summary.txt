  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal, around 0.0 to 0.1. For clarity, setting the security risk score to 0 would be appropriate, but the current low score is acceptable."
