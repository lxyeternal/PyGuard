  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version info retrieval, dynamic import attempts for optional libraries.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Version detection and conditional imports, with no external data or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward dependency management and version checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility functions: detecting Python version, importing optional modules like chardet and simplejson, and defining aliases. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The logic is clear, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal, around 0.0 to 0.1. For clarity, setting the security risk score to 0 would be appropriate, but the current low score is acceptable.",
