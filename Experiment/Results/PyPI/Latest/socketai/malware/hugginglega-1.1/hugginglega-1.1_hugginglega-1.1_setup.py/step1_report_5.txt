  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'hugginglega' Python package, used to define package metadata and prepare for installation.",
  "sources": "The import of setuptools module and the setup() function call with package name and version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the standard 'setuptools' library and calls the setup() function with static values for 'name' and 'version'. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. It appears to be a minimal, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
