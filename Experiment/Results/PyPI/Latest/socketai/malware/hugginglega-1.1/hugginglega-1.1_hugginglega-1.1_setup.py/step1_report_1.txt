{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the Python module 'hugginglega'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'setuptools' module and uses it to configure package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; the code only sets package information.",
  "flows": "Imports 'setuptools' -> calls 'setuptools.setup()' with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard 'setuptools' library, which is commonly used for Python package distribution. It then calls 'setuptools.setup()' with fixed values for 'name' and 'version'. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data handling. The setup configuration appears straightforward and typical for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
