  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'hugginglega'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, specifically 'name' and 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data leakage or malicious effect points evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to sink; the code only initializes package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with package name and version. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for packaging, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious payload. It does not contain any dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or network activity. The simplicity and standard structure suggest benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
