  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'hugginglega' with static name and version.",
  "sources": "Import of 'setuptools' library, static parameters 'name' and 'version' in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external inputs, or outputs.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' -> call to 'setuptools.setup()' with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, minimal, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard 'setuptools' library and calls 'setup()' with fixed parameters. No dynamic code, external inputs, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, typical setup script. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The package name 'hugginglega' resembles known packages but does not imply malicious activity in the static code. The code's structure and content are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
