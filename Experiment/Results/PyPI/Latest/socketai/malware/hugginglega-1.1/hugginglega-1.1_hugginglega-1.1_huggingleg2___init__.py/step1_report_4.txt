{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import the 'transformers' library and, if successful, executes a system command to fetch and run a script from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The importlib.import_module('transformers') call; the os.system() command with a curl request to a remote IP address.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing a shell command with remote content piped directly into sh, which can execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "If the 'transformers' library is installed, the code flows from the import check to executing the remote script via os.system().",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with a remote URL piped into sh indicates potential malicious intent; executing code fetched from an external IP address is highly suspicious. The IP address is hardcoded and not related to the library's typical usage.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by trying to import the 'transformers' library. If the library is present, it then executes a shell command that fetches content from a specific IP address and pipes it directly into 'sh' for execution. This behavior resembles executing remote code, which is a significant security concern. The use of try-except only for import failure does not mitigate the risk of executing malicious code if the library exists. The remote URL's IP address and the command's nature are typical indicators of malicious activity, such as remote code execution or a backdoor. No other benign purpose is evident in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains highly suspicious behavior, specifically executing remotely fetched code via a hardcoded IP address when a certain library is present. This indicates malicious intent or a security compromise. It should be considered malicious, with high security risk.",
