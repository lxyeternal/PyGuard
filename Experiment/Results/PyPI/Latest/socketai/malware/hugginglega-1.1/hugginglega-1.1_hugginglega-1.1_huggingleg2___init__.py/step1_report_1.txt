  "purpose": "Attempt to dynamically import the 'transformers' library and execute a system command that fetches and executes a script from a remote IP address.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'transformers' module; subprocess call via os.system with a curl command to fetch a remote file.",
  "sinks": "os.system executing remote script fetched via curl command; the remote script is executed in the shell.",
  "flows": "Import attempt triggers the remote script execution via curl command if 'transformers' is installed.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of a remote script from an IP address using curl piped directly to sh without validation; hardcoded IP address; use of os.system for remote code execution; no validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import the 'transformers' library, and if successful, it runs a shell command that fetches a script from a hardcoded IP address and executes it with sh. This behavior indicates an attempt to run remote code, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of os.system with a remote URL piped directly into sh is dangerous, as it allows remote code execution without any validation or security checks. The presence of the IP address and the direct execution pattern strongly suggest malicious intent or a backdoor mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk malicious behavior by executing remote code from an external IP address, likely for malicious purposes. It is a security threat and should be considered compromised or dangerous.",
