  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata for a Python package named 'certifications' with suspicious attributes such as an extremely high version number and a description explicitly stating 'Malicious backdoor package'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including 'name', 'version', 'author', 'author_email', and 'description'.",
  "sinks": "There are no runtime data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code is static metadata only.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution paths; the code only declares static package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious metadata: high version number '999.999.999', description explicitly indicating malicious intent, and author email 'attacker@example.com'. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious payloads or executable malicious code. The suspicious elements are solely in the metadata, which could be used deceptively. The description explicitly states 'Malicious backdoor package,' and the version number is unnaturally high, both indicators of malicious intent or deception. However, without embedded malicious code or network activity, the actual malware risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports vary, often overestimating risk based on metadata alone. Given the absence of active malicious code, the malware score should be very low (around 0.1), and the security risk should be moderate (around 0.3). The obfuscated score remains 0, as the code is straightforward. Overall, the package's maliciousness is implied by metadata, not by code behavior, so the risk is primarily potential deception rather than active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but suspicious due to its metadata indicating malicious intent. No active malicious payloads are present. The high malware and risk scores in the reports are inflated; they should be lowered to reflect the absence of active malicious code. The package's metadata suggests malicious intent, but without embedded payloads, the actual threat level is low. The scores should be adjusted to malware: 0.1, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.3, aligning with the evidence that this is metadata-driven suspicion rather than active malware.",
