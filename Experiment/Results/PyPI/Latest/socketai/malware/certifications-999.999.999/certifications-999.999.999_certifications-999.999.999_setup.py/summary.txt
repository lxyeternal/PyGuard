  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but suspicious due to its metadata indicating malicious intent. No active malicious payloads are present. The high malware and risk scores in the reports are inflated; they should be lowered to reflect the absence of active malicious code. The package's metadata suggests malicious intent, but without embedded payloads, the actual threat level is low. The scores should be adjusted to malware: 0.1, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.3, aligning with the evidence that this is metadata-driven suspicion rather than active malware."
