  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, scores, and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code **immediately executes a `requests.get()` to a hardcoded external URL** (`http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue`) at import time.\n- During the package installation, the custom `PostInstallCommand` also calls `post_install()`, which repeats the same request.\n- No validation, encryption, or user control over these requests.\n- The URL appears suspicious, and the repeated external contact is unusual for legitimate setup scripts.\n- The reports assign high malware and security risk scores (~0.75–0.9), which seem justified given the behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Yes, the code makes external network requests at import and during install, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No coding errors, but the design pattern (immediate network contact) is problematic from a security perspective.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: Ranges from 0.7 to 0.9 — justified, as this pattern can be used for data exfiltration or command-and-control.\n  - Security risk: Also high (~0.75–0.8), justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Claims based on assumptions:** The reports reasonably assume malicious intent due to the pattern of external contact, which is standard in malicious code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; immediate external request and during install are suspicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0.75, security risk 0.8 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid concerns; high suspicion of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Well-reasoned; external contact at import and install.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0.75, security risk 0.75 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Suspicious, potentially malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Similar pattern; repeated external requests.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0.7, security risk 0.75 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Suspicious, warrants caution.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern; external request at import and during install.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0.9, security risk 0.9 — justified given the high suspicion.\n- **Conclusion:** Strongly indicates malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern; external contact at import and during install.\n- **Score justification:** Malware 0.4, security risk 0.6 — slightly lower, but still suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Still suspicious, but perhaps less malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations:\n\n- The core behavior (immediate and post-install external requests) is **highly suspicious** and **potentially malicious**.\n- The **malware scores** are appropriate, reflecting the risk of data exfiltration or command-and-control.\n- The **security risk scores** are also justified, given the behavior.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.8** — consistent with the reports and behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.8** — high due to repeated external contact during setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports correctly identify the suspicious pattern of external network requests during import and installation. The scores are reasonable and justified. The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious or at least highly suspicious packages, especially in supply chain contexts.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Treat this package as potentially malicious; further investigation or outright rejection is advised unless the external request serves a legitimate purpose and is properly secured.",
