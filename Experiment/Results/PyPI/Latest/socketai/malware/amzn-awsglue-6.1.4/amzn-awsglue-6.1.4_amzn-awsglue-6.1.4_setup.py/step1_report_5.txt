  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that performs an HTTP GET request during installation.",
  "sources": "The GET request to http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue executed at the module level and within the post_install() function called during installation.",
  "sinks": "The external server at pov.sh:45111 that receives the HTTP request; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The script makes an immediate GET request upon module import, and again during the custom post-install step, sending data to an external server without any validation or user input.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes an HTTP request to an external server at module load time, which is atypical for a standard setup script; the request is duplicated during installation, possibly for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and the 'requests' library, then makes an external HTTP GET request immediately upon import, which is unusual for setup scripts and could be used for tracking or malicious activity. The custom install command also makes the same request during package installation, further suggesting potential malicious behavior such as unauthorized data collection or system fingerprinting. No hardcoded credentials are present. The setup process appears standard apart from the network activity. The code does not include obfuscation or malicious payloads like system damage, data theft, or reverse shells.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an external network request during both import and installation phases, which could be used for tracking, user fingerprinting, or malicious data exfiltration. The repeated requests and the lack of clear benign purpose suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior, especially in a supply chain context.",
