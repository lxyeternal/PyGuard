{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a post-installation step which makes an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network via requests.get() calls, specifically to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue'. It also reads 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The external requests could send data to the server, but there are no explicit sinks that leak data within the code itself. The main concern is the outgoing network request which could be used for malicious communication.",
  "flows": "The code executes requests.get() at the top level and again in the post_install() function during installation, both of which send HTTP GET requests to an external server. The flow is from the source (network request) to the external server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an outbound request to an external domain ('pov.sh:45111') during module load and post-install, which is unusual for a setup script. There are no credentials or sensitive data hardcoded, but the repeated network calls during installation could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and 'requests'. It immediately performs an HTTP GET request to an external server upon import, which is atypical and suspicious. It also defines a post-install function that repeats this request during package installation, possibly for command-and-control or data exfiltration. The setup() function specifies a custom install command that executes this post-install behavior. There are no obfuscated parts or dynamic code execution. The external communication occurs both at import time and during installation, indicating potential malicious intent such as establishing contact with a command server or tracking installation activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized external network communication both at import and installation stages, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The repeated contact to an external server during setup suggests possible malicious behavior or covert communication channels. Overall, this package exhibits high-risk behavior due to its external network activity during setup.",
