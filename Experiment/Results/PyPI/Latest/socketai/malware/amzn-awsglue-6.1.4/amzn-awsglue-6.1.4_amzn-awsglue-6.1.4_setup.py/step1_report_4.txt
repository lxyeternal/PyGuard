{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'amzn-awsglue' with custom post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue' during import and within the post-install function.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data to an external server without validation, potentially leaking information or executing malicious code if the server responds maliciously.",
  "flows": "Code execution flows from importing requests to executing the GET request immediately, and again during the post-install command, sending data to the external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes making an external request at import time and during installation without any apparent user prompt or configuration, indicating potential tracking or malicious activity. The URL used ('pov.sh') is suspicious and suggests malicious intent or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'requests' and performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external server both immediately upon import and during the post-installation process. The request occurs without any input validation, user consent, or purpose explanation, which is unusual for a setup script. Overriding the install command to include network activity is a common technique for malicious payload delivery or data exfiltration. The setup metadata appears normal, but the embedded network request is suspicious and indicates potential malicious behavior. There are no other malicious code patterns like code injection, backdoors, or data theft beyond the suspicious external request.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a suspicious external request during both import and installation phases, likely intended for data exfiltration or malicious tracking. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests malicious intent, possibly to spy on or communicate with a malicious server. The package should be considered unsafe for use.",
