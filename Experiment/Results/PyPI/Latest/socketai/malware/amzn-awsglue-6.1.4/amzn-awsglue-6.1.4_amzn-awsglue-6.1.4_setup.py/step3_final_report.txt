{
  "purpose": "The code makes external HTTP GET requests to a suspicious server both at import time and during package installation, likely for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, command-and-control, or tracking.",
  "sources": "The top-level 'requests.get' call at import, and the 'requests.get' call within the 'post_install()' function invoked during setup.",
  "sinks": "External server at 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-awsglue' receiving data, potential for data leakage or command-and-control communication.",
  "flows": "Code executes 'requests.get' during import and during installation, sending data to the external server without validation or user control.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate external network requests at import time and during setup, hardcoded suspicious URL, no validation or encryption, unprompted contact with external server.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unsolicited external HTTP requests at import and during installation phases, which is atypical and suspicious for a setup script. The URL is suspicious and indicates potential malicious activity. The pattern of external contact without user consent or validation is characteristic of malware or tracking tools. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, but the behavior itself is a red flag. The high confidence scores (~0.8-0.9) assigned by the reports are justified given the pattern, and the malware score (~0.8-0.9) reflects the potential for malicious activity. The security risk is similarly high (~0.8-0.9), indicating a significant threat if used in supply chains.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk suspicious behavior through repeated external contact during import and setup, indicative of malicious or tracking activity. The scores assigned are appropriate; the package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious, warranting further investigation or rejection.",
