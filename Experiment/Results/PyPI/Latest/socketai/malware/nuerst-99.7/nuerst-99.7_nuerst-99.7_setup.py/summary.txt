  "conclusion": "The package executes 'main()' from an external module during installation without validation, posing a high security risk. This pattern can be exploited for supply chain attacks or malicious code execution. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores, and such packages should be reviewed thoroughly or avoided unless the execution is explicitly justified and verified safe."
