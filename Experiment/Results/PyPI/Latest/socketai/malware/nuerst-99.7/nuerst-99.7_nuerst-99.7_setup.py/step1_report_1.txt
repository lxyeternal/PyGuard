  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation step to execute code from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' and execution of 'main()' within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' which could potentially contain malicious code if 'main' is compromised or malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method imports 'main' and calls 'main()', creating a source-to-sink path.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes arbitrary code ('main()') unconditionally during installation; no validation or security checks are performed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with minimal dependencies. It uses a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method. After standard installation, it imports and executes 'main()' from 'main.py' without any validation, sandboxing, or security checks. This is unusual and potentially dangerous because it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The 'main' module could contain malicious code, leading to security risks. No obfuscation or suspicious dependencies are present, but the execution of external code at install time is a significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes code from 'main.py' during installation without validation, which poses a security risk. This pattern can be exploited if 'main.py' is malicious or compromised, making this package potentially dangerous to install. It should be reviewed further or avoided until the purpose of executing 'main()' is verified as safe.",
