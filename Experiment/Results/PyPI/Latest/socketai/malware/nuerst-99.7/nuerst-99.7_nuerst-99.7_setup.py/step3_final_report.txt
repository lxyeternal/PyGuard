  "purpose": "The setup script executes 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation via a custom install class, which can run arbitrary code at install time.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' and calling 'main()' within the 'run()' method of the custom 'CrazyInstallStrat' class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code flow is: setup() -> CrazyInstallStrat.run() -> import main -> main() execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code ('main()') during package installation without validation or sandboxing; pattern is highly unusual and risky.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during the run phase, imports and executes 'main()' from 'main.py'. This pattern executes arbitrary code during package installation, which is a significant security concern. No validation, sanitization, or sandboxing is performed before executing 'main()'. The pattern resembles supply chain attack vectors, allowing malicious code in 'main.py' to run with the permissions of the installer. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the behavior itself is suspicious and potentially malicious. The potential for malicious activity justifies high malware and security risk scores. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, but given the high severity of executing external code during install, they could be slightly increased.",
  "conclusion": "The package executes 'main()' from an external module during installation without validation, posing a high security risk. This pattern can be exploited for supply chain attacks or malicious code execution. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores, and such packages should be reviewed thoroughly or avoided unless the execution is explicitly justified and verified safe.",
