      "conclusion": "The package executes 'main()' from an external module during installation without validation, posing a high security risk. This pattern can be exploited for supply chain attacks or malicious code execution. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores, and such packages should be reviewed thoroughly or avoided unless the execution is explicitly justified and verified safe."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. Its behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious, justifying high malware (~0.75) and security risk (~0.75) scores. The code should be treated with caution and possibly blocked or further analyzed for intent."
