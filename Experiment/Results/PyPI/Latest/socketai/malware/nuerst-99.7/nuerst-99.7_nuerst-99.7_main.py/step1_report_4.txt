  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), current user (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system data embedded as URL parameters using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, user, path, random number) from sources are encoded into URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Multiple suspicious URLs that do not appear to be legitimate; data exfiltration pattern; use of random number as a URL parameter; no clear legitimate purpose for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system info and generates a random number, then sends this data to several external URLs. These URLs are suspicious, as they do not correspond to known services and may be used to track or exfiltrate user data. The data is sent unencrypted via GET requests, which is insecure and suggests possible malicious intent. The code does not perform any validation or obfuscation, and the presence of multiple URLs aimed at different domains indicates an attempt at covert data collection. There are no signs of obfuscation or benign purpose; the pattern resembles malicious data harvesting or a command-and-control communication attempt.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears designed to collect system information and transmit it to suspicious external servers, which could be part of malicious tracking or data exfiltration activities. The URLs involved are suspicious, and the data transmission pattern raises security concerns. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent with high likelihood.",
