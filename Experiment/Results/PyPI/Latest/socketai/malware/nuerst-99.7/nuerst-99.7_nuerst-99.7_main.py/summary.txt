  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. Its behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious, justifying high malware (~0.75) and security risk (~0.75) scores. The code should be treated with caution and possibly blocked or further analyzed for intent."
