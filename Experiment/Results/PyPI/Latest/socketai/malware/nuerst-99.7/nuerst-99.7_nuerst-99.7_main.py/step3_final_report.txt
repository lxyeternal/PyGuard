{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with query parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and random number) flow into URL construction, which then flows into network requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious URLs with 'oast' domains, unencrypted data transmission, no user consent or validation, and no obfuscation or malicious payloads",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly gathers system info and transmits it to external servers without encryption or user approval. The URLs are suspicious, indicating potential tracking or exfiltration. No malicious code execution or obfuscation is present. The data flow is simple and direct, with no validation or security measures. The behavior suggests covert data collection, which is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious depending on context. The malware score should reflect high suspicion due to data exfiltration, but not active malicious payloads. The security risk is high because of privacy invasion and untrusted external communication. The code's behavior aligns with malicious tracking scripts, warranting a high malware and security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. Its behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious, justifying high malware (~0.75) and security risk (~0.75) scores. The code should be treated with caution and possibly blocked or further analyzed for intent.",
