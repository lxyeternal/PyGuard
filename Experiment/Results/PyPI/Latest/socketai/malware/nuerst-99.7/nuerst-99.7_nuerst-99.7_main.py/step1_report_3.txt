  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, current path, random number) encoded into URL parameters and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with non-descriptive domain names, sending system info to external servers without clear purpose, inclusion of random number for request uniqueness, no user consent or explicit purpose evident",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to external domains, which appear suspicious and potentially malicious. The domains are obscure and could be used for data exfiltration or malicious tracking. The use of try-except for network requests is typical, but the behavior of transmitting system info silently to external servers is suspicious. No other malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated parts are present. Overall, the code appears designed to gather and transmit system info covertly, indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script silently collects and transmits system information to external servers, which is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicative of a data exfiltration or tracking activity. The code’s behavior warrants concern, especially given the obscure URLs and lack of user consent.",
