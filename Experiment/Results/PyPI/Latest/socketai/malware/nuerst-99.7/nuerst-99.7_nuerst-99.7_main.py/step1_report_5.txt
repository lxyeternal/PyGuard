  "purpose": "The code collects system information and sends it to external URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, username, and current working directory from the system; generates a random number.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs with embedded system info and a random number as parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects system info (hostname, user, path) -> encodes as URL parameters -> sends via HTTP GET request to multiple external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of suspicious URLs with 'oast' domains, which are often used in security testing or tracking. Sends system info without any user consent or encryption. No validation or sanitization of data before transmission.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system info such as hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number and constructs URLs with this data, then attempts to fetch each URL, logging responses or errors. The URLs are unusual and appear to be designed for tracking or data collection purposes. No user input is involved; data is systematically sent to third-party domains. The code does not perform any malicious system modification, but the pattern of collecting and transmitting system info to suspicious domains raises security concerns. The purpose appears to be tracking or profiling, potentially malicious if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely designed for tracking or data exfiltration, collecting system info and sending it to external servers without user awareness. It does not contain active malicious payloads like code execution or backdoors but exhibits behavior typical of spyware or tracking scripts. The URLs used are suspicious and indicate potential privacy violations or malicious intent.",
