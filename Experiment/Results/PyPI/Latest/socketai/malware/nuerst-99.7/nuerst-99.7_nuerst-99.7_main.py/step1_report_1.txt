  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs for tracking or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests with collected data as URL parameters to external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System information and a random number are collected, encoded as URL parameters, and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious URLs with oast or malicious-looking domains; sends system data to these URLs; employs a random number in URL path which could be used for tracking or command-and-control communication. No user input is directly used, but data is sent externally.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific data (hostname, username, current directory) and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious or potentially malicious domains, appending collected data as URL parameters. The requests are sent via urllib without any validation or authentication, potentially for tracking, profiling, or exfiltration. The code does not perform malicious actions like modifying files, executing commands, or connecting to malicious domains actively, but it leaks system info to external servers, which could be used maliciously. The URLs appear to be part of an external monitoring or testing infrastructure, suggesting possible malicious intent or at least privacy invasion. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively transmits system information to external URLs, indicating potential privacy violations or malicious monitoring. While it does not execute harmful actions directly, its behavior of leaking system data to suspicious domains warrants caution. It appears designed for tracking or exfiltration rather than legitimate functionality.",
