  "conclusion": "The obfuscated eval() pattern in 'deinit()' is a red flag for malicious activity. The high obfuscation and malware scores are justified, and the code should be fully decoded and examined before trusting or deploying. The overall security risk is very high due to the potential for hidden malicious payloads."
