{
  "purpose": "Provides Windows console control functions such as setting colors, styles, cursor position, clearing screen, and enabling VT processing for ANSI sequences.",
  "sources": "Reads from file descriptors via get_osfhandle; interacts with win32 API functions for console manipulation.",
  "sinks": "Calls into system APIs to modify console attributes, cursor, and buffer; no untrusted data processed into system calls.",
  "flows": "System calls for console info and mode setting; no data flows from untrusted sources into critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard API usage with proper error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Windows console management library, utilizing standard API calls for styling, cursor control, screen clearing, and enabling VT sequences. It handles errors gracefully and does not process untrusted input maliciously. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The enabling of VT processing is a legitimate feature, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, legitimate Windows console utility library with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's functionality.",
