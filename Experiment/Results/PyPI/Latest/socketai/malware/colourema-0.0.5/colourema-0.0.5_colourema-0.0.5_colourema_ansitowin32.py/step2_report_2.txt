  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code handles ANSI escape sequences, converting them to Windows API calls or stripping them, depending on environment support.\n- It wraps output streams like sys.stdout and sys.stderr.\n- It interacts with Windows-specific APIs for terminal control.\n- No network, file, or credential operations are present.\n- Regex patterns and environment checks are standard.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code structures are evident.\n- The purpose is clearly to provide terminal formatting and compatibility, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate; matches the code's functionality.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard terminal handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate terminal formatting utility, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.0\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk and malware score are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct; describes regex parsing and conversion.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; standard environment checks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate cross-platform ANSI handling code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate; focuses on stream wrapping and ANSI parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious behavior; straightforward terminal handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate low scores.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct; emphasizes ANSI sequence management.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns; standard terminal utility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe code.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate; similar to others.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious activity; standard API usage.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid terminal handling library.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All low, reflecting the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, mainly environment and API interactions typical for terminal handling)\n\n**Note:** The code is a well-structured terminal formatting utility, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's functionality. No adjustments are necessary.",
