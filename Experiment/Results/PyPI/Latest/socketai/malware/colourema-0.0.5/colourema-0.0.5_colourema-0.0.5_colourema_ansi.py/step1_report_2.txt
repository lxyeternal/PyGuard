  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor control.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources are read; all data is predefined or passed as parameters within functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data for effects; functions generate control sequences based solely on provided parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like 'title', 'n', 'x', 'y' flow into functions that generate escape sequences; no data is propagated from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code strictly defines constants and functions for terminal control sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movement. The functions and classes only generate control sequences based on provided parameters or class attributes. There is no input validation or external data processing that could lead to code injection or malicious behavior. The class constructors dynamically assign escape sequences to instance attributes but only use static, predefined class attributes. No network activity, file I/O, or system modifications are present. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for terminal output formatting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply maps predefined constants to escape sequences and provides functions for cursor movement and screen clearing. No external data sources, sinks, or unsafe operations are identified.",
