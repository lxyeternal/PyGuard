  "purpose": "Utility module for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, cursor control, and screen management.",
  "sources": "Predefined constants, function parameters (code, title, mode, x, y), class attributes",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., code, title, mode, x, y) are concatenated with escape sequence strings to produce control codes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code provides static and parameterized functions/classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It relies solely on predefined constants and input parameters, with no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The logic is simple string concatenation, and the purpose is purely to facilitate terminal display formatting. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature and straightforward implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented utility for ANSI escape sequences with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
