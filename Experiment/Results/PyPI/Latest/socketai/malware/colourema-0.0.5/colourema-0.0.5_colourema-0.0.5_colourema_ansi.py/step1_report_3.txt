{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data to external systems or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily defines constants and simple functions for generating ANSI codes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal output. The functions `code_to_chars`, `set_title`, `clear_screen`, and `clear_line` generate control sequences based on input parameters. The classes `AnsiCodes`, `AnsiCursor`, `AnsiFore`, `AnsiBack`, and `AnsiStyle` define color and style codes as class attributes, initialized with escape sequences upon instantiation. All code constructs are standard, with no external data reading, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The implementation appears straightforward and safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for terminal text formatting with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Its purpose is to generate ANSI escape sequences for styling terminal output, and it does so in a standard manner.",
