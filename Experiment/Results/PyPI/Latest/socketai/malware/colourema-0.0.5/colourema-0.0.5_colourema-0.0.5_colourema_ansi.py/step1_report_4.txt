  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate ANSI escape sequences for coloring and formatting terminal output, including setting text color, background, styles, and cursor positioning.",
  "sources": "Definitions of color codes, style codes, cursor position functions, and functions generating escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Generation of escape sequences which are returned as strings; these strings are intended to be printed to terminals to affect visual output. No untrusted data handling or output to external systems is present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, cursor positions) flow into functions that generate escape sequence strings, which are then returned for printing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward, with functions returning formatted strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and functions for creating ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting. It includes classes for foreground and background colors, styles, and cursor movements, which instantiate with predefined codes. The class initializers convert numeric codes into escape sequences, but do not execute or evaluate untrusted input. The code relies on fixed, well-known ANSI codes and simple string concatenation. No code injection, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate terminal display styling, and there are no suspicious behaviors or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. Its structure and content are typical for such a utility module, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks.",
