  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully, cross-referencing the code and the assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It provides constants, functions, and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting (colors, styles, cursor control).\n- No external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- All functions and classes rely on static, predefined constants and straightforward string concatenation.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code detected.\n- The purpose is purely terminal display formatting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and purely utility-based.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n  No. The logic is straightforward and consistent with its purpose.\n\n- **Scores given to issues?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None. All are 0, correctly indicating no security concern.\n\n- **Malware score justification?**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, matching the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports rely on factual observations of the code.\n\n- **Score consistency?**  \n  Yes. The scores align with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The code is a standard utility for terminal ANSI escape sequences.\n- No input validation issues, no dynamic code execution, no external dependencies.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The code is well-documented and straightforward.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese match the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, standard ANSI escape code generator with no security risks. No changes needed in the scoring or analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
