  "purpose": "Generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting and cursor control.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "String concatenation forming escape sequences; these are standard terminal control codes.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code provides functions and classes for generating escape sequences, not data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected. All functions are for ANSI control code generation; no malicious or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, utility functions, and classes to produce ANSI escape sequences for text colors, styles, and cursor movements in terminals. It uses straightforward string concatenation and class attribute definitions. No input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a standard, well-documented utility for terminal formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for generating ANSI escape sequences. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code is clean, standard, and intentionally designed for terminal formatting purposes.",
