{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present; the code defines constants and functions for generating escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs ANSI escape sequences, which could be used to manipulate terminal display; no untrusted data handling or network communication present.",
  "flows": "The functions and class methods generate escape sequences directly based on input parameters, with no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code strictly generates ANSI codes without executing external commands or handling sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, utility functions, and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. It uses straightforward string concatenation and class attribute initialization without any dynamic code execution or external input processing. The design pattern is typical for terminal formatting libraries, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ANSI escape code generator library with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies. It provides terminal formatting utilities as intended without any indications of sabotage or malware.",
