  "purpose": "Unit testing ANSI escape code constants and styles in the modules.",
  "sources": "Static assertions of ANSI constants; sys.stdout and sys.stderr type checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Assertions verify constants; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static assertions verifying ANSI escape sequences and style constants. It manipulates sys.stdout and sys.stderr during setup and teardown but restores them immediately, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The tests are straightforward and serve to verify static constants. The minimal environment checks are standard in test suites and do not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite verifying ANSI escape code constants. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
