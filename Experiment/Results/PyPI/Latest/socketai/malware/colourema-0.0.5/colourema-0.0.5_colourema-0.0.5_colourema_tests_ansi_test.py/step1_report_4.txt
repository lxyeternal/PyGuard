  "purpose": "Unit testing for ANSI escape code definitions and their attributes in color styling modules.",
  "sources": "import statements, particularly 'sys' for stdout and stderr, and module attributes from '..ansi' and '..ansitowin32'. No external input data is read or handled.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; code does not process external input, user data, or network connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs attribute value assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The code only tests constant string values representing ANSI escape sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite validating the correctness of ANSI escape code constants in a styling module. It performs assertions on predefined string constants, checks the types of output streams, and resets streams after tests. There are no external data handling, no network operations, and no code execution or manipulation beyond simple value checks. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign unit testing script verifying constant values. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or security-critical operations. The code appears to be part of a styling library, and there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
