  "purpose": "The code appears to be a comment indicating copyright and licensing information, likely at the beginning of a Python source file.",
  "sources": "The source is the comment block at the beginning of the code, which contains license and copyright information.",
  "sinks": "No data input or output operations are present, so there are no sinks related to untrusted data or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow exists beyond the comment, so no source-to-sink flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment header with licensing information; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is solely a comment with licensing and copyright details. There are no executable statements, data inputs, or potentially malicious constructs. Since only a comment is present, there are no security concerns, no malware indicators, or obfuscation detected. The code fragment is benign and typical for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard license comment with no malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious activity or malware is present. The code is safe and serves as a legal notice.",
