  "analysis": "The code is a comment block with licensing information, containing no executable code, data input, or output. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the absence of any executable or suspicious elements. There are no anomalies or signals indicating malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code poses no security risk and is purely informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign comment with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are accurate and appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
