{
  "purpose": "The code provides Windows console API wrappers for manipulating console display, cursor position, buffer info, and title, primarily for Windows-based console applications.",
  "sources": "Functions that call Windows API via ctypes, such as _GetStdHandle, _GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, _SetConsoleTextAttribute, _SetConsoleCursorPosition, _SetConsoleTitleW, _GetConsoleMode, and _SetConsoleMode.",
  "sinks": "System handles and console functions that modify console state, such as text attributes, cursor position, buffer info, and title; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "Functions retrieve console info (sources) and modify console display or properties (sinks), with flow from handle retrieval to API calls that alter console state; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; straightforward use of Windows API functions; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of Windows console API wrappers implemented via ctypes, with proper handling of function signatures and error checking. It performs standard console manipulations without processing external input or performing network operations. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is well-structured, with fallbacks for non-Windows environments, and uses legitimate system calls for console control.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Windows console utility module, providing standard API wrappers with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero. The code is safe for use in Windows environments, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
