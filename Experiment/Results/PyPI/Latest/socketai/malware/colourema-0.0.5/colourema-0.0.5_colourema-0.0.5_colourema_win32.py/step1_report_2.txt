{
  "purpose": "This code provides Windows console API functions for manipulating console display attributes, cursor position, title, and mode. It appears to be intended for use in customizing console output and behavior in a Windows environment.",
  "sources": "Reads from standard output (STDOUT) and standard error (STDERR) handles via Windows API functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses Windows API functions to modify console state, such as SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, SetConsoleMode, and FillConsoleOutput functions, which can affect the console display.",
  "flows": "Reads console handles from standard handles -> calls Windows API functions to modify console buffer, attributes, cursor, title, or mode based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is heavily focused on Windows console manipulation; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious variable usage observed. All functions use standard Windows API calls for console handling. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for interacting with Windows console APIs, including retrieving buffer info, setting text attributes, cursor position, console title, and mode. It conditionally imports ctypes and loads Windows DLLs, with fallbacks if not available. The functions are standard wrappers around Windows API calls, with no suspicious logic or data handling. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are evident. The code is structured for legitimate console control and appears to be benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Windows console API wrapper, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It performs expected functions for console manipulation and does not exhibit any malicious behavior.",
