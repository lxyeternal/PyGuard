{
  "purpose": "The code provides Windows console manipulation functionalities, including reading console info, setting text attributes, cursor position, console title, and modes. It appears designed to customize or control terminal output on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads system handle values (STDOUT, STDERR), and retrieves console buffer info via Windows API functions such as GetStdHandle and GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo.",
  "sinks": "Functions that modify console state, such as SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute, SetConsoleTitle, SetConsoleMode, which could potentially alter console appearance or behavior.",
  "flows": "Input from system handles (STDOUT, STDERR) flows into console info retrieval functions. Data retrieved may influence functions that modify console appearance. No untrusted external input flows into the code; data flow is mainly from system handles to console functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. The code strictly wraps Windows API calls for console control. No signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or stealth functions. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns. The only slight concern is the presence of low-level Windows API usage, but this is typical for console control scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ctypes to interface with Windows API for console manipulation. It defines structures and functions for retrieving and setting console properties, including cursor position, text attributes, window info, and console title. All functions perform standard system calls with proper argument types and error handling. The code does not perform any network activity, file system modification, or data exfiltration. It is solely for console display management. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. It appears as legitimate system utility code intended for console customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console manipulation utility, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely interfaces with Windows API to control console appearance and behavior. No suspicious or harmful actions are detected.",
