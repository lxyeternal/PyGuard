{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with Windows console APIs for manipulating console display attributes, cursor positions, titles, and buffer information.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'ctypes' library to load Windows DLL functions and retrieve console information and control console behavior.",
  "sinks": "Functions that manipulate console attributes, positions, and titles, which could potentially be exploited if untrusted input influences parameters, but they are standard API calls.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves console handles and buffer info, then uses these to modify console display attributes and positions, but there are no data flows from untrusted sources to these functions in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Functions are straightforward wrappers around Windows API calls with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. No network activity or file manipulation is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads Windows console API functions via ctypes and provides utility functions to get and set console attributes, cursor position, title, and buffer info. These functions depend on Windows-specific APIs and do not process untrusted input. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code appears to be standard system interaction code for console manipulation, with proper use of ctypes and error handling where needed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Windows console API wrapper without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware or security risks, only system utility functions for console management.",
