{
  "purpose": "This module imports core functions and version information, and attempts to run pre-install checks during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads local modules (.cli, .version, .installer) and executes run_pre_install() if available.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external effects are observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements → attempt to import and run run_pre_install() during module load",
  "anomalies": "Calling run_pre_install() during import may execute code that could perform actions at install time; however, this is a common pattern for setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and exposes main and version info. It conditionally imports and executes run_pre_install() if available, which is typical for setup or installation scripts. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or external data leaks are evident. The run_pre_install() function’s behavior depends on its implementation, which is not provided; its invocation during import could potentially perform install-time checks or actions, but this alone does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a package setup script, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The invocation of run_pre_install() is conditional and typical for pre-install checks.",
