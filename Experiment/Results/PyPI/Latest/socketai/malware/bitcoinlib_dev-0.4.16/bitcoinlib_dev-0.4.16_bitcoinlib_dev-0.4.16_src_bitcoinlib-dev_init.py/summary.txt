  "conclusion": "The code pattern is typical for setup or initialization scripts, executing optional pre-install checks during import. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the execution of code during import, which is low risk here. The scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2. Overall, the code is safe, but caution is advised if run_pre_install() is untrusted."
