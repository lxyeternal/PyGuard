  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing core components and optionally executing pre-install checks during module import.",
  "sources": "Imports from .cli, .version, and optionally from .installer for run_pre_install().",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_pre_install() during import; no other untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Imports occur at module load; run_pre_install() is called immediately if available, representing a source-to-sink flow during import.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of run_pre_install() during module import is unconventional; no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and sets __all__ for exports. It attempts to import and execute run_pre_install() during import, with exception handling to ignore import errors. All reports correctly identify this pattern as standard but somewhat unusual. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The execution during import could pose a risk if run_pre_install() is malicious, but in absence of evidence, this remains a low concern. Malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero; the security risk score is low (0.2) due to the pattern of executing code at import time. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern is typical for setup or initialization scripts, executing optional pre-install checks during import. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the execution of code during import, which is low risk here. The scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2. Overall, the code is safe, but caution is advised if run_pre_install() is untrusted.",
