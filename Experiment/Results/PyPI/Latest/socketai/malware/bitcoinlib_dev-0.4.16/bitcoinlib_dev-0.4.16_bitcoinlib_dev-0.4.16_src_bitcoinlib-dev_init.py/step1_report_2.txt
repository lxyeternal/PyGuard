  "purpose": "The code initializes module exports and performs pre-install checks during import, likely for setup validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for cli, version, and installer modules; invocation of run_pre_install() if available.",

  "flows": "Import of modules -> calling run_pre_install() during import -> potential side effects if run_pre_install() has malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of run_pre_install() during import without clear indication of its actions; no validation or security checks on run_pre_install().",
  "analysis": "The code imports core modules and exports main and version information. It attempts to run run_pre_install() from the installer module if available, which could execute arbitrary pre-installation logic. The try-except block ensures that failure to import or execute run_pre_install() does not halt the process. Without inspecting run_pre_install(), it’s impossible to determine if malicious activity occurs. The code structure itself is typical for setup scripts, with no evident malicious indicators. However, executing code during import can be risky if run_pre_install() is malicious or poorly secured.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup or initialization snippet that executes a pre-install check via run_pre_install(). There are no clear signs of malicious behavior within this code segment itself, but the potential for malicious activity hinges on the implementation of run_pre_install(), which is external to this snippet. The overall security risk appears low based on the provided code but depends on the integrity of run_pre_install().",
