  "purpose": "The code initializes the module exports, attempts to run pre-install checks if available, and manages version information.",
  "sources": "The import of run_pre_install from .installer, which is executed immediately if import is successful.",
  "sinks": "The immediate execution of run_pre_install upon import, which could perform any actions defined within that function.",
  "flows": "Import of run_pre_install (source) -> execution during import (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The call to run_pre_install occurs unconditionally during import, which is unusual as it may execute code at import time without explicit invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports main and version info, defines __all__ for exports, and conditionally executes run_pre_install from the installer module upon import. This design is typical for setup or CLI tools, where pre-install checks might be necessary. Since run_pre_install is executed during module import, it could perform any actions defined within that function, which might include security-sensitive operations. However, without the content of run_pre_install, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The pattern itself is not inherently malicious, but executing code on import warrants caution. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious side effects in this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard initialization code with a conditional pre-install check. No malicious behavior is evident; the execution of run_pre_install at import time is a common pattern for setup scripts. The security risk is low, assuming run_pre_install is safe and trusted.",
