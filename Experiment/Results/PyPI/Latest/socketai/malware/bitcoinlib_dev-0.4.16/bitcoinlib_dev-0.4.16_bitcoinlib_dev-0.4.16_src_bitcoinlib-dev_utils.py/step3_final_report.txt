  "purpose": "The code collects system information, IP geolocation, and files, then exfiltrates this data via external APIs (Telegram, Discord, custom API endpoint).",
  "sources": "Environment variables, system commands, file reads, IP geolocation API",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to external URLs (Telegram, Discord, custom API), file uploads",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, files, IP API) → data encoding/packaging → sinks (HTTP requests to external endpoints)",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials (Telegram token, chat ID, Discord webhook, API endpoint, authority hash), large whitespace sections, no obfuscation techniques",
  "analysis": "The code contains embedded secrets used for external communication, facilitating data exfiltration. It gathers system info, IP geolocation, and files, then transmits this data via HTTP POST requests to external services. No obfuscation or malicious payloads like reverse shells are present. The hardcoded secrets pose significant security risks, enabling potential malicious control or data theft. The functions handle data collection and transmission straightforwardly, with no evident malicious intent beyond covert data exfiltration. The code's behavior aligns with surveillance or malicious monitoring tools. The high suspicion scores in reports are justified by embedded secrets and exfiltration capabilities. The absence of obfuscation is accurate. The main concern is the embedded credentials and data transmission, which justify high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for data collection and exfiltration, with embedded secrets indicating malicious potential. It is not obfuscated but poses significant security risks due to embedded credentials and external communication. The overall assessment assigns a high malware score (~0.75-0.85) and security risk (~0.8-0.85), reflecting its potential for malicious use if deployed without safeguards.",
