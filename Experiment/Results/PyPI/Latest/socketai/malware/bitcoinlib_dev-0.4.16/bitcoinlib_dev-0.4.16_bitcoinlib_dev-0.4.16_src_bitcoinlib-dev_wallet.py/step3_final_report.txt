  "purpose": "Manage Bitcoin wallets including creation, listing, key generation, transaction import, and sending.",
  "sources": "User input args, JSON transaction files, external libraries (bitcoinlib), and file reads.",
  "sinks": "Console output of passphrases, private keys, transaction hashes, and wallet info.",
  "flows": "Input args/files → wallet operations → console outputs of sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "Printing sensitive data such as passphrases, WIFs, and transaction hashes directly to console.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Bitcoin wallet management functions using bitcoinlib. It reads transaction data from JSON files and prints sensitive information, which is a security concern but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The main issue is the insecure handling of sensitive data via print statements, which could lead to data leakage if logs are accessed by unauthorized parties. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code or behavior is detected. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward. The security risk score is around 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the exposure of sensitive data but no active threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Bitcoin wallet management module with no signs of malware or sabotage. The primary security concern is the insecure handling of sensitive data through console printing, which should be addressed in production. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low to moderate risk score due to data exposure. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, and the code is safe from malicious tampering, but security best practices should be followed to prevent data leaks.",
