  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Bitcoin wallet management module with no signs of malware or sabotage. The primary security concern is the insecure handling of sensitive data through console printing, which should be addressed in production. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low to moderate risk score due to data exposure. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, and the code is safe from malicious tampering, but security best practices should be followed to prevent data leaks."
