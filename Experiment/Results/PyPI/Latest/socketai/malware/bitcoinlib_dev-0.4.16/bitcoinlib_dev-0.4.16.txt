      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code pattern is typical for setup or initialization scripts, executing optional pre-install checks during import. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the execution of code during import, which is low risk here. The scores are appropriately low, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2. Overall, the code is safe, but caution is advised if run_pre_install() is untrusted."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate wallet CLI tool with no malware or malicious intent. The primary security issue is potential privacy leakage via verbose logging and transmission of sensitive data. These are privacy concerns rather than active threats. To improve security, sensitive data handling should be secured, and logging practices should be sanitized. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to privacy leakage potential."

      "conclusion": "The provided scores are consistent with the reports' content and suspicious indicators. Report 4's high scores are justified by multiple signs of malicious behavior. Reports 1-3 and 5 appropriately reflect low to moderate suspicion given the lack of concrete code or malicious patterns. No adjustments are necessary."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Bitcoin wallet management module with no signs of malware or sabotage. The primary security concern is the insecure handling of sensitive data through console printing, which should be addressed in production. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low to moderate risk score due to data exposure. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, and the code is safe from malicious tampering, but security best practices should be followed to prevent data leaks."

      "conclusion": "The code is designed for data collection and exfiltration, with embedded secrets indicating malicious potential. It is not obfuscated but poses significant security risks due to embedded credentials and external communication. The overall assessment assigns a high malware score (~0.75-0.85) and security risk (~0.8-0.85), reflecting its potential for malicious use if deployed without safeguards."

The low risk score (0.2) is justified by filesystem operations and user prompts, which are standard safeguards. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the script poses minimal security threat and is safe for use."
