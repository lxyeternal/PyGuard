{
  "purpose": "This script manages and updates the BitcoinLib database, including version checks, data migration, and backups.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the existing database files, user input for confirmation prompts, and environment variables are not used.",
  "sinks": "Database operations, file moves for backups, and user input handling could be potential points where untrusted data could influence behavior, but there are no direct data leaks or malicious actions initiated from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The script reads from backup databases, processes and inserts data into new database tables, and performs file operations based on user confirmation. No external network connections or command executions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are observed. The code appears to perform standard database update and migration functions with proper use of file operations and data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs database version checking, data migration from a backup database, and backup creation, all within a controlled environment. It uses standard libraries and follows safe practices for database handling. User prompts for confirmation add an interactive safeguard. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or obfuscated code are present. The logic appears consistent with expected database update procedures. Overall, the code functions as a maintenance utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical database migration tool for BitcoinLib, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It securely handles backups, data processing, and version control, aligning with expected functionality. The malware score is low, and security risk is minimal.",
