  "purpose": "The code implements a command-line interface for managing Bitcoin wallets, including wallet creation, updates, transaction handling, and database interactions.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, file paths provided via arguments, and the initial print of sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "The method send_to_all, which transmits file contents or text data, potentially over network or storage, and the print statement of sys.argv.",
  "flows": "Input data from command-line args or files is processed and passed to send_to_all or wallet/database functions; sys.argv is printed at startup, potentially exposing sensitive inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Printing sys.argv at startup, which may include sensitive data; sending private keys, passwords, or passphrases via send_to_all without encryption; broad exception handling that silences errors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI for Bitcoin wallet management, with extensive argument parsing and data handling. It logs command-line inputs, which could leak sensitive info, and transmits data via send_to_all, possibly exposing private data if misused. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are evident. Exception handling is broad, potentially masking errors but not malicious. The send_to_all function's implementation isn't provided, so its behavior can't be fully assessed, but based on context, it may transmit data externally. Overall, no malicious code or backdoors are present; the main concern is privacy leakage through logs and data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate wallet CLI tool with no malware or malicious intent. The primary security issue is potential privacy leakage via verbose logging and transmission of sensitive data. These are privacy concerns rather than active threats. To improve security, sensitive data handling should be secured, and logging practices should be sanitized. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to privacy leakage potential.",
