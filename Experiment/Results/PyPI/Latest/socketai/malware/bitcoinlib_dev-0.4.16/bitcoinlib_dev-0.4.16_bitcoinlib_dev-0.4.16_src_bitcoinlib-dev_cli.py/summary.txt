  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate wallet CLI tool with no malware or malicious intent. The primary security issue is potential privacy leakage via verbose logging and transmission of sensitive data. These are privacy concerns rather than active threats. To improve security, sensitive data handling should be secured, and logging practices should be sanitized. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.3 due to privacy leakage potential."
