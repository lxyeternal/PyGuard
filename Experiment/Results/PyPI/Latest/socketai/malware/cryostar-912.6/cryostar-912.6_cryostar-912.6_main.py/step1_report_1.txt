  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) -> URL with query parameters -> network request to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Sending system info to suspicious external domains, use of multiple URLs with obfuscated domain names, no user consent prompts, potential covert data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs targeting three suspicious domains. It sends the collected info as URL parameters via HTTP GET requests. The use of obfuscated, non-standard domain names suggests possible malicious intent for tracking or data exfiltration. There are no visible signs of malicious payload execution, but the behavior of stealthy data collection and transmission to unknown domains indicates malicious or at least suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects environment details and transmits them to external, potentially malicious domains without user consent. It appears to perform covert reconnaissance or tracking. The use of suspicious domains and data exfiltration patterns raise security concerns.",
