  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While no active malicious payloads are present, the activity pattern is serious enough to warrant high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
