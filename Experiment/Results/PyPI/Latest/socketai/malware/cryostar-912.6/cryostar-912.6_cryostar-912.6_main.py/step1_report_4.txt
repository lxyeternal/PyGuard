  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs with a random identifier",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() with constructed URLs containing system info and a random number",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) and random number are embedded into URLs and sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "The code communicates with suspicious domains, uses a random number for request variability, and transmits system data without user consent or encryption. No explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected, but the pattern suggests data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious domains and sends the system info as URL parameters via HTTP GET requests. The communication occurs without user consent and targets domains that appear suspicious or related to known malicious infrastructure. The data sent could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. No malicious payload or backdoor behavior observed, but the pattern of data collection and transmission is suspicious and resembles C2 or data harvesting activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be collecting system data and sending it to external servers, which raises concerns about potential data exfiltration or tracking. While no explicit malicious payload or backdoor code is present, the activity pattern is suspicious and warrants caution. The code does not contain obfuscation or malware signatures but exhibits behavior consistent with covert data transmission.",
