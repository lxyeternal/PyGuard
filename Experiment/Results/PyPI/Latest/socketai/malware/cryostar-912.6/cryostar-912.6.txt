      "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' during installation, which poses a significant security risk if 'main()' is malicious. While the code itself is not obfuscated and contains no secrets, this pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The suspicion levels and scores across reports are justified; a high malware score (~0.75) and risk (~0.8) are appropriate given the behavior. Without inspecting 'main()', the threat cannot be confirmed but should be treated as high potential risk."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While no active malicious payloads are present, the activity pattern is serious enough to warrant high malware and security risk scores. The code is not obfuscated, but its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
