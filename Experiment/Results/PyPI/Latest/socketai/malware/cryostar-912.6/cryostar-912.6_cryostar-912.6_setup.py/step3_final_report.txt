{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom setup class that, after running the standard installation, imports and executes the 'main' function from a local module, thereby executing arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class, which calls 'main()' after installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if 'main()' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During 'run()', the flow proceeds from the installation process to importing 'main' and executing 'main()' immediately afterward.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of 'main()' during setup, which is unusual and potentially malicious; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code unconditionally executes 'main()' during installation, a pattern often exploited in supply chain attacks to run malicious code. The behavior is straightforward but risky, as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time. The provided reports correctly identify this pattern as suspicious, assigning malware scores between 0.25 and 0.75 based on suspicion levels. Given the lack of inspection of 'main()', the risk remains potential rather than confirmed. The scores are consistent with the behavior; higher suspicion correlates with higher scores. The overall risk is high because executing code during setup can be exploited maliciously. The obfuscated score is zero, as the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' during installation, which poses a significant security risk if 'main()' is malicious. While the code itself is not obfuscated and contains no secrets, this pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The suspicion levels and scores across reports are justified; a high malware score (~0.75) and risk (~0.8) are appropriate given the behavior. Without inspecting 'main()', the threat cannot be confirmed but should be treated as high potential risk.",
