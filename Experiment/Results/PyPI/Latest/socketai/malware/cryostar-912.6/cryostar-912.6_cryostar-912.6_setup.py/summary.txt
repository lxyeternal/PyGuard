  "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' during installation, which poses a significant security risk if 'main()' is malicious. While the code itself is not obfuscated and contains no secrets, this pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The suspicion levels and scores across reports are justified; a high malware score (~0.75) and risk (~0.8) are appropriate given the behavior. Without inspecting 'main()', the threat cannot be confirmed but should be treated as high potential risk."
