  "purpose": "The code writes a greeting message to a text file located in the user's AppData directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variable 'APPDATA' to determine the file storage location.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to a file in the AppData directory, which is a local system operation.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'APPDATA' (source) is used to determine file path; data is written to a file (sink) in that location.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code performs a simple, benign file write operation.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the 'APPDATA' environment variable, constructs a file path, and writes a greeting message to 'text.txt' in that directory. This is a typical operation for local data storage or configuration. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The environment variable usage is standard, and the file operation is straightforward and safe. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or anomalous behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign action of writing a message to a file in the user's AppData directory without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a simple, harmless utility or example script.",
