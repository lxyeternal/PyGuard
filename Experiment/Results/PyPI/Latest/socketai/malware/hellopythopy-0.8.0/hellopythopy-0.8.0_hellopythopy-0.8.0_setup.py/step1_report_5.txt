{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external executable (putty.exe) during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe' from which the executable is downloaded.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.Popen call that executes the downloaded putty.exe file.",
  "flows": "Download from URL -> Save to 'putty.exe' -> Execute 'putty.exe' via subprocess.Popen during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of external executable during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. No validation or user consent is involved.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to download a known external program (putty.exe) from a URL and then immediately executes it. This behavior occurs every time the package is installed, without user interaction or validation. Such a pattern can be used maliciously to run arbitrary code on the target system, especially since the URL points to an external resource outside of the package's repository. The code does not perform any security checks, validation, or restrictions. It effectively acts as a backdoor or malicious payload, depending on the intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a malicious-like behavior by downloading and executing an external program during installation without user consent or validation, representing a security risk. This behavior is highly suspicious and could be malicious if used with malicious intent.",
