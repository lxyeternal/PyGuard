{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple relative import statement intended to import the 'run' function from a local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the 'main' module from the local package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; the code does not process or output data, so no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the import simply references a local module without dynamic execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard relative import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is simple and lacks any indicators of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; however, the risk score could be slightly lowered from 0.9 to 0.1 to better reflect the minimal risk associated with a simple import. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
