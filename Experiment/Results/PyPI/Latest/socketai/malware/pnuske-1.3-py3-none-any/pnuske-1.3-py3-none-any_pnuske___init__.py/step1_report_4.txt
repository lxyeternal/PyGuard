  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only an import statement; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists solely of an import statement importing 'run' from a relative module 'main'. There are no sources of user input, network activity, or other data inputs. No sinks or outputs are present, and no dynamic or obfuscated code detected. The code appears to be part of a larger program, but this fragment itself does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
