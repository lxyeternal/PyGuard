  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement with relative module reference; no suspicious patterns or secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module, indicating modular design. It does not perform any data processing, input/output operations, or network activity. The import statement is standard and does not pose security risks by itself. Given its simplicity, no anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import a function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues within this snippet.",
