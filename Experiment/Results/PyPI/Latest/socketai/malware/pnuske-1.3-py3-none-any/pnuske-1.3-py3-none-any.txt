      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; however, the risk score could be slightly lowered from 0.9 to 0.1 to better reflect the minimal risk associated with a simple import. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
