  "conclusion": "The code is a simple launcher with no malicious logic embedded. The main security concern is executing an external binary without validation, which could be malicious. The current scores should be adjusted to reflect this risk, with a malware score around 0.6 and a security risk score similarly elevated. The code itself is benign, but the external binary's trustworthiness determines overall safety."
