  "conclusion": "The script itself is benign but acts as a conduit for executing external scripts and modules, which could be malicious if compromised. The main security concern is the trustworthiness of external dependencies, especially with commands like 'nukeserver'. The code lacks additional validation or sandboxing, increasing the attack surface. Therefore, the overall risk is moderate, with low internal malware but significant external supply chain risk."
