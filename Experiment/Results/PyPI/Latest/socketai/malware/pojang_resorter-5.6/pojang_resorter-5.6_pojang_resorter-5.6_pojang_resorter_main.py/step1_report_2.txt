  "purpose": "This script acts as a command-line interface (CLI) to execute various server-related scripts or functions, including initialization, preview, help display, operator assignment, and server nuking.",
  "sources": "User input through command-line arguments ('command' and 'extra_args') that determine which scripts or functions are invoked.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess commands to run other Python scripts; importing and calling functions from local modules ('pojange_resorter.forceop' and 'pojange_resorter.nukeserver').",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) -> command validation -> mapped script/function import or subprocess call -> execution of local scripts or functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports functions based on command input without thorough validation, and executes scripts via subprocess. There is a potential risk if command inputs are manipulated to invoke unintended scripts or functions. The 'assign_operator' and 'nukeserver' commands import and run external code which may have side effects.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts command-line input to determine actions, with predefined command mappings. It uses 'subprocess.run' to execute scripts based on user commands, and dynamically imports specific functions for 'assign_operator' and 'nukeserver' commands. These imports and subprocess executions are controlled via known command mappings. The 'nukeserver' command could potentially be dangerous if the called script has malicious intent, but the code itself only delegates execution to external scripts. The script does not perform any code injection, file access outside the intended scripts, or network communication. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. The dynamic import is limited to known modules, and the subprocess commands are straightforward. The overall design is a standard CLI dispatcher with minimal suspicious code behavior. However, invoking 'nukeserver' could be dangerous if the called script is malicious, but that is external to this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a command dispatcher executing predefined scripts and functions based on user input. It does not contain malicious behavior or backdoors within itself. Its main risk lies in the external scripts it invokes ('nukeserver' and 'forceop'), which are outside the scope of this review. The dynamic import and subprocess call are controlled via command mappings, reducing risk. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no evident malicious intent or security violations.",
