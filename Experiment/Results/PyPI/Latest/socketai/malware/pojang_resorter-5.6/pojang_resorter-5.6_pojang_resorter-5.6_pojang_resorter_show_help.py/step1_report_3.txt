{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with a hypothetical Python-Mojang tool, displaying help information with ASCII art and colored text.",
  "sources": "Input source is the command-line arguments parsed via argparse.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console using print statements, but does not process or execute untrusted data in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments (source) are used to determine the help display and command options, which are only used for display purposes and do not influence code execution beyond argparse handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The ASCII art and color formatting are purely aesthetic and do not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes color output with colorama, defines a function to display help with ASCII art and colored headers, and sets up command-line arguments for various subcommands. All parts are for user interface display only. No data is read from external sources besides command-line arguments, and no data is sent or processed in a malicious way. There are no suspicious behaviors, code injections, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script with ASCII art and colored text. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
