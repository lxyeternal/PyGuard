{
  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and command help descriptions for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Static ASCII art and command description strings within the show_help() function.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statements; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Execution flow from show_help() calling print with static strings; no dynamic data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and purely for display purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a show_help() function that displays ASCII art and command descriptions, and uses argparse to set up four subcommands. All elements are static, with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The subcommands are placeholders only, serving as help descriptions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no security risks or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with ASCII art and command descriptions. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
