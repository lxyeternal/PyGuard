{
  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool for interacting with a Minecraft server, displaying help and ASCII art with colored formatting.",
  "sources": "argparse for command-line argument parsing, colorama for colored terminal output",
  "sinks": "Printing to console, argparse's internal help functions",
  "flows": "User input via command line -> argparse parsing -> display of ASCII art and help information",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, no suspicious file handling, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for terminal colors, defines a function to show help with ASCII art and colored text, and sets up command-line subcommands for server management. All functionalities are limited to displaying static text and help information. No input data is processed beyond argument parsing, and there are no network or system modification operations. The code structure and content are straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI helper script that displays ASCII art and command descriptions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
