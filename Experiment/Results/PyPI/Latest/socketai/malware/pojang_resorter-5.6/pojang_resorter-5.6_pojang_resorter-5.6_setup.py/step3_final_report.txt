  "purpose": "Defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for the Python project 'pojang_resorter'.",
  "sources": "Reads package data, dependencies, and executable inclusion; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no data leaks or external effects within this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script only sets up package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' in package_data; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a standard configuration script with no suspicious or malicious code. The dependencies are common libraries, and the code structure is straightforward. The only anomaly is the inclusion of a Windows executable, which warrants external inspection but does not indicate malicious intent within this script. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behaviors are present. The malware score remains at 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the clarity of the code. The security risk score is set at 0.2, accounting for the unusual executable inclusion but not implying maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is benign and standard, with the primary concern being the inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe'. This warrants separate inspection but does not impact the security assessment of the script itself. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
