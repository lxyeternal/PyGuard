  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "Setup arguments such as install_requires, package_data, and the code defining package configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potential for malicious code execution if dependencies or entry points are exploited, but none are explicitly malicious here.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. All dependencies are common, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies dependencies, entry points, and includes a Windows executable as package data. No code execution, user input handling, or network operations are present in this script. All dependencies are typical for multimedia and automation tasks. The setup is straightforward and adheres to typical packaging conventions without suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a normal package setup file.",
