{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name, version, dependencies, entry points, Python version requirements, and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is used internally for package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "The inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' as package data is unusual in Python packages, possibly indicating embedding of a Windows executable, which warrants further scrutiny. No other anomalies or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script utilizing setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and console scripts. The dependencies listed are common in various applications, with no apparent misuse. The package data includes a Windows executable, which is uncommon but not inherently malicious. The script does not process any untrusted input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated or suspicious code. Overall, the code appears straightforward and intended for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with an unusual inclusion of a Windows executable as package data. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this code alone.",
