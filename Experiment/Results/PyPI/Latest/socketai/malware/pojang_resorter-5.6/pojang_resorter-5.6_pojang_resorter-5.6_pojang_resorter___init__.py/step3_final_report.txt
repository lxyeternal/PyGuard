{
  "purpose": "Minimal package initializer importing main module and defining metadata",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .main import main', metadata variables '__version__' and '__author__'",
  "sinks": "None; no external communication or data processing",
  "flows": "Import from local module '.main' without external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard package structure",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package __init__.py file with no input handling, external communication, or malicious code. The import of '.main' is typical for Python packages and does not indicate malicious intent unless the imported module is malicious, which cannot be determined here. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The metadata variables are harmless. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions suggest it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization code with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores of malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk are all 0, which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
