  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly by importing the main function and defining version and author metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, module-level string variables (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines metadata",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a local module, sets version and author metadata. No input handling, no data leaks, no external communication, no suspicious behavior detected. The structure is straightforward, minimal, and typical for a package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initializer with no malicious intent, suspicious activities, or security risks identified.",
