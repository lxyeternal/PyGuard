{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The __version__ and __author__ variables, and the import statement from .main.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leakage or system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is apparent, as the code only declares metadata and imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module. There are no input sources, no data processing, no system calls, or network operations. The import statement could load arbitrary code if the 'main' module is malicious, but this is standard for Python packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple package metadata and import statements, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be standard package scaffolding.",
