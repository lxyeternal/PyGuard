{
  "purpose": "The code defines metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, serving as an entry point for the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.main' and assignments of version and author metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform critical actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and metadata assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata declarations (__version__, __author__) and a straightforward import statement for the main function. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, network calls, or other potentially malicious actions. The import is from a relative module, typical for package initialization files. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package __init__.py file for a CLI tool, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
