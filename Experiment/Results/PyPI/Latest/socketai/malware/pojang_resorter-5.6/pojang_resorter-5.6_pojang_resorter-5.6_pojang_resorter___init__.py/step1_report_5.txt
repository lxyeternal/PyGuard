{
  "purpose": "Provides basic metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports from a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no user input or external data sources are processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static imports and variable definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials (beyond version and author), or suspicious code behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module metadata and a single import statement. It does not process user input, handle files, or perform network operations. The import is a relative import from the same package, which is typical in modular Python code. No signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, serving as a simple module setup with metadata and an import. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
