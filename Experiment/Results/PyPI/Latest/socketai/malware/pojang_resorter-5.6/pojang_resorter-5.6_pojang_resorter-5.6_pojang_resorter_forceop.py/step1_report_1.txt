{
  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are command-line arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password.",
  "sinks": "The sink is the execution of the mcr.command with the 'op' command, which modifies server state; also logs and print statements.",
  "flows": "User provides inputs -> Inputs are passed to assign_operator -> connect via MCRcon -> execute 'op {username}' command -> server processes command.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or malicious code structures. Usage of external library 'mcrcon' is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code takes user input to connect to a Minecraft server and issues an 'op' command to grant operator privileges. It logs connection attempts and errors. No data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior identified. The command execution directly affects server state but is expected behavior for administrative scripts. No suspicious or malicious code is present. Overall, the script performs a legitimate administrative function without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward administrative script to assign operator privileges on a Minecraft server. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It relies on user-provided inputs and performs expected server commands without harmful side effects.",
