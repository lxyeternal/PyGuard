  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password.",
  "sinks": "Executes a command 'op {username}' on the Minecraft server through the MCRcon connection.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used directly in the mcr.command call to assign operator privileges.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code constructs. Logging is standard. No hidden backdoors or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code securely uses provided arguments to connect to a Minecraft server via RCON and execute a command to assign operator privileges. It logs connection attempts and errors. No sensitive data is stored or transmitted outside of the intended command. No external network connections aside from the RCON interaction. No malicious or suspicious code segments detected. The use of argparse for input and mcrcon for remote command execution is standard practice. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate administrative function without evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It is a straightforward script for managing server permissions.",
