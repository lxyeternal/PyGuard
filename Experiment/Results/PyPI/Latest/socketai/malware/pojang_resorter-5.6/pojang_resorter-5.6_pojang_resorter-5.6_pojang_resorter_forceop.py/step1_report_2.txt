{
  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password from command line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Uses the MCRcon library to send the command 'op {username}' to the Minecraft server, which affects server state.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are taken from command line args and passed directly into the assign_operator function, which then sends a command over the network to the server.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; logging to a file; straightforward command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive inputs (server IP, RCON password, username) via command line. It then connects to the server using the MCRcon library and issues an 'op' command to grant operator privileges. All operations are standard and appropriate for remote server management. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The use of logging is benign and for operational tracking. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate administrative function with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on the user to supply valid credentials and does not contain hidden or malicious code.",
