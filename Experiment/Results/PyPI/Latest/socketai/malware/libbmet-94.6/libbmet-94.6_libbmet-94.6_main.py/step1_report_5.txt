  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses; encode the MAC addresses; send this data to multiple remote URLs as part of a tracking or data collection process.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and MAC addresses (via get_mac_addresses() function).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to external URLs with system data embedded in URL parameters via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and MAC addresses) are encoded and then included in URL parameters, which are transmitted over HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs contacted are suspicious, possibly malicious or used for tracking; MAC addresses are base64-encoded, which could be used to obfuscate data exfiltration. The code contacts multiple external domains, some with unusual TLDs and subdomains, potentially for malicious data collection. No explicit user input is used; data is collected silently.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system identifiers (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses), encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to multiple external domains via GET requests. The domains look suspicious and possibly malicious, and the behavior resembles tracking or data exfiltration. No obvious malicious payloads (such as reverse shells, system modification, or malware delivery) are present, but the data collection and external communication patterns are potentially malicious or privacy-invasive. The code does not obfuscate its intent explicitly but uses base64 encoding to obscure MAC address data. The URLs and data collection points suggest the purpose may be to track or identify systems without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs silent collection of system information and sends it to external, suspicious domains. This pattern indicates malicious or privacy-invasive behavior, likely for tracking or data exfiltration. There are no signs of destructive malware, but the covert data transmission is concerning from a security perspective.",
