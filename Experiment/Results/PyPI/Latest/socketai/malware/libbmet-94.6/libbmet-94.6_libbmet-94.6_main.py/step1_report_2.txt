  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to specific external URLs encoded in base64, likely for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network info, and random.randint() generating an identifier.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP GET requests to external domains with encoded parameters containing system info and a random number.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from platform, getpass, os, and get_mac_addresses(); data is encoded with base64; parameters are assembled and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with non-standard domain names, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and the collection of multiple system identifiers suggest tracking behavior. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed, but the network activity to unknown domains is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across different OSes, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to multiple external domains via HTTP GET requests. The URLs appear malicious or at least suspicious, indicating potential tracking or reconnaissance activity. The code uses standard libraries without obfuscation but performs data exfiltration to untrusted domains. No malicious payloads or destructive actions are evident, but the behavior is privacy-invasive and could be used maliciously if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a system information collector that exfiltrates data to external suspicious domains, indicating possible malicious tracking or reconnaissance behavior. While it does not include destructive malware, its network activity and data collection raise security concerns.",
