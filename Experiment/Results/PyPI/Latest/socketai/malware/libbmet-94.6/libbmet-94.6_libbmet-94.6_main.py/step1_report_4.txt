  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then encode and send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading MAC addresses, and the random.randint() function for generating a number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs with encoded parameters, potentially leaking sensitive system info.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, encoded MAC addresses, random number) is collected and sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, and sending data without any form of user consent or encryption. The URLs are non-standard and may be malicious command and control servers.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system information, including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current working directory. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to obscure their content before transmission. The code constructs URLs with these parameters and makes GET requests to three suspicious domains. The URL patterns suggest data exfiltration or remote command execution infrastructure. There are no checks for user permissions, no validation of URLs, and no error reporting—just silent attempts to send data, indicating potential malicious intent. The use of hardcoded URLs and obfuscation of MAC addresses supports suspicion of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for data exfiltration of system identifiers to potentially malicious servers. It collects and encodes system data and sends it to suspicious domains without user consent or encryption, indicating malicious intent.",
