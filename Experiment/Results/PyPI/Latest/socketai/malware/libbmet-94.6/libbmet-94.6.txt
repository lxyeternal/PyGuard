      "conclusion": "The code's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' contains malicious code. The behavior is consistent with supply chain attack vectors. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this high risk, with a malware score around 0.8 and a security risk near 0.9. This pattern warrants caution and further inspection of 'main()' before trusting or distributing the package."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration of system information to suspicious domains, posing significant privacy and security risks. It does not contain malicious payloads or destructive actions, so malware suspicion should be moderate. The current scores are reasonable; slight adjustments to malware scores upward (to ~0.3-0.4) are recommended to better reflect the exfiltration behavior, while risk scores remain high due to privacy invasion. Overall, the behavior warrants caution and further investigation but does not constitute confirmed malware."
