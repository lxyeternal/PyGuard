  "conclusion": "The code's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' contains malicious code. The behavior is consistent with supply chain attack vectors. The scores should be adjusted to reflect this high risk, with a malware score around 0.8 and a security risk near 0.9. This pattern warrants caution and further inspection of 'main()' before trusting or distributing the package."
