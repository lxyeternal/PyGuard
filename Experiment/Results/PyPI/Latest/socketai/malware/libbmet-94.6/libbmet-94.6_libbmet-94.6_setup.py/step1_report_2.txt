  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the Python package 'libbmet' with a custom installation step that executes a function from 'main' module post-installation.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' and call to 'main()' within the 'run' method of the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'main' module during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method is invoked, which imports 'main' and executes 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code ('main()') at install time, which is uncommon and potentially suspicious if 'main()' contains malicious payloads or unintended side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration that uses a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat'. This class extends the standard 'install' command and overrides the 'run' method to execute 'main()' from a module called 'main' after installation. The purpose of executing 'main()' at install time is unusual and could be used to run malicious or unwanted code on user systems without explicit consent. No other malicious behaviors like network communications, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code structure itself appears normal but the inclusion of code execution during install is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes a function from an external module ('main') during installation, which is uncommon and potentially malicious. This behavior warrants caution, as it could be used to run harmful code post-installation. The code itself does not contain clear malicious payloads but the side effect of executing arbitrary code at install time is suspicious.",
