  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2' with dependencies, version info, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for directories 'fabric' and 'fabric2', reading version info from '_version.py', reading README.rst content.",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables, reading files ('_version.py' and 'README.rst'), executing code from '_version.py', setting up package dependencies and entry points.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences package and binary name -> Directory checks influence package selection -> Reading version file -> Reading README file -> Executing '_version.py' -> Passing dependencies and entry points to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of 'exec' to execute content of '_version.py' is a standard pattern for version extraction but can be risky if the file is malicious, although common in package setup scripts. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution found. No network activity or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard package setup procedures: reading environment variables, checking directory existence, reading version info from a local file, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. The use of 'exec' to evaluate '_version.py' is typical but should be considered a minor security risk if the file content is malicious, which is unlikely in a controlled setup context. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are evident. The code does not perform any network activity, file modifications outside the setup context, or sensitive data handling beyond standard setup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious code. It uses standard practices, with a minor security note regarding 'exec' on local files. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
