{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'fabrice', configuring dependencies, entry points, and package information.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for directories 'fabric2' and 'fabric', reading '_version.py', reading 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'exec' to read version info, reading files for description and version, setting up package metadata, creating console script entry point.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package naming and entry point. Reading '_version.py' feeds version into setup. The console script executes 'program.run' within the package.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to evaluate '_version.py' content is a potential concern, though common in setup scripts; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup: checking environment variables and directories to determine package naming, reading version info via 'exec' from a local '_version.py' file, and reading a README for long description. The use of 'exec' is standard in setup scripts for version extraction, though it can be risky if the file content is malicious, which is unlikely in a trusted package repository context. No network activity, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious code is present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or access sensitive data beyond package configuration. It adheres to typical Python packaging patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The use of 'exec' is typical for reading version info in setup scripts but should be noted. Overall, the script is safe and does not pose security risks.",
