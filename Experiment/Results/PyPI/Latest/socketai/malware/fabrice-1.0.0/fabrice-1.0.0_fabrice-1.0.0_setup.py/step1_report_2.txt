{
  "purpose": "This script is used for setting up a Python package named 'fabrice', configuring dependencies, package discovery, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), reads the directory structure for 'fabric' and 'fabric2', reads the README.rst file, and reads the '_version.py' file within the package.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup to install dependencies and create entry points; reads version info and description from external files.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences package naming; directory structure check influences package name and binary name; reading '_version.py' reads version info; reading README.rst loads long description; setup parameters define installation behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution other than exec to read version info, which is standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: environment-based configuration, directory checks, reading version info, and setting up install_requires, extras_require, and entry points. The use of 'exec' to read version info is common in setup scripts and not malicious. No external network calls, no credential handling, and no suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It reads configuration data securely from files and environment variables, with no suspicious or anomalous code present.",
