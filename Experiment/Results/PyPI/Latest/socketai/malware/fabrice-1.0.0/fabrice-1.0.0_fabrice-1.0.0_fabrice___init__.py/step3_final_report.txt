  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, exposing internal modules and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only module imports with no dynamic execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; straightforward import pattern with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, typical for a package's __init__.py. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0, reflecting the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The current assessments are accurate; the security risk score should be adjusted to 0 for precision.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
