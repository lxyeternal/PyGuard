  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external data flows, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; purely module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes and variables from local modules. No dynamic code execution, input reading, or external data handling is present. The import statements are standard for Python packages and do not suggest malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module import list intended for exposing package interfaces. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks in this fragment.",
