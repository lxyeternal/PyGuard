  "purpose": "Extension of invoke and fabric classes to manage remote hosts and connections with dynamic parameters.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'hosts' and 'init_kwargs' used to configure connections; data read during task invocation.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of 'Connection' objects with potentially untrusted data; 'repr' exposing 'host' info.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'Connection' instantiation and 'repr' output, influencing connection setup and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; 'repr' exposes host info, which is minor.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of invoke/fabric for remote task execution, allowing dynamic configuration via parameters. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. The main security concern is that 'hosts' and 'init_kwargs' can be supplied externally without validation, potentially leading to connections to malicious hosts or configuration injection if inputs are malicious. No network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The code's structure and clarity indicate low likelihood of malicious intent, but unvalidated inputs could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functions as a standard extension for remote task management. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary security risk lies in unvalidated user inputs influencing connection parameters, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Proper validation should be implemented to mitigate this risk.",
