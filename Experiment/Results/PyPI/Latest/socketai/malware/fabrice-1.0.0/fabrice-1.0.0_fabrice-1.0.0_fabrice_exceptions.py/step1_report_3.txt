{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to task execution and environment issues.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; exceptions are instantiated based on program flow conditions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; exception classes are used internally within the application.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception objects may be raised but do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs; exception classes are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains simple custom exception classes with minimal logic, mainly for error handling. No external data input, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is standard and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of custom exception classes used for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
