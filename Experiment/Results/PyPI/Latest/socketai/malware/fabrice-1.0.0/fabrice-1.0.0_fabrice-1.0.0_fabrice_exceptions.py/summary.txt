  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception classes with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, malware likelihood is zero, and obfuscation is absent. The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature."
