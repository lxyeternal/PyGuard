  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes and does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "None; as the code contains only class definitions and no executable logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings, likely intended for error handling in a larger application. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The comments suggest possible future refactoring or relocation but do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be standard application code for handling specific error conditions.",
