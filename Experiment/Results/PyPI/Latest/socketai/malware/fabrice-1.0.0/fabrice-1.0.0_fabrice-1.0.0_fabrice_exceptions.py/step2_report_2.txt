  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings.\n   - No operational logic, data processing, or input/output handling is present.\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code appears benign and does not contain issues that would pose security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward exception class definitions.\n   - They accurately note the absence of data flow, external inputs, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n   - **Suggestion:** No adjustments needed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is purely structural, this is justified.\n   - No reason to elevate the risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign and purely structural.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Reasoning Summary:\nThe code is a standard, straightforward set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a Python project. It contains no operational logic, data processing, or security-sensitive operations. The reports are accurate and consistent in their assessments.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the current scores.**",
