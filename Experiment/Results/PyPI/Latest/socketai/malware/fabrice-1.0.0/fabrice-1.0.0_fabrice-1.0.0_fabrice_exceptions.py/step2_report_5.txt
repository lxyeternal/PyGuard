  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, logic, and security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No external data handling, no input/output operations, and no suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n- The comments and structure suggest these are part of a larger codebase, used for error handling.\n- No obfuscation, no embedded code, and no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code matches the descriptions; no issues are present.\n   - The exception classes are straightforward, with no errors or flaws in logic.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are accurate; they correctly state the benign nature of the code.\n   - No flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), consistent with the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are 0.\n   - This is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - Malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - No such claims are made; all reports correctly interpret the code as safe.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a set of simple exception class definitions.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is entirely benign, standard exception class definitions. No security concerns are present, and the scores assigned are appropriate.",
