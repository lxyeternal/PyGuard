  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes with descriptive docstrings.\n   - No operational logic, data processing, or external input/output.\n   - No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - Confirmed: No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, standard exception class definitions.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning detected.\n   - The assessments are appropriate and aligned with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1 or 1.0), reflecting certainty.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scoring seems reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a risk of 0, justified by the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n   - No need to increase scores; the reasoning is sound.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - Malware score of 0 across all reports is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No suspicious assumptions are made; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n   - The code is purely structural.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent internally and with the code.\n   - No discrepancies noted.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk or vulnerabilities)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
