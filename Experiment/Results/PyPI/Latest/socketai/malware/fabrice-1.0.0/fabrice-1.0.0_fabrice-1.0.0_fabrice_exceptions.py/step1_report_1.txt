{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for use in a larger Python project, primarily for handling specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external data input; class definitions and comments are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares exception classes without operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and conventional for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings. There are no functions, data processing, or security-sensitive operations present. No hardcoded secrets, input handling, or potentially malicious constructs are evident. The exception classes are typical and do not pose security risks. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions used for error handling. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. The implementation appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
