  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling related to group results and environment data.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code only declares exception classes without operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings. There are no operational functions, data processing, or external interactions. The classes are simple, with no embedded logic beyond storing a result object in GroupException. No data flow, input, or output is present. The code is standard, benign, and poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception classes with no malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, malware likelihood is zero, and obfuscation is absent. The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
