{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a larger Python project, possibly related to task execution or error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code only defines classes.",
  "targets": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class and exception definitions with no input/output processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of exception class definitions with docstrings and basic structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. All are standard exception subclasses with no embedded logic or data handling. There are no suspicious operations, no data leaks, and no malicious behaviors. The comments suggest a modular design for error handling, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage. No obfuscated code, external inputs, or potential attack vectors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely structural, serving to define custom exceptions for a larger application. It does not contain malware, security risks, or malicious behavior. It appears to be well-structured for standard exception handling purposes.",
