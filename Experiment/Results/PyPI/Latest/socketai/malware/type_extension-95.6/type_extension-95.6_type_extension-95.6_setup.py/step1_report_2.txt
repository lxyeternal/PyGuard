{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration and execute a custom installation routine that runs a function from the main module post-installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'from main import main', and the custom run method in CrazyInstallStrat class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' from the main module during installation process.",
  "flows": "Installation process invokes CrazyInstallStrat.run(), which then executes 'main()' from main module.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual to execute code ('main()') during setup install; 'main()' could contain malicious code, hidden behaviors, or backdoors, especially since it's invoked during install.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that runs a function called 'main()' from the 'main' module during installation. The nature of 'main()' is unknown, and executing code during installation can be risky if 'main()' contains malicious payloads or backdoors. The rest of the code appears standard for a setup script, but the invocation of external code during setup is suspicious and could be exploited to execute malicious code during package installation. No hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code are present in this snippet, but the indirect invocation warrants concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code attempts to run an external function ('main()') during package installation, which could potentially execute malicious code if 'main()' contains harmful logic. This behavior is unusual for standard setup scripts and should be reviewed further, especially examining the content of 'main.py'.",
