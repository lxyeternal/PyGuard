  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, as it can be exploited to run malicious code. The current reports recognize this risk, but the malware and risk scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the potential danger. Further review of 'main.py' is essential to determine actual malicious intent. Overall, this pattern is a red flag in supply chain security, and the package should be treated with high suspicion until verified safe."
