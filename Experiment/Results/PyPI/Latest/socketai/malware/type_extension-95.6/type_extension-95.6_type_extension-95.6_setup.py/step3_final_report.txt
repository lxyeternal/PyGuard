{
  "purpose": "The code executes a custom installation process that runs 'main()' from 'main.py' during package installation, which is unconventional and potentially risky.",
  "sources": "The import and execution of 'main()' in the 'run()' method of the custom 'CrazyInstallStrat' class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during setup, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if 'main()' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run()' method calls 'install.run(self)' and then imports and executes 'main()' from 'main', executing any code within 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external code ('main()') during setup without validation or sandboxing; pattern is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, after completing standard installation, imports and runs 'main()' from 'main.py'. This pattern is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during package installation, which can be exploited maliciously. The code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated, but the behavior of executing external code at install time is a red flag. The scores from reports vary, generally indicating moderate concern, but given the potential for malicious payloads, the malware score should be higher if 'main()' is untrusted. Without inspecting 'main.py', the risk cannot be definitively classified, but the pattern warrants high caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is a significant security concern, as it can be exploited to run malicious code. The current reports recognize this risk, but the malware and risk scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the potential danger. Further review of 'main.py' is essential to determine actual malicious intent. Overall, this pattern is a red flag in supply chain security, and the package should be treated with high suspicion until verified safe.",
