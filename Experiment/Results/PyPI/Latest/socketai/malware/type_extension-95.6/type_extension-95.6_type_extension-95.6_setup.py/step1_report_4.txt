{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a function from main.py upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, dependencies ('requests', 'psutil'), and executes 'main()' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' is a potential sink, especially if 'main()' contains malicious code, though the content of 'main()' is not provided.",
  "flows": "The flow is: during installation, the custom 'run' method invokes 'main()' from main.py, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes executing 'main()' during setup, which is not standard practice and could be exploited if 'main()' is malicious. No code obfuscation or hidden code is present. The class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' hints at malicious intent or a joke, but does not by itself indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that runs 'main()' from 'main.py' after installing the package. This behavior could be used to execute arbitrary code during package installation. The code itself does not contain malicious logic, but the execution of 'main()' at install time is potentially dangerous if 'main()' is malicious or compromised. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activities are evident in this snippet. The dependencies are common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the execution of 'main()' during installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main()' contains malicious code. Without inspecting 'main.py', we cannot confirm malicious intent, but the pattern itself is potentially risky.",
