  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data to multiple remote URLs encoded with Base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node() (hostname), getpass.getuser() (username), os.getcwd() (current directory), get_mac_addresses() (MAC addresses), random.randint() (rd_num)",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (sending data via GET requests to remote URLs)",
  "flows": "Collected data from sources (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses, rd_num) encoded and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, encoding MAC addresses with base64 possibly to obfuscate, no validation or filtering of inputs, silent exception handling, code collects sensitive system info and transmits it openly.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system info: hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded with base64, likely to obscure the data. It then constructs GET requests to three external URLs, passing the information as URL parameters. The URLs appear suspicious and potentially malicious, likely used for data exfiltration. The use of silent exception handling means failures in network requests won't raise alarms, further indicating possible malicious intent. No explicit malicious actions like system modification or malware are present, but the data collection and transmission pattern suggest tracking or reconnaissance activity, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects and transmits detailed system info to external domains, likely for tracking or data exfiltration. No evidence of malware payload or malicious code execution is present, but the behavior indicates potentially malicious data collection and exfiltration, warranting caution.",
