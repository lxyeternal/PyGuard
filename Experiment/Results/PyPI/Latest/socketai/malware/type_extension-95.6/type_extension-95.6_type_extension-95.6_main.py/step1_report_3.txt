  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to predefined external URLs with obfuscated MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (via get_mac_addresses()), and random number (random.randint()).",
  "sinks": "Makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs with collected parameters, potentially transmitting sensitive system info to third parties.",
  "flows": "System info sources are encoded, combined into URL parameters, and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation of MAC addresses using base64 encoding; the list of URLs points to suspicious, non-standard domains; no user consent or notification is present.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system-specific data such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses through platform-specific commands. It encodes the MAC addresses with base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters, including a random number. It then performs HTTP requests to potentially malicious or untrusted external domains without user consent or any indication. The use of external URLs, combined with the collection and transmission of system identifiers, suggests possible privacy violation or data exfiltration. No explicit malicious actions like damaging files or reverse shells are present, but the behavior indicates tracking or reconnaissance. The code does not obfuscate malicious intent explicitly but does obfuscate the MAC address data, which can be suspicious in a benign context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect and send system identification data to external, suspicious URLs, indicating potential privacy invasion or data exfiltration. While there is no evidence of destructive or malware-like behavior, the data transmission to untrusted domains is concerning. Overall, the script exhibits moderate malicious behavior potential related to privacy violations and possible covert data collection.",
