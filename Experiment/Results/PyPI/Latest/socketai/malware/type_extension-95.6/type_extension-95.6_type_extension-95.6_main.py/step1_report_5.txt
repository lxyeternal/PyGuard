  "purpose": "Collect system information (host name, user name, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system commands to get MAC addresses, random.randint() for generating a number, and base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP GET requests with embedded system info and encoded MAC addresses to external domains.",
  "flows": "System info collected from sources is encoded and embedded into URLs; these URLs are accessed via urlopen(), transmitting data to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs that appear suspicious and potentially malicious; encoding MAC addresses and system info before transmission; no response validation; exception handling that suppresses errors; no explicit user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host details including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses via system commands. MAC addresses are base64 encoded before inclusion. The data is sent via GET requests to three external URLs, which are suspicious domains that may be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. No data validation or encryption beyond base64 encoding is used. The code suppresses errors silently, which can hide failures or malicious activity. The use of random numbers in URL parameters may be for tracking or avoiding detection. Overall, the script appears to collect user and system data and transmit it to potentially malicious endpoints without explicit user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and transmitting it to suspicious external servers, likely for tracking or data theft. It employs encoding to obfuscate data but no strong encryption or user consent prompts are present. The script's intent aligns with malicious activity such as spyware or data exfiltration.",
