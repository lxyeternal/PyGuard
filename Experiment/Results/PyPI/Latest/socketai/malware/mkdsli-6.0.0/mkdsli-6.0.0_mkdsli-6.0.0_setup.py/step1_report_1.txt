{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package that, during installation, gathers system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() during the CustomInstall.run() method execution.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected system data to an external URL, potentially exposing user environment details to a remote server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source functions (hostname, cwd, username) directly into the requests.get() method, which transmits the data to an external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an external HTTP request during installation without any user consent or indication. The URL used is suspicious and could be malicious or used for data exfiltration. The URL appears to be a placeholder for a potentially malicious server (e.g., Burp Collaborator).",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setup process with a custom install command that, upon execution, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. Immediately after, it sends this information to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is unusual because it performs network communication during package installation without explicit user knowledge or consent, which could be used for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. The URL used is suspicious and resembles a testing or malicious server domain. No other malicious code or backdoors are present, but the external request during install is a privacy concern and could facilitate malicious activity if the URL were malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting system information and transmitting it during package installation to an external server. This behavior indicates a possible privacy violation or data exfiltration attempt. The URL used is suspicious and should be verified or removed. The code itself is otherwise straightforward and not obfuscated.",
