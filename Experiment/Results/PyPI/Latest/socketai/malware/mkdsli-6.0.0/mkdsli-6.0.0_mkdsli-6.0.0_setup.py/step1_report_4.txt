  "flows": "On installation, system info is collected and sent via requests.get to external server",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during installation, hardcoded URL, no user consent or control, no error handling or validation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during package installation, collects system hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to an external URL via an HTTP GET request without any user confirmation or safeguards. This behavior constitutes automatic data exfiltration, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The URL used appears to be a request repository or malicious domain placeholder, indicating possible tracking or malicious data collection. The code lacks any apparent legitimate purpose for this behavior, and it runs unconditionally on installation, raising significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration by sending system information to an external server during installation, without user consent. This behavior indicates malicious intent and poses a security risk.",
