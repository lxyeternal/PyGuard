  "purpose": "Package setup with custom installation behavior that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with constructed URL and parameters",
  "flows": "sources (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() call to remote URL",
  "anomalies": "The code collects system info and sends it to an external URL during installation without user consent, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom installation class that, during install, retrieves system hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (http://o2zel35m.requestrepo.com), potentially for tracking or malicious purposes. No input validation or user notification is present. The URL appears suspicious and could be used for malicious data collection. The rest of the setup code is standard, but the side effect during installation is abnormal and indicates possible malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent, indicating a high security risk. The code is suspicious and should not be trusted for production use.",
