{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, including a custom installation step that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends collected system data to an external server, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "Source: Collecting hostname, cwd, username -> Sink: Sending data via HTTP GET request to external domain.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without user consent during package installation, which is unusual for a standard setup script. The domain used for data collection appears suspicious and not related to the package's functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and third-party modules. A custom install class overrides the run method to gather system info (hostname, current working directory, username). Immediately after, it sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, which is suspicious behavior for a package installation script. There are no input validation, error handling, or user notifications, indicating potential malicious intent or covert tracking. The code's primary purpose seems to be to collect system info surreptitiously during installation. The external domain used is suspicious, hinting at malicious data collection or tracking. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft are present, but the exfiltration behavior is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and sending system information to a remote server during package installation without user consent. It is likely intended for tracking or data exfiltration purposes. The package should be considered suspicious and potentially harmful.",
