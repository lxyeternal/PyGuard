{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external URL",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) → requests.get() → external URL",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during installation without user consent, use of suspicious URL, no error handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during execution, gathers system environment details and sends them via a GET request to a suspicious domain. This occurs silently during package installation, representing covert data exfiltration. The URL appears malicious, and the behavior violates user privacy. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The network request lacks error handling, increasing suspicion. The behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration rather than benign telemetry, given the context and suspicious URL. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.75-0.9, security risk 0.75-0.9) are appropriate; the malware score could be slightly increased to 0.8, and the risk score to 0.9, reflecting the severity of silent data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert, unsolicited data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. The behavior is consistent across reports, and the scores reflect high security concern. The activity should be considered malicious, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
