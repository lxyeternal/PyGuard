  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or anomalies beyond standard import syntax.\n   - The code snippet itself does not perform any data processing, network activity, or code execution beyond importing a symbol.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly state that the code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for Python modules.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - Security risk scores are very low or zero, matching the minimal nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is just an import statement with no suspicious activity, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The scores assigned seem appropriate and justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent.\n   - This is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to analyzing the code snippet.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a straightforward relative import statement, typical in Python projects. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent in their evaluation.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current analysis and confirms that the code snippet is benign.",
