  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the import is static and does not involve data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward relative import with standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement: 'from .main import perm'. It does not involve dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, with malware and obfuscation scores of 0. The security risk scores are appropriately low (0 or near 0), reflecting no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's benign nature is consistent across all reports, and no further analysis of 'main' or 'perm' is possible from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is a standard, benign Python code snippet with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports and scores are consistent and appropriate, confirming the code's harmlessness.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
