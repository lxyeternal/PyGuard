  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .main import perm\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward relative import from a local module named `main`, importing an object or function called `perm`.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious constructs.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that this is a benign, standard import statement with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the import as standard, with no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.9 (this seems high), confidence=0.9\n- **Issue:** The securityRisk score is 0.9, implying high risk, but the reasoning states no anomalies or malicious behavior. This is inconsistent. Given the benign nature, a score of 0 or 0.1 would be more appropriate.\n- **Recommendation:** Lower the securityRisk to 0 or 0.1, aligning with the analysis.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states it's a simple import with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Comment:** The securityRisk is low, which is consistent with the analysis. Slightly above zero, perhaps to account for minimal inherent risk in any code, which is reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above, straightforward import, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Comment:** Fully consistent; no issues here.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly notes it's a standard import, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Comment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same conclusion, benign import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Comment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware Score Analysis:**\n- All reports correctly assign malware=0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n### **Obfuscated Score Analysis:**\n- All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct given the simplicity of the code.\n\n### **Risk Score Analysis:**\n- The only inconsistency is in Report 1, which assigns a high securityRisk (0.9) despite the analysis indicating no risk.\n- For all others, the scores are aligned with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Recommendations:**\n- **Adjust Report 1's securityRisk score:** It should be lowered to 0 or 0.1, matching the other reports and the analysis.\n- **Confirm the malware and obfuscated scores:** They are correctly assigned as 0.\n- **Potential for higher confidence:** Since all reports agree and the code is trivial, confidence can be set at 1 across the board.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very minimal, inherent risk in any code, but no actual threat)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence based on the consistent, benign analysis)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe import statement is standard Python code with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The only inconsistency is the high securityRisk score in Report 1, which should be lowered to reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to generate an updated consolidated report or further analysis.",
