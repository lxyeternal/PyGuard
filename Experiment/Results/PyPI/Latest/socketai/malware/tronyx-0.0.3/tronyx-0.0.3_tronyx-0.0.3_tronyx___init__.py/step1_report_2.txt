{
  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module from the current package or directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import flow involves loading 'main' and accessing its 'perm' attribute or function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, typical in Python packages. It references a local module '.main' and imports 'perm'. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or data leakage mechanisms. Since it is only an import statement, it cannot be evaluated for malicious behavior beyond verifying standard usage. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flow are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a Python package's structure.",
