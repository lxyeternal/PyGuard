  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module, likely for use elsewhere in the package or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.main'",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified in this single line",
  "flows": "No data flow present in this isolated import statement",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns such as obfuscation or hidden behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import from the 'main' module. It does not contain any code execution, data processing, or network activity. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no apparent malicious behavior. The minimal structure suggests a standard import statement, typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard import statement with no anomalies.",
