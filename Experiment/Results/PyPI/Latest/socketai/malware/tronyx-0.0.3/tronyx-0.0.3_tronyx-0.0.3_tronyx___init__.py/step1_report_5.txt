  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a module named 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports code from a local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified in this single line of import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a simple relative import from a local module named 'main'. It does not process any data, read external input, or perform actions that could be malicious. Since it only involves a single import statement, there are no evident security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The code appears to be part of a larger project, and without additional context, it cannot be evaluated for malicious intent beyond this line.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard Python code for module importing.",
