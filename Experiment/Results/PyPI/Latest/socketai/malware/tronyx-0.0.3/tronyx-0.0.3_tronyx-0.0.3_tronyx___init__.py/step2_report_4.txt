  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and typical for Python modules.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify that this is a simple import statement.\n   - They correctly state that, based solely on this line, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Confidence scores:** Mostly 0.9 or 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports, appropriate.\n   - **Malware:** 0 in all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - **Security risk:** Mostly 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate for such a benign import statement.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the lack of any suspicious activity, higher risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that, based on this line alone, there is no malicious behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided in each report.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk based on this line)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- While the import appears benign, the overall security posture depends on the content of the `main` module and how `perm` is used elsewhere.\n- If `perm` or `main` are maliciously crafted, the risk could be higher, but based solely on this import statement, there's no evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| Malware            | 0            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            |\n| Security Risk      | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard import statement with no malicious or security concerns evident from this snippet alone.",
