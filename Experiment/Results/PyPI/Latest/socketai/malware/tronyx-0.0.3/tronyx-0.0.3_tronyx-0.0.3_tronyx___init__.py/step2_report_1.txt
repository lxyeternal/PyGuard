  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .main import perm\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports agree that this is a straightforward import statement.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The code is minimal, standard Python syntax, importing `perm` from a local module `.main`.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors evident in this import statement.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the code as a standard import with no anomalies.\n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are present.\n\n**Step 3: Review scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Security risk scores are also 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), reflecting the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since this is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious activity, malware and risk scores should remain at 0.\n- Any higher score would be unjustified without additional context or code.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent; they recognize the code as benign.\n- No unwarranted assumptions are present.\n\n**Step 6: Ensure score consistency**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable assessments are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard relative import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The high confidence levels further support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
