  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'perm' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement importing 'perm' from a local module named 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. The import is a standard Python construct, and without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and typical for Python modules.",
