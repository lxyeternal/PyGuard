  "purpose": "Send private key data to an external API and retrieve a switcher status.",
  "sources": "The private_key parameter passed to the perm() function, and the switcher API response.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs, specifically the POST request transmitting transaction data containing private_key.",
  "flows": "The private_key is included in transaction_data, which is sent via POST request to an external API; then a GET request retrieves switcher status.",
  "anomalies": "The private key is stored in a set with a typo ('ptivat_key') instead of 'private_key'; the private key is sent over the network without encryption or validation; no validation of API responses; usage of external API to transmit sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function perm() that takes a private_key as input. It creates a set transaction_data containing the key with a typo 'ptivat_key', which suggests possible confusion or a mistake but not obfuscation. It then performs a POST request to an external URL, sending this set directly, which may lead to the transmission of sensitive information. The code then performs a GET request to check a switcher API endpoint and returns 1 if the JSON response is empty, otherwise 0. The data transmission involves private data without security measures, indicating a risk of data leakage. The typos and straightforward data flow suggest the code is designed to exfiltrate or misuse sensitive data, potentially maliciously. No obfuscation or malware-like activity such as backdoors or reverse shells is present, but the transmission of private key data to an external service is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code potentially leaks a private key by sending it over an unencrypted POST request to an external API. The misuse of the data, combined with the transmission of sensitive information, indicates malicious intent or at least a security risk. The typo in the data structure suggests a lack of professionalism or an error, but does not mitigate the risk. Overall, this code demonstrates significant security concerns related to privacy and data exfiltration.",
