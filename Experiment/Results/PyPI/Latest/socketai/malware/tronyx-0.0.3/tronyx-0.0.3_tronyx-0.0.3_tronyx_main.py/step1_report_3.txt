{
  "purpose": "The code appears to send transaction data containing a private key to a remote API and then checks a switcher endpoint for some condition.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'private_key' parameter passed to the perm function.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to an external API endpoint via requests.post and requests.get, potentially leaking sensitive data.",
  "flows": "private_key (source) -> transaction_data -> requests.post (to external API) -> switcher.json() -> return value",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URL with no validation or encryption, sending private key directly over the network, possible lack of secure transmission, and suspicious use of a 'switcher' endpoint.",
  "analysis": "The function 'perm' takes a private key as input and includes it in a data structure sent via POST request to an external URL, which could leak sensitive information. The data structure has a typo ('ptivat_key' instead of 'private_key'), but this does not affect the transmission. It then performs a GET request to another endpoint and uses the response to determine the return value. There is no evidence of malicious code execution or obfuscated logic. However, the code's behavior of transmitting private data without apparent encryption or validation poses a security risk. The hardcoded API URL is suspicious, and the code potentially leaks private keys to an external server, which could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code sends a private key to an external server without security measures, posing a significant risk of data leakage. While there is no explicit malware, the intentional transmission of sensitive data suggests malicious intent or at least unsafe handling of credentials.",
