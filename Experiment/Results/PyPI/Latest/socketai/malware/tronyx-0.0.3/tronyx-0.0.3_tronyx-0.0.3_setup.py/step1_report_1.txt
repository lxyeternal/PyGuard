  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'tronyx' Python package including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, and importing setup, find_packages, Path modules for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system calls that could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md content as a string; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of external dependencies is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup with metadata, dependencies, and description. It reads a local README.md file to include a long description, which is typical for Python packages. No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data sources are involved. The code structure is straightforward and conforms to common practices. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
