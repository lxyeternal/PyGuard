  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'tronyx' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; static strings in setup configuration; dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "None present. No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic behaviors. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard packaging libraries, reads a local README file for the long description, and defines package metadata such as name, version, author info, and dependencies. The setup parameters are static and conventional. The only external link is a GitHub repository URL, which is benign and typical for open-source packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious code or security risks. The code performs typical package setup operations without any anomalies or suspicious activity.",
