  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'tronyx', defining package metadata, dependencies, and repository info.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; hardcoded strings for package metadata and URLs.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input are present in this script.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, reads a README file for package description, and defines package metadata including name, version, dependencies, author info, and repository URL. The code follows standard Python packaging conventions without obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No external input or untrusted data processing is involved, and no network or runtime malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs typical package setup tasks without any suspicious or malicious code. Overall, it appears safe.",
