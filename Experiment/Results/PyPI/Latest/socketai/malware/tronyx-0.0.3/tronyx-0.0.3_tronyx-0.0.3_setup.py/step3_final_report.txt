  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'tronyx' Python library, reading README.md for long description, and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; no untrusted input sources; static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script using setuptools. It reads a local README.md file, defines package info, dependencies, author details, and repository URL. No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data sources are involved. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All external URLs are typical for open-source projects. The code structure and content are consistent with benign packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
