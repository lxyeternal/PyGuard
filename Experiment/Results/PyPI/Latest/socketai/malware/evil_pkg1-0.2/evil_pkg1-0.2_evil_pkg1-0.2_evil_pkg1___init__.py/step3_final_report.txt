  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on code patterns such as eval, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and suspicious data flows.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network or file operations, data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, dynamic code execution, or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials or secrets, obfuscated code, suspicious strings or data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical data processing patterns with no suspicious activity in most reports. Report 3 explicitly mentions hardcoded secrets, eval/exec, and suspicious strings, indicating high malicious potential. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 show benign patterns with no anomalies. The scores reflect these observations: Report 3's malware score (0.65) and obfuscation (0.4) are justified by the suspicious patterns; others are low. Confidence levels align with the evidence provided. The overall assessment confirms that most code is benign, with Report 3 warranting further scrutiny due to its high risk indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3 presents significant suspicious patterns justifying higher malware (0.65) and risk (0.75) scores. The scores are consistent with the described code behaviors. Minor adjustments could be made if additional context reveals more obfuscation or malicious activity, but current scores are appropriate.",
