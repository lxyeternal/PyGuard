  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3 presents significant suspicious patterns justifying higher malware (0.65) and risk (0.75) scores. The scores are consistent with the described code behaviors. Minor adjustments could be made if additional context reveals more obfuscation or malicious activity, but current scores are appropriate."
