{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on code analysis, data flow, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, environment variables, network data, user inputs, and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variables, system commands, and data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network transmission or file storage, potentially revealing malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network connections, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either absent or benign, with no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The confidence levels are moderate to high based on the available context. No malicious indicators or vulnerabilities are identified. The security risk scores are low, reflecting cautious optimism given incomplete information. Overall, the code appears safe, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
