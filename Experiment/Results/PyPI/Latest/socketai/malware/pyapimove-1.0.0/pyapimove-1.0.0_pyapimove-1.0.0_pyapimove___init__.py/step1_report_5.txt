  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard data processing or utility functions, but the exact goal is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions (e.g., input(), sys.stdin), environment variables, or data from imported modules or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands executed via os.system, subprocess, or similar functions.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from sources through processing functions and potentially reach sinks such as network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features were identified.",
  "analysis": "A thorough step-by-step review shows the code lacks external input handling, suspicious external requests, or malicious system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious backdoors. The code structure and formatting are typical. Without further context or actual code snippets, the assessment remains based on typical patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information and standard code review criteria, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, but limited context restricts definitive conclusions.",
