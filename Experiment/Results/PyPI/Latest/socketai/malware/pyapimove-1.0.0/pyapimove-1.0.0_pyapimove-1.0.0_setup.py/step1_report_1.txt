  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the Python project 'pyapimove'.",
  "sources": "None (the code only uses static data and function calls from setuptools).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data or input is processed or output).",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code does not handle data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. It specifies basic project information such as name, version, description, author, and classifiers. The code appears to be a standard setup script with no dynamic code execution, external data input, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present. All data used is static, and the code follows typical Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
