  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyapimove'.",
  "sources": "Module imports from setuptools, package discovery with find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Imports and setup parameters flow normally without external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata. It imports necessary modules, specifies package details such as name, version, description, author info, classifiers, and Python version requirements. No external inputs, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. All elements are typical for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
