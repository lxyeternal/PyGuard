  "purpose": "This code is intended to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'pyapimove'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and email.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; the code does not process external input or data streams.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely sets up package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, using standard setuptools functions without obfuscation or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools and calls 'setup' with static metadata parameters. There are no dynamic or external data sources involved. The package information appears legitimate and typical for Python packages. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior are present. The code follows standard practices for Python packaging, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
