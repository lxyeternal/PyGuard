  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pyapimove'.",
  "sources": "Code imports from setuptools, specifically setup() and find_packages(). No external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks since the code solely defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines package metadata, and calls setup() with standard parameters. All fields are typical for a Python package distribution, including name, version, packages, description, author info, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, environment variable use, or other suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup script for packaging a Python module named 'pyapimove'. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
