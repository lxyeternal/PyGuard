  "purpose": "This setup script defines package metadata for a Python project named 'pyapimove' using setuptools. It specifies package info, author details, classifiers, and Python version requirements, serving as configuration for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call: name, version, description, author, classifiers, and find_packages() function call.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools, with static metadata and package discovery. No dynamic or external inputs are involved. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The email address appears placeholder but not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
