  "review": "Let's analyze the provided setup script and the associated reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Review:**\n- The code is a standard Python `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n- It imports `setup` and `find_packages` from `setuptools`.\n- It defines package metadata: name (`pyapimove`), version (`1.0.0`), description, author info, classifiers, and Python requirement (`>=3.6`).\n- It calls `find_packages()` to automatically discover packages.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or sensitive operations are present.\n- The code appears to be a typical, benign setup script with static data.\n\n**2. Logical and Security Flaws:**\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n- The email address (`sjsbcaksgg.s.ksv@gmail.com`) appears arbitrary but not malicious.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- They assign:\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- The confidence score is 1 in all reports, indicating high certainty.\n\n**4. Scoring Justification:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is straightforward, the scores seem appropriate.\n- No report suggests any potential vulnerability, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The risk score of 0 aligns with the absence of security concerns.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified given no malicious behavior.\n\n**5. Additional Considerations:**\n- The email address could be scrutinized, but in absence of any malicious activity, it is likely just placeholder or generic contact info.\n- The code's simplicity and static nature further reduce suspicion.\n\n**6. Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**7. My Expert Estimate:**\nGiven all the above, I concur with the reports' assessments. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical, benign Python setup script.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nand consider the package safe based on this review.",
