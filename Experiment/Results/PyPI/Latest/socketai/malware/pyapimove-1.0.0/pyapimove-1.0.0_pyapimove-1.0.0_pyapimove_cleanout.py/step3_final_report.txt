{
  "purpose": "The code searches for 'Telegram Desktop' folders across drives C-G, collects specific files excluding known safe files, compresses them, and uploads the archive to a hardcoded external IP address, likely for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Filesystem traversal on drives C-G, reading environment variables for TEMP directory, network GET request to retrieve directory ID, and reading files from targeted folders.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to upload the compressed archive to a remote IP, reading environment variables, and file system operations for copying and deleting files.",
  "flows": "Filesystem scan -> file filtering -> copying files to temp directory -> compressing files -> uploading via network -> cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address, no user prompts or consent, stealthy activity targeting specific user directories, silent error handling, broad drive scanning, and external data transmission without notification.",
  "analysis": "The script searches multiple drives for 'Telegram Desktop' folders, verifies the presence of 'Telegram.exe', filters out certain files, copies relevant files into a temporary directory, compresses them into a ZIP archive, and exfiltrates the data by POST request to a hardcoded IP. It retrieves a directory number from the server response to organize uploads. The code operates silently, with no user interaction, and handles errors quietly. The use of a fixed IP and targeted folder scanning strongly indicates malicious intent, typical of data theft or spyware activities. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex techniques, but its behavior aligns with covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior characteristic of data exfiltration malware, targeting user data from Telegram Desktop folders, compressing, and sending it to an external server without user consent. The presence of a hardcoded IP, stealthy operation, and targeted data collection confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk and malware scores are justified as high, with a malware likelihood close to 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, so the obfuscation score remains 0.",
