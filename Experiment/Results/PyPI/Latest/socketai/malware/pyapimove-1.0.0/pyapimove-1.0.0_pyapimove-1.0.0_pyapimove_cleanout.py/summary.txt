  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior characteristic of data exfiltration malware, targeting user data from Telegram Desktop folders, compressing, and sending it to an external server without user consent. The presence of a hardcoded IP, stealthy operation, and targeted data collection confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk and malware scores are justified as high, with a malware likelihood close to 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, so the obfuscation score remains 0."
