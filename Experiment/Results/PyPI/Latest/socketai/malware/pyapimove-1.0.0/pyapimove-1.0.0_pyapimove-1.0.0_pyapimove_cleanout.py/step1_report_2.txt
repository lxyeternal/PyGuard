{
  "purpose": "The code appears to search for specific folders named 'Telegram Desktop' across multiple drives, compress their contents excluding certain files and directories, and upload the resulting archive to an external server.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the environment variable 'TEMP', the file system (searching drives for specific folders and files), and external HTTP responses (for getting existing directory numbers).",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks are the HTTP POST request that uploads the zip archive to a remote server, and the GET request to retrieve existing directory numbers from the server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file system reads (searching drives, reading files) into the local temporary directory; then the compressed archive is sent via HTTP POST to the specified server. The flow of data includes reading files, compressing, and uploading without validation or user consent.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically searches for specific folders on multiple drives, compresses their contents, and uploads to an external IP address without user interaction or notification. The target IP is hardcoded, and the code skips certain files, possibly to hide or exclude specific data. No logging or user prompts are present. The server IP '77.91.76.45' appears suspicious and not related to typical usage of Telegram.",
  "analysis": "The script searches across system drives for folders named 'Telegram Desktop' and checks for the presence of 'Telegram.exe'. When found, it copies files from these folders (excluding certain files/directories), compresses them, and uploads the archive to a hardcoded external server IP. The process includes determining a directory number by querying the server, suggesting a command-and-control or data exfiltration pattern. The use of environment variables, folder searches, and network communication without user consent or logging indicates potential malicious intent. The code does not perform any validation, encryption, or user interaction, and the external server address is suspicious. Overall, it behaves like a data collection and exfiltration script targeting specific user data, likely malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized scanning of user directories, collects data related to Telegram folders, compresses and exfiltrates this data to an external server without user consent. It has characteristics typical of malware used for data theft or covert monitoring. The hardcoded server IP and aggressive folder search patterns raise significant security concerns.",
