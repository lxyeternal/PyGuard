{
  "purpose": "The code searches for specific folders named 'Telegram Desktop' across drives, collects files excluding certain types, compresses and uploads them to a remote server, potentially for data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('TEMP'), filesystem (searches drives for folders and files), and performs HTTP GET and POST requests to a remote IP address.",
  "sinks": "Uploads compressed data via HTTP POST to an external IP address. Reads and copies files from user directories.",
  "flows": "Filesystem search → file copying to temp directory → compression → HTTP POST upload. The URL used for upload is retrieved from a fixed remote server response, and the collected data is sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address and URL, excessive exclusion of user data directories, collection of potentially sensitive files, no explicit user consent, attempts to hide or obfuscate data collection activities. No clear purpose is provided, and the code operates stealthily.",
  "analysis": "The script scans multiple drives for 'Telegram Desktop' folders, then collects all files except specified ones, copies them into a temporary directory, compresses the data, and uploads it to a remote server. The remote server's response determines the directory number used in data submission. The process involves network communication with a suspicious IP address, which indicates potential data exfiltration. The code avoids processing certain files, likely to hide its activity. No user prompts or logs are present. The URL and IP address are hardcoded, and the activity resembles data harvesting with covert upload behavior, characteristic of malicious or unauthorized data exfiltration tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears malicious, primarily designed to exfiltrate files from user directories without consent, using stealthy file collection, compression, and network transfer to an external IP address. The approach and behaviors align with typical data theft or espionage tools.",
