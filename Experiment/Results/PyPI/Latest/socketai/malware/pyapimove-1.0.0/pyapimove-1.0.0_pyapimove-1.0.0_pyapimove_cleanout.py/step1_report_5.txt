{
  "purpose": "The script searches for specific folders named 'Telegram Desktop' across multiple drives, copies files excluding certain known files and directories, compresses the copied files, and uploads the archive to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('TEMP'), filesystem directories ('C:', 'D:', 'E:', etc.), and files within 'Telegram Desktop' folders that contain 'Telegram.exe'. It also reads the archive file for uploading.",
  "sinks": "Uploads data via HTTP POST to a remote IP address. Reads the archive file for transmission.",
  "flows": "The code copies files from identified folders, compresses them into a ZIP archive, then transmits the archive over HTTP POST to the specified IP address. It retrieves a directory number from a remote server before uploading.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded IP address and URL for uploading data; searches across multiple drives for specific folder names; suppresses errors silently; performs network activity and file operations potentially without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script systematically searches drives for specific folders, copies files excluding certain known safe files, compresses the data, and uploads it to a remote server. The IP address and URL suggest remote data transmission. No code injection, obfuscation, or encryption is present. The silent error handling and network activity without clear user context are suspicious. The behavior resembles data collection or exfiltration, especially given the broad drive scanning and uploading of potentially sensitive files.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears designed to collect files from 'Telegram Desktop' folders across multiple drives, compress, and upload them to a remote server, which could be malicious or violate user privacy. No direct malicious payload (e.g., executing unknown code, reverse shells) is evident, but its behavior raises security concerns due to data exfiltration potential.",
