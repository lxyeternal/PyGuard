{
  "purpose": "The script searches for specific Telegram Desktop folders across drives, copies their contents excluding certain files and directories, compresses the data, and uploads it to a remote server. It appears designed to gather and exfiltrate user data.",
  "sources": "Environment variable TEMP for temporary directory; filesystem traversal of drives C-G; reading files in Telegram Desktop folders; reading archive files for upload; HTTP GET request to determine directory naming; reading local files for compression.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request sending the compressed archive to a remote IP; reading local files to include in archive; deletion of files and directories; network communication with external IP (77.91.76.45).",
  "flows": "Filesystem data from Telegram folders is copied into a temporary directory, compressed, and then sent over HTTP POST to the external server. The get_next_dir_num function retrieves server response to determine directory naming, influencing the data sent.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address for data exfiltration; behavior designed to locate Telegram Desktop folders without user consent; automatic network communication without user interaction; no user prompts; attempts to evade detection by excluding specific files; aggressive deletion of temp files after use.",
  "analysis": "The code searches for Telegram Desktop directories across drives C-G, indicating targeted data collection. It filters out certain files and directories, then copies remaining files to a temporary directory. The temp directory is compressed into a ZIP archive. The script retrieves a number from a remote URL to determine an identifier, then uploads the ZIP archive to that server via HTTP POST. It cleans up temporary files after completion. The use of hardcoded IP address and automatic data exfiltration strongly suggest malicious intent, aiming to stealthily harvest user data without consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to locate, collect, and exfiltrate user data from Telegram Desktop folders across multiple drives, communicating with an external IP address. Its behavior indicates malicious intent, primarily data theft and covert communication, with no legitimate user benefit.",
