{
  "purpose": "Define a custom installation process that gathers system information and sends it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() used to gather hostname, current directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() used to send data to a remote URL.",
  "flows": "System info is collected from sources and sent via HTTP GET request to the specified domain during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends sensitive system information to an external domain without user consent; the domain appears suspicious; no user warning or permission check.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools installation process with a custom run method. During installation, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a domain that appears suspicious and unrelated to the package purpose, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The data collection occurs automatically during package install, with no indication to the user. There are no obfuscation or malicious payloads, but the behavior indicates possible privacy invasion or malicious activity. The domain is suspicious, and the request is made without any user notice or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized collection and transmission of system information to a suspicious external domain during package installation, indicating malicious intent or privacy invasion. The behavior is highly suspicious and could be used for tracking or data theft.",
