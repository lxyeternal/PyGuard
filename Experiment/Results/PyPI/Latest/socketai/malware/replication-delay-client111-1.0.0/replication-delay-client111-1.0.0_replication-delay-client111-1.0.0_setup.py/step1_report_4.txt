{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process to perform additional actions during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install run method.",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain, which could leak sensitive information.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) is gathered and then sent to an external server through a network request.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unsolicited network request to an external domain during installation without any user notification or consent. The domain is obfuscated (non-descriptive), and the URL does not correspond to a legitimate or well-known service.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard setup process to include a network call that transmits system details. The information sent includes hostname, current working directory, and username, which can be sensitive data. The request to an obscure domain suggests potential malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or tracking, especially since it occurs automatically during package installation without any user awareness. There are no clear safeguards or obfuscation techniques, and the purpose of this network activity is not disclosed. The code does not perform any other malicious actions but the behavior raises privacy and security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code attempts to collect and transmit system information to an external server during package installation without user consent, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. The activity is hidden within the setup process, which is suspicious.",
