  "purpose": "Collects system information (hostname, current directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates it to a suspicious external domain.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",

  "flows": "source functions (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() with parameters",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during setup without user notification or consent; transmission to a suspicious, obfuscated domain",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a custom install class that, after executing the normal installation, gathers system info and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. The behavior occurs during package setup, which is unusual and indicates malicious intent. The URL used is suspicious and unrelated to the package purpose. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The data exfiltration is covert, and no user notification is present. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0) are justified given the behavior. The activity aligns with malicious data theft or tracking, with high confidence and no false positives. The overall conclusion is that the code is malicious, performing covert data exfiltration during installation, warranting high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to a suspicious domain during package installation. The activity is covert and privacy-invasive, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The reports correctly identify this behavior, and their scoring is appropriate. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
