{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()) during installation.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (requests.get).",
  "flows": "During installation, system info is gathered and transmitted to the specified URL, potentially exposing sensitive user and system details.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information to an external server during package installation without any user consent or clear purpose. The domain used appears suspicious and could be malicious or tracking-related. The code executes network activity during install, which is uncommon and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines a custom install class. In the run method, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then immediately sends this data to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. This occurs automatically during package installation, which is abnormal and could be malicious. The domain 'c61vv1m2vtc00009mdj0gdy77oayyyyyb.interactsh.com' appears intentionally obfuscated or suspicious, and sending user system info without disclosure indicates malicious intent or tracking. The code does not sanitize or validate data before transmission, and the network activity is embedded in the setup process, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external, suspicious domain. This indicates an attempt to gather user data covertly. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be considered unsafe.",
