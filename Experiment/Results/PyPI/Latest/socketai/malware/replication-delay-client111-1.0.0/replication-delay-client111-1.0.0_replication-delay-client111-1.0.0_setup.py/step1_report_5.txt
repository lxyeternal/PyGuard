  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()), during the CustomInstall.run() method execution.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to send data to the specified remote server 'c61vv1m2vtc00009mdj0gdy77oayyyyyb.interactsh.com'.",
  "flows": "Data collected (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source variables to the requests.get() method, which transmits this information to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects environment and system data and transmits it without user consent, during the package installation process, which is unusual behavior for a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for setup and system info collection, then defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. After executing the standard install, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote URL. This behavior indicates data exfiltration during installation, which is suspicious and not typical for legitimate package setup scripts. No user prompts or notices are present, and the data collection is hidden within the install process, suggesting malicious intent or at least privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code conducts covert data collection and exfiltration during package installation, which is malicious behavior and poses a security and privacy risk. It should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
