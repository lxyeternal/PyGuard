{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and customizes the installation process to send system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the installation process.",
  "sinks": "The code makes an HTTP GET request to an external domain with system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "During the custom install, the source data (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get call which transmits this data to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and unrelated to the package name or description; the transmission occurs during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The URL domain looks malicious or at least suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and additional modules: requests for HTTP requests, socket for hostname, getpass for username, and os for current working directory. It defines a CustomInstall class that extends the install command, overriding the run method. After executing the standard installation, it collects system info: hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this info via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious domain. The domain 'c61vv1m2vtc00009mdj0gdy77oayyyyyb.interactsh.com' resembles a command-and-control or malicious exfiltration endpoint. Sending system data at install time without user consent indicates potentially malicious behavior, possibly for tracking or data theft. The code does not include obfuscation or complex tricks but does perform data exfiltration in an unusual context (during install).",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate package setup functions but includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during installation. This indicates a likely malicious intent or security risk, as it violates typical user expectations and privacy norms.",
