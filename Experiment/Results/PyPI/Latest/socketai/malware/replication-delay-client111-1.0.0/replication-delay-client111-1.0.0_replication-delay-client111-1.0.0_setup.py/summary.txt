  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to a suspicious domain during package installation. The activity is covert and privacy-invasive, justifying high malware and security risk scores. The reports correctly identify this behavior, and their scoring is appropriate. The package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious."
