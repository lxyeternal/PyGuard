{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'datagov-harvester' Python project.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as 'long_description' reading 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data output or sensitive data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code primarily sets configuration for package distribution without data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The 'long_description' reads from 'README.md' without input validation, but this is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing setuptools and configuring package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads the long description from a README file, which is common. No dynamic execution, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed. No external data sources or sinks identified. The package appears to be intended for system information collection, but the code itself does not perform any data collection or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows common packaging practices without suspicious or malicious elements.",
