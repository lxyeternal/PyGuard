  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code or network activity.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependencies are static; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Reads 'README.md' without error handling; no active data collection or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It reads a local file for description without validation, which is common but minor. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The description mentioning 'System information collection' is only metadata, not active collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python packaging, with no indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight risk score reflects minimal potential error in file handling but does not imply security issues.",
