{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'datagov-harvester'.",
  "sources": "Read from 'README.md' for long_description, environment variables for setup parameters (not explicitly used), and package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the content of 'README.md' read into long_description (if malicious content is included), but no data is transmitted or executed.",
  "flows": "Read 'README.md' -> assign content to long_description; dependencies are installed via package manager during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without error handling can be risky if file is missing or manipulated; however, this is common in setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no external network calls or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, utilizing setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. No code execution beyond reading a README file occurs. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The only minor concern is the unprotected read of 'README.md' which could cause an error if the file is missing, but this is typical in setup scripts and not malicious. No external or untrusted data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical packaging tasks without suspicious activity.",
