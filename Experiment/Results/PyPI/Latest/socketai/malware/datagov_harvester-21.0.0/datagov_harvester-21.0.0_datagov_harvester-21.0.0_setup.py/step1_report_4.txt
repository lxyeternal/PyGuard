  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'datagov-harvester'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including read() from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or sensitive information leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content as 'long_description' during setup; no other data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read a local file directly in the setup() call; no validation or exception handling; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration options. The only potentially unusual element is reading the 'README.md' file directly during setup, which is common but could cause errors if the file is missing. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activities. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The code appears to be straightforward and typical for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply reads a local file for documentation purposes and sets package metadata. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
