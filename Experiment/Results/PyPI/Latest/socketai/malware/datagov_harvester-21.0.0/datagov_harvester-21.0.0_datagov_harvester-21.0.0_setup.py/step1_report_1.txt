{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'datagov-harvester' Python package.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the package metadata, version info, and the README.md file.",
  "sinks": "Installation process and package metadata, no direct sinks of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependencies are processed during package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The package description states 'System information collection package,' which could imply data collection. The use of 'long_description' reading from README.md is standard. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion. There are no dynamic code execution, input validation, or suspicious behaviors. The description hints at system information collection, but this is common in package metadata and does not indicate malicious activity by itself. No anomalous code structures, obfuscated parts, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious intent. The only potential concern is the description implying system information collection, but there is no active collection or data handling code within this script.",
