      "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates potential covert data exfiltration via hooks on standard module operations. While not definitively malicious, it is suspicious enough to warrant caution. The scores should reflect moderate malware suspicion (~0.4-0.5) and a high security risk (~0.55-0.65). Further investigation into _collect_and_send() is recommended to confirm whether data is transmitted maliciously."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign system info collector with potential privacy concerns due to unsolicited data transmission. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The high malware scores assigned in some reports are unjustified; a more accurate assessment would assign a low malware score (~0.1-0.2), a zero obfuscation score, and a moderate security risk (~0.3-0.4) reflecting privacy invasion potential. Overall, the code's behavior is passive and not inherently malicious, but deployment without user consent could be considered unethical or privacy-invasive."
