  "purpose": "The code initializes a system data collector upon module import and sets up hooks for attribute access and directory listing to trigger data collection.",
  "sources": "Import statement for SystemCollector, module import, attribute access via __getattr__, and __dir__ function calls.",
  "sinks": "Calls to _collector._collect_and_send() potentially send collected data to an external endpoint or storage, especially when attributes are accessed or directory listing occurs.",
  "flows": "On module import, SystemCollector is instantiated. Any attribute access triggers __getattr__, which calls _collect_and_send(). Similarly, calling __dir__() also triggers _collect_and_send().",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of __getattr__ and __dir__ to automatically collect and send data on attribute access and directory listing, which can be used for persistent data collection or stealthy behavior. Lack of visibility into what _collect_and_send() does raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a collector class and instantiates it immediately, suggesting data collection upon import. The __getattr__ and __dir__ methods are overridden to invoke the collection method _collect_and_send(), which implies that any attribute access or directory listing will trigger data collection and possibly transmission. This behavior can be benign if used for diagnostics but can also be exploited for stealthy data exfiltration or surveillance. There are no hardcoded credentials or explicit malicious commands, but the pattern of automatic data collection on attribute access is unusual and potentially suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to automatically collect data whenever the module's attributes are accessed or when directory listing is performed. This pattern can be legitimate for telemetry or diagnostics, but it also bears the risk of covert data collection. Without further context on _collect_and_send(), it is difficult to determine malicious intent definitively. Overall, this code exhibits suspicious behavior related to automatic data collection triggers.",
