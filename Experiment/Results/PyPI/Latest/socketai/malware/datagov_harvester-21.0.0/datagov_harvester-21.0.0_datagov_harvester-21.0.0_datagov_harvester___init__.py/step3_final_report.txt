  "purpose": "Detects and potentially exfiltrates data by invoking _collect_and_send() during attribute access and directory listing, possibly for covert data collection or malicious monitoring.",
  "sources": "Attribute access (__getattr__), directory listing (__dir__)",
  "sinks": "_collect_and_send() potentially transmitting data externally",
  "flows": "On attribute access or dir() call, triggers _collect_and_send() which may send data",
  "anomalies": "Automatic invocation of data collection during standard module interactions; no implementation details of _collect_and_send() provided",
  "analysis": "The code imports a SystemCollector, initializes it at import, and overrides __getattr__ and __dir__ to call _collect_and_send() before raising AttributeError or returning an empty list. This pattern suggests the module is designed to collect data covertly during normal operations. The suspicious pattern is consistent across reports, with scores indicating moderate suspicion. The actual maliciousness depends on the implementation of _collect_and_send(), which is not provided. The scores assigned (malware ~0.4-0.5, security risk ~0.55-0.65) are appropriate given the pattern of automatic data collection triggered during common module interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates potential covert data exfiltration via hooks on standard module operations. While not definitively malicious, it is suspicious enough to warrant caution. The scores should reflect moderate malware suspicion (~0.4-0.5) and a high security risk (~0.55-0.65). Further investigation into _collect_and_send() is recommended to confirm whether data is transmitted maliciously.",
