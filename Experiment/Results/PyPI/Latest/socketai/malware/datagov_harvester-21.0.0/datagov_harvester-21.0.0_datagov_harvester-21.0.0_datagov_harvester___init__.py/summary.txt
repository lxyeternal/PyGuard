  "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates potential covert data exfiltration via hooks on standard module operations. While not definitively malicious, it is suspicious enough to warrant caution. The scores should reflect moderate malware suspicion (~0.4-0.5) and a high security risk (~0.55-0.65). Further investigation into _collect_and_send() is recommended to confirm whether data is transmitted maliciously."
