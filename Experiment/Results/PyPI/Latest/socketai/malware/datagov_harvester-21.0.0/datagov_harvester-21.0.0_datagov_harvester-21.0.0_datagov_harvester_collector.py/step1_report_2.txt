{
  "purpose": "Collects system and network information and sends it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, network addresses, platform details, and installation path; generating UUID.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to the webhook URL with collected data.",
  "flows": "System info collected via internal methods and sent through requests.post to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the code automatically collects extensive system and network information without user consent. No evident obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system hostname, IP addresses, domain names, platform info, and installation path, then sends this data to a specified webhook URL. The URL appears to be a placeholder (https://webhook.site/gsa). No credentials, encryption, or sensitive data are explicitly collected besides system info. The URL is hardcoded, which could be misused if replaced with malicious endpoints. The code does not contain malicious payloads, reverse shells, or data exfiltration of sensitive info like environment variables or files. Overall, it functions as a system info collector with a potential privacy concern due to unsolicited data transmission, but no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a system information collector that sends data to a webhook. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is privacy and unsolicited data transmission rather than malicious activity.",
