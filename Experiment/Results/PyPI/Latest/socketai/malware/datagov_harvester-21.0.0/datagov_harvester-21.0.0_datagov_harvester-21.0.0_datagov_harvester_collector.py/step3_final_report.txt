  "anomalies": [

    "Immediate data exfiltration upon instantiation without user consent",
    "No obfuscation or code injection",
    "Extensive network reconnaissance (reverse DNS lookups)"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs passive collection of system and network information, including hostname, IP addresses, domain names, platform details, and a UUID, then transmits this data to a fixed webhook URL. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or active exploits. The data collection is straightforward and does not modify system state. The primary concern is privacy invasion and potential misuse for covert data exfiltration. The high malware score in some reports (e.g., 0.7) overstates the actual risk, as the code itself is benign. The scores should reflect the passive nature of data collection and privacy implications rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign system info collector with potential privacy concerns due to unsolicited data transmission. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The high malware scores assigned in some reports are unjustified; a more accurate assessment would assign a low malware score (~0.1-0.2), a zero obfuscation score, and a moderate security risk (~0.3-0.4) reflecting privacy invasion potential. Overall, the code's behavior is passive and not inherently malicious, but deployment without user consent could be considered unethical or privacy-invasive.",
