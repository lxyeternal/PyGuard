  "purpose": "Collect system and network information and send it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, network addresses, system platform details, install path, and generates a UUID.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to a webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> gathers domain/IP info -> sends data via requests.post() to webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL, which may be used to exfiltrate data. No input validation or obfuscation. No user prompts or environment variable usage for sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers detailed system and network info, including hostnames, IP addresses, and platform details, then sends this data to a remote webhook. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL could facilitate data exfiltration. There are no signs of malicious code such as reverse shells, data theft from clipboard, or system modification. The data collection appears to be passive, intended for monitoring or tracking purposes. No suspicious obfuscation or unusual dynamic execution observed. The code does not perform any malicious activity or exploit system vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is primarily a system information collector that sends data to a specified webhook. It could be used legitimately for monitoring or debugging but also has potential for misuse if deployed without user consent, especially considering the hardcoded webhook. There are no clear signs of malware or malicious intent within this code fragment.",
