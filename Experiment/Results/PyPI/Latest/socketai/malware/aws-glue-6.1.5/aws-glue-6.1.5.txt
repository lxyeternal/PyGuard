      "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior with repeated external network contact during import and setup, indicative of potential malicious activity or data exfiltration. While no explicit payloads are present, the pattern aligns with common malicious tactics. The malware score should be set around 0.8, and the security risk score around 0.8, reflecting high concern. The code should be flagged for further investigation and caution before use."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign in structure but suspicious due to its external request to an unusual URL. The suspicion warrants further investigation into the domain and port, but no direct malicious activity is confirmed. Scores should be moderate, emphasizing caution rather than certainty."
