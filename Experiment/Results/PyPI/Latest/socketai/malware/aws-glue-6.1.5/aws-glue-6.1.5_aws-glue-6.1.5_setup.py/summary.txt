  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior with repeated external network contact during import and setup, indicative of potential malicious activity or data exfiltration. While no explicit payloads are present, the pattern aligns with common malicious tactics. The malware score should be set around 0.8, and the security risk score around 0.8, reflecting high concern. The code should be flagged for further investigation and caution before use."
