{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom post-installation hook that makes an HTTP request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long_description, and the 'requests' library is used to make an HTTP GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue'.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' call sends data to an external server, potentially leaking information or enabling command and control if the server is malicious. The 'setup' function and custom install class do not perform other data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code initiates a network request immediately at import time via 'requests.get', and again during the post-install process within 'PostInstallCommand.run'. The flow involves making outbound requests from the package during installation, which can be triggered without user consent.",
  "anomalies": "The URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue' appears suspicious, especially as it's used for a request during setup, which is uncommon for legitimate packages. The immediate request at import time and again during installation suggests malicious intent to contact a command-and-control server or exfiltrate information. No other malicious code or hardcoded credentials are present, but the network behavior is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'aws-glue'. It makes an HTTP GET request to an external server at 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue' twice: once immediately during import, and once during the custom post-installation process. This behavior indicates an attempt to contact an external server, potentially for malicious purposes such as establishing command-and-control communication, data exfiltration, or tracking. The setup uses a custom install command to ensure the request is made post-install, but the initial request during import is also suspicious. The rest of the code appears typical for a setup script, with no signs of obfuscated code or embedded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its network activity to a potentially malicious server during package setup and installation. The immediate request at import time and during post-install suggest malicious intent, possibly for command-and-control or data exfiltration. There are no other indicators of malicious behavior or obfuscation, but the network behavior warrants caution.",
