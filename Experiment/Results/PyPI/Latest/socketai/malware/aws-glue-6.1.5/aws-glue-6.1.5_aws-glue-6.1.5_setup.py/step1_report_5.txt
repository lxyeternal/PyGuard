{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup with a custom install command that performs an HTTP GET request upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from the URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue' during module import and in the post_install() method invoked after installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends data to an external server; this could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or malicious command and control communication.",
  "flows": "The external URL is requested immediately upon module import and again during the install process via the post_install() function, which is executed after the package is installed.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unsolicited GET request to a suspicious domain ('pov.sh') both at import and post-install, which is unusual for standard package setup scripts. The URL and repeated requests suggest potential tracking or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and the 'requests' library, then makes an HTTP GET request to an external, suspicious domain immediately during import, which is atypical for benign packages. A custom install command is defined that calls this request again during post-installation, enabling repeated contact with the external server. No other malicious code such as data theft, backdoors, or system modifications is present. The repeated external requests could be used for tracking, command-and-control, or exfiltration, which raises security concerns. The package metadata appears normal, but the behavior of making external requests on install is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by making external network requests to an untrusted domain both at import and during installation, which could be used for malicious tracking, data exfiltration, or command and control. This indicates a high risk of malicious intent and potential supply chain compromise.",
