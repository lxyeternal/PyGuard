{
  "purpose": "The code makes external HTTP GET requests to a suspicious URL during import and installation, indicating potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Global scope import statement `requests.get(...)` and the `post_install()` function called during package installation via a custom command.",
  "sinks": "External URL request `http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue` which could lead to data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.",
  "flows": "Code executes `requests.get()` at import; during `post_install()`; and during the custom install command, all leading to external network contact.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated external network requests during import and install without clear purpose; hardcoded suspicious URL; no obfuscation; no other malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs an immediate external network request at import time and again during package installation via a custom command. The URL is hardcoded and external, which is unusual for benign setup scripts. The repeated contact to this URL suggests potential for malicious activity such as data exfiltration or remote command control. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or embedded payloads. The network activity alone warrants suspicion. The malware score should be high due to the behavior, and the security risk score should reflect the potential for malicious exploitation. The scores are consistent with behavior indicating high suspicion of malicious intent, especially in supply chain contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly suspicious behavior with repeated external network contact during import and setup, indicative of potential malicious activity or data exfiltration. While no explicit payloads are present, the pattern aligns with common malicious tactics. The malware score should be set around 0.8, and the security risk score around 0.8, reflecting high concern. The code should be flagged for further investigation and caution before use.",
