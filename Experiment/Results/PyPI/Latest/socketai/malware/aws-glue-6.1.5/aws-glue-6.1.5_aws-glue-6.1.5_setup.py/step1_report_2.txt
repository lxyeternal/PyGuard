{
  "purpose": "The script defines a Python package setup configuration, including a custom installation command that performs an HTTP GET request to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata from the setup script, and makes an HTTP GET request to http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue during import and during the custom post-install step.",
  "sinks": "The GET request to an external server can be considered a sink, as it involves network communication with a potentially malicious or untrusted server.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the code execution at import time and during post-install via requests.get to the external URL. This external call is the source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes making an HTTP request to an external server at import time and during post-install, which is not typical for standard setup scripts. The URL is hardcoded and points to a specific IP address, which may be suspicious. No credentials or sensitive data are handled explicitly, but the act of connecting to an external server during installation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a custom installation command that makes an HTTP GET request to a specific external URL during both import and post-install phases. This network activity during package installation is unusual and can be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, tracking, or executing malicious payloads. The URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue' is hardcoded, and no safeguards or validation are present, indicating potential malicious intent or at least malicious behavior. The code does not perform any data validation or checks before making the request. No other suspicious code such as dynamic execution or backdoors is present. Overall, the main concern is the external network request triggered automatically during installation, which could be leveraged for malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by making an external HTTP request during installation, which could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or executing malicious commands. This behavior is suspicious and should be reviewed thoroughly before use. No other malicious code is detected, but the network activity alone is a significant security concern.",
