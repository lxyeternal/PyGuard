{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup with a custom post-installation step that performs an HTTP GET request to a specified URL after installation.",
  "sources": "The request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue' occurs in the global scope and within the post_install() function, which is executed during package installation.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP GET request can send system information or other data to the specified server, potentially leaking data or allowing remote control or monitoring.",
  "flows": "The code executes 'requests.get' at import time and again during installation via the post_install() function, which is called in the overridden run() method of the custom install command.",
  "anomalies": "The request to an external server occurs unconditionally at import time and during installation, which is unusual and suspicious. No clear purpose is provided for this network communication.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and performs an immediate HTTP GET request to a remote URL. It then defines a post-install function that repeats this request. A custom install command class is created to execute this request after package installation. The setup() function registers this custom command, ensuring the request runs during install. The repeated network request to an external server, especially without any explicit user consent or clear purpose, indicates potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or system monitoring. There are no other suspicious code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The network activity is embedded in the installation process, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior involving repeated external network requests during import and installation, which could be used for data exfiltration or remote monitoring. This pattern suggests malicious intent or at least covert system surveillance. The package should be scrutinized further before use.",
