{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script with a custom installation command that performs an HTTP GET request to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "The request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue' is executed immediately upon import and within the post-installation routine.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP GET request sends data to an external server, which could potentially leak information about the environment or be used for tracking.",
  "flows": "Upon import, the code makes a GET request to the external server. During package installation, the custom install command also executes this request again, creating multiple external contact points.",
  "anomalies": "The URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/aws-glue' is hardcoded and external, suggesting possible tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The request is made at import time and during installation, which is unusual behavior for a standard package. No other malicious code such as file access, system modification, or data theft is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and the 'requests' library. It immediately performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL upon execution, indicating contact with an external server. A custom install command is defined to perform the same request during package installation. This behavior could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or malicious monitoring. No other suspicious activities, such as code injection, backdoors, or data theft, are evident. The URL's presence and the repeated external contact point suggest potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. The code does not contain obfuscation or hidden malicious code beyond this external contact.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits suspicious behavior by contacting an external server both on import and during installation, which may be used for tracking or data exfiltration. No evidence of malicious code execution or backdoors is present, but the external contact itself is a security concern. Overall, this package should be treated with suspicion due to its external network activity during setup.",
