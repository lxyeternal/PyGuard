  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process that includes a custom install step which exfiltrates system information.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) are collected and sent via HTTP GET request to an external URL during installation",
  "anomalies": "The code exfiltrates system data without user consent, uses a hardcoded external URL for data transfer, and embeds malicious behavior within a standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports necessary modules and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. During installation, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is hidden within a typical setup process and activates during package installation, which could be exploited for spying or data theft. The URL used is suspicious and external, indicating potential malicious intent. The code does not perform any other benign setup operations beyond this data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior intended for data exfiltration during package installation, which is not typical or benign for a setup script. It leverages standard packaging tools to covertly send system information to an external server, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
