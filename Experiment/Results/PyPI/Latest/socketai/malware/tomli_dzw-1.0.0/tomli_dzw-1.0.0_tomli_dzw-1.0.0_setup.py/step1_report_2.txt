{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with a custom installation behavior that collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username from environment variables and system calls.",
  "sinks": "Requests to 'https://eo3go07kibmnkye.m.pipedream.net' with collected system information.",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, cwd, and username flows into the requests.get call, sending data externally during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects system data and exfiltrates it via a GET request without user consent. The URL used is suspicious and indicates potential data collection or tracking behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools installation process by adding a CustomInstall class that overrides the run method. It gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then transmits this data to an external server. Such behavior suggests potential malicious intent, such as user tracking or system reconnaissance, during package installation. The use of a third-party URL for data exfiltration is suspicious. No other malicious code or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior by secretly exfiltrating system information during package installation. It indicates an intent to track or spy on users without their knowledge, constituting supply chain malicious activity.",
