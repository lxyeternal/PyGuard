{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation by sending it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL, without user consent.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() during the run() method of the CustomInstall class",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call transmitting data to an external URL",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are collected in run() and sent directly via requests.get() to the external URL",
  "anomalies": "Covert data exfiltration during installation without user awareness, contact with suspicious external URL, no user prompts or consent mechanisms",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during setup, gathers environment info and transmits it to an external server. This behavior is hidden within the setup process, with no indication or consent. The URL used is suspicious, indicating potential tracking or data theft. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The exfiltration is malicious, violating user privacy, and could be exploited for malicious surveillance. The behavior aligns with malicious activity, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code does not contain obfuscation, so the obfuscated score is zero. The activity's covert nature and external contact justify a malware score of approximately 0.9 and a security risk score of around 0.85, with high confidence (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, representing malicious behavior with high security risk. The scores should reflect this, with malware and risk scores near 0.9, and obfuscation score at 0. The activity constitutes a privacy violation and potential malicious surveillance, warranting high concern.",
