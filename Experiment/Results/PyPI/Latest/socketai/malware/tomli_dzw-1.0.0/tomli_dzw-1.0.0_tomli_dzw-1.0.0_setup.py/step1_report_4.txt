  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (https://eo3go07kibmnkye.m.pipedream.net).",
  "flows": "From reading system info (hostname, cwd, username) to sending this data via requests.get() to the remote server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request during the install process, which is unusual and potentially malicious. No obvious comments or documentation explaining this behavior. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and possibly malicious. No user consent prompts or disclosures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup.py installation process by adding a custom command (CustomInstall) that, upon running, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. Immediately after, it performs a GET request to a remote server with this data as URL parameters. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate system information during package installation. Such behavior is suspicious and may be malicious, especially as it contacts an external server without user knowledge or consent. The URL used looks like a malicious or testing endpoint, and no safeguards or logging are implemented. No other malicious activities or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a potentially malicious data exfiltration during package installation by sending system info to an external server. This is a security concern, as it could compromise user privacy and indicates malicious intent. The code is not obfuscated but contains covert network activity typical of malicious packages.",
