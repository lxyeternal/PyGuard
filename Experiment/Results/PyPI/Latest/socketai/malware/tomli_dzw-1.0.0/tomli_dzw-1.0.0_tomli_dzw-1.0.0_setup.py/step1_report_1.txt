  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation process that reports system information to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation process.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected system information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (https://eo3go07kibmnkye.m.pipedream.net).",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() call to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code exfiltrates environment information without user consent, and the URL used appears suspicious and designed for data collection. No user input validation or opt-out mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the setup.py install command with a custom class that collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data to an external server using requests.get(). This behavior is hidden within the installation process, potentially to exfiltrate user environment data without explicit user awareness. The URL is suspicious and appears to be used for data collection or tracking. No other malicious code or backdoors are present. The primary concern is the covert exfiltration of environment info during package installation, which raises privacy and security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system data to an external server during installation, constituting a security risk. It can be used for tracking or malicious surveillance of users' systems. The code is intentionally designed to gather and transmit system info covertly.",
