{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process that includes a custom install command which collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, current working directory, and username via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Sends data to external URL https://eo3go07kibmnkye.m.pipedream.net using requests.get with parameters.",
  "flows": "Data collected from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get call, sending information to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code conducts data exfiltration during installation without user consent; no input validation or obfuscation; usage of hardcoded URL; no error handling for the network request.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon installation, gathers system information such as hostname, current directory, and username. It then immediately sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious as it exfiltrates user system details without disclosure or consent. The code does not perform any other suspicious activities or malicious actions like executing malicious commands or accessing sensitive files. However, the act of collecting and transmitting environment info during installation constitutes data leakage and privacy violation. The URL used is hardcoded and external, indicating potential tracking or spying activity. No obfuscation or anti-analysis techniques are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It is designed to spy on users by sending their hostname, current directory, and username to an external server without notice. While it does not directly harm the system, its privacy invasion and data exfiltration behavior are concerning.",
