{
  "purpose": "The script defines a Python package setup process with a custom post-installation step that executes a network request.",
  "sources": "The code reads platform node and system information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and performs HTTP GET requests using requests.get() to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL includes platform information and the external IP address fetched from 'https://api.ipify.org', and then makes a GET request to this URL, potentially transmitting sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input flows from platform.node(), platform.system(), and requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text into URL construction, which then flows into requests.get(url), transmitting data to an external webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send' function performs an unsolicited data exfiltration during installation without user consent. Use of a webhook URL suggests potential tracking or malicious data collection. Importing 'platform' as a package in install_requires is unnecessary and unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, then defines a 'send' function that gathers system hostname and OS information, retrieves external IP, constructs a URL embedding this data, and makes a GET request to a remote webhook URL. This function is invoked during the post-install process, meaning every installation transmits system info to an external server without user awareness. The inclusion of 'platform' in install_requires is redundant and potentially suspicious, as 'platform' is a standard library module. The overall behavior resembles malicious data exfiltration during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation via a remote webhook, which constitutes a security and privacy risk. The code is designed to silently transmit system data, indicating likely malicious intent.",
