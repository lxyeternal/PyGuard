{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including a custom post-installation step that executes a network request.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's hostname and OS via platform.node() and platform.system(), and fetches the public IP address using requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text.",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed in send() is called with requests.get(url), which sends data to an external webhook URL, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "The system info (hostname, OS, public IP) is combined into a URL string and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server when the package is installed.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function is invoked during the installation process, which is unusual for package setup scripts. It leaks system info to an external URL without user consent, indicating malicious or at least suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools and defines a custom install command that overrides the run() method. Within this method, it calls send(), which constructs a URL containing system information and sends it to an external webhook. This behavior could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The request to 'https://webhook.site' suggests the data is being exfiltrated intentionally. The inclusion of 'requests' and 'platform' modules is standard, but their use here for information gathering and transmission during install is suspicious. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present outside this network activity. Overall, this pattern resembles malicious data collection rather than benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a post-installation script that leaks system information to an external webhook, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. This behavior could compromise user privacy and indicates malicious intent. The code should be considered unsafe for use.",
