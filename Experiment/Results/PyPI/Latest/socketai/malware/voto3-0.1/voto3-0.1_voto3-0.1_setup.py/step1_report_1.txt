{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with a custom post-installation script that executes a network request.",
  "sources": "requests.get() calls to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and a webhook URL), platform.node(), platform.system() for system info",
  "sinks": "URL request constructed with system info and external IP, sent via requests.get() to a webhook endpoint",
  "flows": "platform.node() and platform.system() + requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') generate data, which are concatenated into a URL; this URL is then accessed via requests.get() to send data to a webhook",
  "anomalies": "The send() function sends system hostname, OS, and external IP to a remote webhook URL during installation, which is unusual behavior for typical package setup",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup process that includes a custom installation command. During installation, the send() function is invoked, which retrieves the system's hostname, OS name, and external IP address, then sends this data to a specified webhook URL. This behavior is atypical for standard package installations and suggests data exfiltration without user consent. The external request to collect and transmit system info indicates potential malicious intent or privacy violations. No other suspicious code or backdoors are evident beyond this data collection and transmission step.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs normal package setup but includes a hidden malicious behavior: sending system information to an external webhook during installation. This indicates a privacy violation and potential malicious activity. The overall security risk is high due to this behavior.",
