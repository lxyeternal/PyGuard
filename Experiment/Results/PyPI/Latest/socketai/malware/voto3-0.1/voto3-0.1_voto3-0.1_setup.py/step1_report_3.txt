{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, performs a post-installation action.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the platform module, the IP address via requests to 'https://api.ipify.org', and the system hostname via platform.node().",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with data is sent via a GET request to a webhook URL (https://webhook.site/...), which could be used to exfiltrate system information.",
  "flows": "Source: platform.node() and platform.system() + IP address via requests.get() -> URL construction -> requests.get() to send data to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an automatic, unprompted data exfiltration during installation. The URL is hardcoded to a specific webhook, which indicates potentially malicious or at least suspicious behavior. There is no user consent or notification for this action.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration using setuptools. However, it includes a custom post-install command that, after installation, collects system hostname and external IP address and then sends this information to an external URL via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is suspicious because it occurs automatically during package installation without user awareness or consent, suggesting potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking. The code does not contain obfuscation or attempts to hide its behavior, but its intent is malicious or at least privacy-intrusive.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs hidden data exfiltration during package installation by sending system information to an external webhook, indicating malicious behavior. It poses security risks if used maliciously, and users should avoid installing such packages.",
