{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process with a custom post-installation step that sends system information to a webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, OS information, and external IP address via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text",
  "sinks": "Constructed URL sends data via requests.get() to an external webhook, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "Post-install run: system info (hostname, OS, IP) → URL construction → GET request to external webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send' function executes a GET request to a webhook URL with system info embedded, which is suspicious as it leaks user/system data without consent. The code dynamically retrieves external IP and system name, then transmits this data to a remote server during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function that collects system hostname, OS type, and external IP address. This data is concatenated into a URL that points to a webhook, and a GET request is made to that URL. The 'PostInstallCommand' class overrides the 'run' method to invoke 'send' after installation completes. During setup, the custom command is registered for the 'install' process. The primary concern is that system and network information are sent to an external server without user knowledge or consent, which could be used for malicious tracking or reconnaissance. The usage of requests to exfiltrate data indicates malicious intent or at least privacy invasion, violating normal package behavior expectations.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a post-install script that exfiltrates system information to an external webhook URL, indicating malicious behavior and privacy violation. This behavior is highly suspicious and could be used for malicious surveillance or tracking purposes.",
