{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system hostname, OS, and external IP during installation by sending this data to a webhook URL, without user consent.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to external webhook URL",
  "flows": "source data (hostname, OS, IP) collected in send() -> URL constructed -> GET request sent to webhook",
  "anomalies": "Network requests during package installation, sending system info to external server, unnecessary inclusion of 'platform' in install_requires",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, calls send(), which collects system info and external IP, then transmits this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded webhook URL. This behavior is unusual and suspicious for a setup script, indicating potential malicious activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but performs covert data exfiltration during installation. The inclusion of 'platform' in install_requires is unnecessary, as it is part of the standard library. The behavior violates user privacy and could be used maliciously. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.8-0.9, security risk ~0.8-0.9, obfuscated 0) are justified given the malicious intent and privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious data exfiltration during package installation, which is a privacy violation and potentially malicious. The reports correctly identify this behavior, and their scores are appropriate. The overall assessment indicates high malware and security risk scores, warranting caution or avoidance of this package.",
