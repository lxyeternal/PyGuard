{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing and possibly interacts with external systems, but no clear malicious intent is identified.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements and network requests; possibly writes to files or databases.",
  "flows": "Input data is read, processed, and then sent over network or stored, but no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks that are clearly malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and defines functions that process data. It reads environment variables and input parameters, then performs data transformations. Network requests are made using the requests library, but these appear to be standard API calls or data uploads. No code injection, credential theft, or unauthorized system modifications are evident. The code structure is straightforward, and no hidden or misleading behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is typical for data processing tasks, with no suspicious signals detected.",
