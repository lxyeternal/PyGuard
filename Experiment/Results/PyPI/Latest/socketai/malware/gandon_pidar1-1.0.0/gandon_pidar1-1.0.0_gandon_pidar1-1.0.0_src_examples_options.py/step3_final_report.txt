{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies, providing a structured analysis and scoring.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, function arguments, files, network requests, user inputs, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, files, environment variables, subprocess calls, and print statements where untrusted data could lead to leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or external systems), with no suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code structures detected; dynamic behaviors are benign or typical.",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard, with no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The data flows are typical for data processing scripts, and no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are present. Confidence in benign nature is high (0.9), and the security risk is low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern. No malicious indicators or obfuscation detected, and the code's behavior aligns with typical benign scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The reports are consistent and appropriate, with scores accurately reflecting the benign analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
