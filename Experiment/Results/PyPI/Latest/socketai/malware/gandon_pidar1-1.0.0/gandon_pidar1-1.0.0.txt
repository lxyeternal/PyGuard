      "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, capable of executing arbitrary code during package installation or development. The use of base64 obfuscation and dynamic execution is characteristic of supply chain attacks. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' implies that malicious payloads are intended to be inserted, making this package highly suspicious and potentially dangerous. All evidence supports classifying this as malicious or at least highly suspicious, warranting caution and further investigation."
