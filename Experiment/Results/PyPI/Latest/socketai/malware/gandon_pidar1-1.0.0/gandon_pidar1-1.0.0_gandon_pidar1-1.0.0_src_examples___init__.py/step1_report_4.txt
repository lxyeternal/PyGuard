  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not read from external inputs or environment variables directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful actions, such as network connections or file modifications.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow is present; the code performs local processing without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code structure appears standard without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python functions and logic, without use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs. No network operations, system modifications, or credential handling are detected. The overall pattern suggests benign utility or processing functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be safe and free from malicious activity, with no indications of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious injections.",
