  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, data processing functions, potential network or file I/O points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file system access, environment variable reads, data output points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, file system, environment), with no suspicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious functions or behaviors, code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets show standard data processing and environment variable usage without network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious functions. Confidence is high that no malicious behavior exists. No anomalies or indicators of sabotage are present. The overall structure and signals suggest benign intent. Given the limited context, the risk is minimal, and no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate, and malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The assessments across reports are consistent and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
