{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to decode a base64-encoded string and execute it via os.system() during package installation or development, enabling arbitrary code execution at setup time.",
  "sources": "The base64 string ('CODE_REPLACE') decoded by b64d(), which is then used as input to os.system() in notmalfunc().",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executes the decoded code, which can lead to command execution, data leakage, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded by b64d(), then passed to os.system() within notmalfunc(), which is invoked during the run of custom install/develop classes, thus executing the payload during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate code, dynamic execution via os.system(), and the placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' indicating potential payload insertion; no input validation or sandboxing present.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern involves decoding a base64 string and executing it during package setup, which is a common technique in malicious supply chain attacks. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' suggests that malicious payloads could be inserted, enabling arbitrary command execution. The use of obfuscation and dynamic execution points to malicious intent. The pattern is consistent across reports, with high suspicion and high security risk scores. The code's structure allows for remote or local malicious payloads to run silently during installation, posing a severe security threat. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the pattern and typical attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior, capable of executing arbitrary code during package installation or development. The use of base64 obfuscation and dynamic execution is characteristic of supply chain attacks. The placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' implies that malicious payloads are intended to be inserted, making this package highly suspicious and potentially dangerous. All evidence supports classifying this as malicious or at least highly suspicious, warranting caution and further investigation.",
