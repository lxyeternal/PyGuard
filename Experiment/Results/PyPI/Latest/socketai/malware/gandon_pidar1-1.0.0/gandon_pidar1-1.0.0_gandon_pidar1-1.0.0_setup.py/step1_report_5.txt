{
  "purpose": "The script is intended to set up a Python package and execute potentially malicious code during installation or development setup.",
  "sources": "The function notmalfunc() calls os.system() with decoded base64 string, which is invoked during package installation via the AfterInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call is a sink that executes decoded code, which could be malicious if the base64 string decodes to harmful commands.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded by b64d(), then executed by os.system() in notmalfunc(), which is triggered during the install process in AfterInstall.run().",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with os.system() to execute dynamically decoded code is suspicious; the code within the base64 string is obfuscated and can hide malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines custom classes to hook into the package installation process. The notmalfunc() function decodes a base64 string and executes it via os.system(), which is inherently dangerous. During the package installation, the AfterInstall.run() method triggers notmalfunc(), executing the decoded code. The actual command in the base64 string is obfuscated, but its execution poses a high security risk. The code structure appears intentionally designed to hide malicious commands behind decoding and dynamic execution. The rest of the setup code appears normal but is used to facilitate the execution of potentially malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior through dynamic code execution during installation, likely used to run harmful commands covertly. The obfuscation and execution pattern strongly suggest malicious intent.",
