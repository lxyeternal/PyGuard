{
  "purpose": "This setup script is designed to configure and install a Python package, but it includes malicious behavior by executing potentially harmful code during installation or development.",
  "sources": "The function b64d() which decodes base64-encoded code; the call to os.system() within notmalfunc() that executes decoded code; the run() methods in AfterInstall and AfterDevelop classes that trigger notmalfunc() during install/develop phases.",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call in notmalfunc() that executes arbitrary code decoded from base64, which can lead to command execution, system compromise, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded string is decoded by b64d(), then passed to os.system() in notmalfunc(), which is called during installation or development via AfterInstall and AfterDevelop classes, executing the decoded code on the system.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a base64-encoded string 'CODE_REPLACE' indicates obfuscation; the code executes decoded data via os.system(), which is suspicious; the placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE' suggests that malicious code could be injected or replaced.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines functions for decoding base64-encoded code. The notmalfunc() function executes decoded code via os.system(), which is inherently risky. The custom install and develop commands invoke notmalfunc() during their run methods, meaning that malicious code could execute automatically during package installation or development setup. The presence of 'CODE_REPLACE' indicates the actual malicious payload is intended to be inserted here, potentially allowing arbitrary commands or malware execution. Overall, the code is designed to run arbitrary code decoded from base64 during package setup phases, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains malicious behavior by executing decoded code during installation or development, indicating potential malware distribution. The use of base64 encoding and execution via os.system() are classic obfuscation and malicious indicators. This package should not be used without further inspection and removal of the malicious payload.",
