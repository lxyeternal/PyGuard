  "sources": "b64d function decoding base64 string; notmalfunc() calling os.system with decoded code",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing decoded code, which could run arbitrary commands",
  "flows": "b64d decodes encoded string -> returns code -> notmalfunc() executes os.system with decoded code",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding to hide execution of code; executing dynamic code via os.system with decoded content",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function b64d that decodes a base64 string into code. The function notmalfunc calls os.system with this decoded code. The code within 'setuptools.setup' includes custom commands AfterDevelop and AfterInstall, where AfterInstall runs notmalfunc(). The base64 string passed to b64d is 'CODE_REPLACE', which appears to be a placeholder but suggests that in actual use, it might be replaced with malicious code. The use of base64 decoding combined with executing decoded content via os.system is suspicious, as it can be used to hide malicious commands or payloads. The setup script itself appears normal but contains this potentially malicious dynamic execution mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a mechanism to decode and execute arbitrary code via os.system, which is a significant security concern. Although the actual base64 string is a placeholder, the pattern indicates potential for malicious payloads if replaced with harmful code. The package could execute malicious commands during installation or development setup.",
