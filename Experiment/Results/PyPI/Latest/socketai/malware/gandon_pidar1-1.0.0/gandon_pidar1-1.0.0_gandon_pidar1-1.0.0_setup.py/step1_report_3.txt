  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that potentially executes hidden code during installation or development.",
  "sources": "The base64 encoded string in notmalfunc() function, which is decoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded base64 string with os.system, which can run arbitrary system commands.",
  "flows": "During package installation or development, notmalfunc() is invoked, decoding the base64 string and executing it as a system command.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding and dynamic code execution through os.system, with the actual code replaced by a placeholder ('CODE_REPLACE'), indicating obfuscated or malicious code intended to run at install time.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities and defines functions that decode base64-encoded strings to run system commands. Custom 'develop' and 'install' commands are subclassed to call notmalfunc() during execution. The presence of b64d() and its invocation in notmalfunc() suggests obfuscated code execution during installation or development, which is suspicious. The actual command is hidden behind base64, a common obfuscation tactic. The code's structure and comments imply malicious intent, especially given the package description referencing 'malicious pip packages'. The use of os.system to run decoded code poses a significant security risk, as it can execute arbitrary commands, potentially malicious ones.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears intentionally obfuscated and designed to execute arbitrary system commands during package install or development. The use of base64 decoding and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent, likely to run harmful code or backdoors on target systems.",
