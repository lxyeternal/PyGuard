  "purpose": "A standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and including sub-packages.",
  "sources": "No external input, dynamic code, or data sources; static metadata used in setup()",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The description mentioning 'pentesting' does not imply malicious intent within this script. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and low security risk scores. The confidence levels are high, and the scores are appropriate given the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The mention of 'pentesting' is not indicative of malicious intent in this context. Scores are consistent with the benign analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). No adjustments are necessary.",
