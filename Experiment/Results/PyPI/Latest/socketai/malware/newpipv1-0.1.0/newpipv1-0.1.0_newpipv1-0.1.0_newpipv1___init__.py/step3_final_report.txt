{
  "purpose": "The code executes a hardcoded network request to send data to an external URL, indicating malicious intent such as data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The `os.system()` call executing the curl command with fixed payload and URL.",
  "sinks": "The external URL receiving the POST request; network communication initiated by the system call.",
  "flows": "Code execution leads directly to the `os.system()` call, which runs the curl command, sending data to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `os.system()` with a hardcoded curl command; immediate execution upon script run; no input validation; suspicious external URL; no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines a function that runs a system command to POST 'Hacked!' to a suspicious URL, and immediately calls this function. This pattern indicates malicious activity, specifically data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and performs external network activity without user input or validation. The hardcoded URL and payload are typical indicators of malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9-1, security risk ~0.8-1, obfuscation 0) are consistent with this analysis. Given the clear malicious behavior, the malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should also be 1 to reflect the high severity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a malicious external POST request via a system call with hardcoded data and URL, indicating high malicious intent and security risk. The behavior is straightforward and suspicious, warranting maximum malware and security risk scores.",
