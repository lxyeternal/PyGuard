  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Behavior and Content:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple print statement: `print(\"hello\")`.\n   - There are no inputs, data flows, or external dependencies involved.\n   - No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or complex logic are present.\n   - The code is static and benign.\n\n2. **Assessment of Issues:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n   - No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security concerns are detected.\n   - The analysis in each report aligns with the actual code behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` score: 0\n     - `obfuscated` score: 0\n     - `securityRisk` score: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (indicating high certainty)\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Claims:**\n   - There are no claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions.\n   - The reports appropriately dismiss any suspicion.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency and Justification:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity, all scores are reasonable.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code poses no security risk, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
