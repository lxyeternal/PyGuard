  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'hello' to the console.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or environment variables; static print statement.",
  "sinks": "Console output; no untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement with a static string. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or system modifications. The scores assigned in all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and behavior. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code and the consensus across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
