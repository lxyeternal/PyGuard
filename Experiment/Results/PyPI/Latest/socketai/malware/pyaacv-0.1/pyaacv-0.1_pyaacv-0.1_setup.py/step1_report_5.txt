  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "Download URL in Invoke-WebRequest command; the file path where the executable is saved.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via Start-Process in PowerShell.",
  "flows": "Download the file from the URL -> Save to local system -> Execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external source and then runs it without validation, which is unusual and suspicious for a package installer.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation process to download an executable from a remote URL ('https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe') using PowerShell. If the download is successful, it immediately runs the executable using Start-Process, potentially executing malicious code without any validation or user consent. The approach indicates intentional execution of external code during installation, which poses significant security risks. No validation, checksums, or user prompts are present, increasing the likelihood of malicious intent. The use of subprocess.run with shell=True further amplifies the risk of command injection vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code actively downloads and executes a remote executable during package installation without validation, representing high malicious potential. This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests malicious intent or a supply chain attack.",
