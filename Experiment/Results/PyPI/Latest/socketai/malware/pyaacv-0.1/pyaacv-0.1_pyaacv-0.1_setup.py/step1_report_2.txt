{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes a file from a specified URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' to download an executable file using PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded file with Start-Process, which can run arbitrary code contained in the executable.",
  "flows": "The source (download URL) leads to saving the file locally, which then flows into execution via Start-Process, executing the downloaded content.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an external executable during installation and directly executes it without validation or user consent, which is highly suspicious. Use of PowerShell commands for download and execution is also unusual for typical package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard setup installation process to perform a download of an executable file from an external URL. It uses PowerShell commands via subprocess to download and then execute the file. This behavior is atypical for normal package installations and indicates possible malicious intent, such as installing malware or backdoors. No validation, checksums, or user prompts are present before executing the downloaded file. The download source is a GitHub URL, but the file's purpose and safety are unknown. This pattern strongly suggests malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized, automatic downloading and execution of an external executable during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent, such as deploying malware or backdoors. It poses a significant security risk if used in production or on user systems.",
