{
  "purpose": "The code customizes the installation process to download and execute a file from a remote URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe' via Invoke-WebRequest, and the downloaded file path 'CBLines.exe'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file using Start-Process, which may run malicious code without user awareness.",
  "flows": "Download via Invoke-WebRequest -> Save to local path -> Open and execute with Start-Process.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external source and immediately executes it without validation, which is highly suspicious. It also uses PowerShell commands with hardcoded URL and file paths, and runs potentially malicious code during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation command to include downloading an executable from a remote URL. It uses PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest to download 'CBLines.exe' to the current directory, then attempts to open and execute it via Start-Process. This behavior indicates the potential for executing arbitrary or malicious code during installation. The direct execution of an external file without validation or user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code does not verify the downloaded content, does not use secure methods for verification, and runs external code during package installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without validation or user approval. It is highly indicative of malware, such as a backdoor or malicious payload, and poses significant security risks. The package should not be used or trusted.",
