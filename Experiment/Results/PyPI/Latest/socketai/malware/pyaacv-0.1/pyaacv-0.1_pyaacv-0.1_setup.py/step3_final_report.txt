{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable from a remote URL during installation and executes it without validation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the hardcoded URL in the PowerShell command and the current working directory for saving the file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via PowerShell's Start-Process, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Source: URL in Invoke-WebRequest -> Sink: Start-Process executing the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of external code during setup without validation or user consent; use of shell=True with subprocess.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard installation process to download an executable from a hardcoded URL using PowerShell, then executes it without validation. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but performs high-risk actions. The download and execution happen automatically during setup, with no integrity checks or user prompts, representing a severe security risk. The behavior aligns with malicious activity, justified by high malware and security risk scores. The use of subprocess with shell=True, while controlled here, can be dangerous if inputs are manipulated. Overall, the code demonstrates malicious intent with high certainty.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without validation, representing a severe security threat. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and the behavior warrants classification as malicious activity.",
