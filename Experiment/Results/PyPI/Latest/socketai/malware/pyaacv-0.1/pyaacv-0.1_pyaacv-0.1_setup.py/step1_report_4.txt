{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes a remote executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the internet using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest to download a file from a specified URL.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded file using Start-Process, potentially running malicious code without user consent.",
  "flows": "Download file from URL -> Save locally -> Execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without user knowledge or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard setup install command to run additional steps. It downloads an executable from a hardcoded URL using PowerShell, then attempts to open/run it. This behavior is suspicious because it executes external code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware. The process involves remote code retrieval and execution, which are typical malicious indicators. The code also lacks any verification of the downloaded file's integrity or origin. Overall, the code presents a high risk of malicious activity due to automatic execution of remote content during installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote executable during package installation, representing a significant security risk. It bypasses standard procedures, potentially delivering malware to systems where the package is installed.",
