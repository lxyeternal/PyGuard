{
  "purpose": "Automatically collect system information and send it to a webhook upon import.",
  "sources": "The functions 'collect_system_info()' and 'send_data_to_webhook()' are called immediately when the module is imported.",
  "sinks": "The 'send_data_to_webhook()' function likely sends data over the network to an external endpoint.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() generates system data -> send_data_to_webhook() transmits this data externally upon import.",
  "anomalies": "Code executes network activity automatically upon import without any explicit user action or control; hardcoded or external webhook URL not visible, which may be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module: 'send_data_to_webhook' and 'collect_system_info'. Immediately upon import, it calls 'collect_system_info()', presumably gathering system details, and then sends this data using 'send_data_to_webhook()'. This behavior causes the package to transmit potentially sensitive system information to an external server automatically, which could be malicious or maliciously used for tracking or data exfiltration. The lack of control over when this network activity occurs and the absence of visible safeguards or conditions raises concerns. Without additional context about the implementations of these functions, the main suspicious aspect is the automatic data transmission at import time, which is a common pattern in malicious or privacy-invasive malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code automatically transmits system information to an external webhook upon import, which could be used maliciously for data collection or exfiltration. This behavior is suspicious, especially if the webhook URL is hidden or hardcoded elsewhere. The code exhibits a high potential for malicious intent due to its automatic, uncontrolled network activity.",
