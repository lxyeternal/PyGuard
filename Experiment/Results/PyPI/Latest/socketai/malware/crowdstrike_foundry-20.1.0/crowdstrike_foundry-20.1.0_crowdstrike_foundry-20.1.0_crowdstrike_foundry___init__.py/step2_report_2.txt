  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, comparing them to the original code and evaluating their reasoning, scores, and implications.\n\n**Summary of the original code:**\n- Imports `send_data_to_webhook` and `collect_system_info` from a local module.\n- Immediately upon import, calls `collect_system_info()` and passes its result to `send_data_to_webhook()`.\n- No user interaction, validation, error handling, or obfuscation.\n- Behavior is automatic and network activity occurs during import.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Observations:\n\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code executes data collection and transmission immediately upon import, which is suspicious behavior.\n- **Malicious intent:** While the code itself is simple, the pattern of automatic exfiltration without user consent is a strong indicator of potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior.\n- **Implementation details:** The actual functions' implementations are not provided, so we cannot definitively determine if they perform malicious actions or just benign data collection.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Score:** Malware 0.2, Security Risk 0.75\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes privacy concerns and potential maliciousness but assigns a relatively low malware score.\n- **Justification:** Given the behavior, a malware score of 0.2 seems understated. If the functions are capable of exfiltrating sensitive data, the malware risk should be higher, especially since the code exfiltrates data automatically without consent.\n- **Recommendation:** Increase malware score to at least 0.6 or higher, reflecting the privacy-invasive pattern.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Score:** Malware 0.75, Security Risk 0.75\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately notes the suspicious automatic data exfiltration, considering the pattern potentially malicious.\n- **Justification:** The high malware score aligns with the behavior described, assuming the functions are capable of transmitting sensitive info. No false assumptions detected.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep the scores as is.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Score:** Malware 0.75, Security Risk 0.8\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 2, recognizes the privacy concern and potential maliciousness.\n- **Justification:** The slightly higher security risk score is reasonable, given the automatic transmission.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Score:** Malware 0.75, Security Risk 0.75\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the suspicious behavior and potential for malicious use.\n- **Justification:** The malware score reflects the risk of data exfiltration, assuming functions are capable of transmitting sensitive data.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Score:** Malware 0.75, Security Risk 0.75\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous assessments, correctly identifies the suspicious pattern.\n- **Justification:** The behavior pattern warrants a malware score of at least 0.75, assuming malicious intent or capability.\n- **Recommendation:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### General conclusions:\n\n- The **main concern** is the automatic, unprompted data exfiltration during import, which is a hallmark of malicious or privacy-invasive code.\n- The **malware score** should be **higher** than 0.2 in Report 1, aligning with the behavior and potential for malicious activity.\n- The **security risk** scores are generally appropriate, given the behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** Should generally be **≥ 0.75** if the functions can transmit sensitive data without validation or user consent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly note no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Should be consistent with the behavior, leaning towards higher values given the privacy concerns.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.8** (due to automatic exfiltration, which is highly suspicious)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no signs of obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** **0.85** (automatic data exfiltration without consent is a serious security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe core issue is the behavior — automatic, unconsented data exfiltration upon import. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious or privacy-invasive software. The scores should reflect this higher risk, especially the malware score.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to update the scores or provide further detailed analysis.",
