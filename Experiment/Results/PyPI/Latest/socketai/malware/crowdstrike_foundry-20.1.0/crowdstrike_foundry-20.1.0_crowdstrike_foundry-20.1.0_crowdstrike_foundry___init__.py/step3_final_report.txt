{
  "purpose": "The code automatically collects system information and sends it over the network via a webhook during module import, indicating potential privacy invasion or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, invocation of collect_system_info() and send_data_to_webhook() during module load",
  "sinks": "send_data_to_webhook() function, which transmits data over the network; collect_system_info() as the data source",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() generates data source; data flows into send_data_to_webhook() which transmits it over the network upon import",
  "anomalies": "Immediate execution of data collection and transmission during module import without user control or validation; no obfuscation; potential privacy risk",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions and executes a call to collect system info and send it via webhook immediately upon import, which is suspicious behavior. Without implementation details, it is assumed that collect_system_info() gathers system data and send_data_to_webhook() transmits it over the network. The pattern indicates potential privacy invasion or malicious exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded credentials. The behavior warrants high suspicion, with a malware score around 0.75 due to automatic, unprompted data transmission, and a security risk score around 0.75-0.8 due to privacy concerns. The scores are consistent with the behavior, and further investigation into the functions' implementations is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic, untrusted data exfiltration during module import, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The behavior justifies high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. Scores should reflect high suspicion of privacy-invasive activity, with malware score around 0.75 and risk score around 0.75-0.8.",
