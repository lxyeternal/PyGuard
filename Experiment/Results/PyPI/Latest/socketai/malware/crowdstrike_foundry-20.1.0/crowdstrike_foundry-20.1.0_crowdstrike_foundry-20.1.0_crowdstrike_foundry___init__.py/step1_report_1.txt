  "purpose": "Automatically send system information to a webhook when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via collect_system_info() during import.",
  "sinks": "send_data_to_webhook() potentially transmits data over the network.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() -> send_data_to_webhook() during module import.",
  "anomalies": "Code triggers network activity immediately upon import without user consent, no validation of data, no security checks, and no indication of user permission. No error handling or obfuscation is present. Potential privacy concern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module: send_data_to_webhook and collect_system_info. Immediately upon import, it calls collect_system_info() to gather system data, then passes this data to send_data_to_webhook(), which likely transmits it over the network. The immediate data transmission without user interaction or validation raises privacy and security concerns. There are no obfuscation signs, no hardcoded credentials visible, and no indication of malicious intent beyond data exfiltration. The code’s simplicity suggests straightforward functionality, but the network activity triggered on import could be used maliciously to leak system information without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "This code automatically exfiltrates system information upon module import, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It may violate user privacy and security best practices. No explicit malicious behavior such as backdoors or code injection is evident, but the behavior is privacy-invasive and could be misused for malicious purposes.",
