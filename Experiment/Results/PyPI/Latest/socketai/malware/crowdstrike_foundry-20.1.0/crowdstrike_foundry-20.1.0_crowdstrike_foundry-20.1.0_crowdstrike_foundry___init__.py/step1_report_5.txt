{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information and immediately send it to a specified webhook upon import.",
  "sources": "The functions 'collect_system_info()' and 'send_data_to_webhook()' are invoked during module import.",
  "sinks": "The 'send_data_to_webhook()' function likely transmits data over the network to an external endpoint.",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() collects data → send_data_to_webhook() transmits data to an external server upon import.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate data transmission during import could indicate an attempt to collect and exfiltrate system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module and calls them immediately. This triggers data collection and transmission as soon as the package is imported, which could be used for malicious data exfiltration or privacy invasion. The code does not show any checks, user prompts, or safeguards, and the act of sending data during import is suspicious behavior often associated with malicious activity. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present in the code structure itself, but the behavior raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs system info collection and sends it to an external webhook immediately upon import, which can be used maliciously for data exfiltration without user knowledge. It warrants caution due to its potentially invasive behavior.",
