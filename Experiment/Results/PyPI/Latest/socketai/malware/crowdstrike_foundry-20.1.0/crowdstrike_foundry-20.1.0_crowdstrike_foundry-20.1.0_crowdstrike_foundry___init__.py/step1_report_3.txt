  "purpose": "Automatically collects system information and sends it to a webhook upon module import",
  "sources": "collect_system_info() function call during module import",
  "sinks": "send_data_to_webhook() function that transmits data externally",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() generates data -> send_data_to_webhook() transmits data to remote server",
  "anomalies": "Immediate data transmission upon import without any user control or validation, potential privacy concern",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module: one to collect system information and one to send data via a webhook. As soon as the module is imported, it executes send_data_to_webhook(collect_system_info()), which gathers system info and transmits it externally. This behavior could be used for malicious purposes, such as unauthorized data exfiltration, especially if the functions are designed to collect sensitive information. No validation, user consent, or conditional logic is present. The code executes automatically without explicit triggers or safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The code automatically exfiltrates system information upon import without user consent, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. This is suspicious and should be reviewed further for intent and data handling practices.",
