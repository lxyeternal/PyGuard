{
  "purpose": "Automatically collects system information and sends it to a webhook upon package import.",
  "sources": "The functions 'collect_system_info()' and 'send_data_to_webhook()' are called immediately when the module is imported.",
  "sinks": "The 'send_data_to_webhook()' function likely sends data over the network to an external webhook URL, which could be untrusted.",
  "flows": "Data collected from 'collect_system_info()' flows directly into 'send_data_to_webhook()', potentially transmitting system info externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes functions immediately on import without any control or user consent, which is unusual behavior. The functions are imported from a local module, but their implementation is not provided, making it difficult to assess security, though the pattern suggests potential privacy concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two functions from a local module and executes them immediately upon import, sending system info to an external webhook. This behavior can be used maliciously to exfiltrate data without user knowledge or consent. The lack of explicit configuration or conditional checks increases suspicion. The code is minimal but demonstrates a pattern consistent with stealth data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an automatic, unconditional data exfiltration upon import, which could be malicious or privacy-invasive depending on the context. The pattern is suspicious, especially if the functions perform sensitive data collection and transmission without user awareness.",
