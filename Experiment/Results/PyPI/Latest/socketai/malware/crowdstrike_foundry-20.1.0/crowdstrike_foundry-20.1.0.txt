      "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized, covert data exfiltration during package installation, representing a serious privacy and security concern. While it lacks malicious payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores should reflect high risk and malware suspicion, with a malware score around 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85. The package should be flagged for review or removal if found in the wild."

The behavior justifies high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation. Scores should reflect high suspicion of privacy-invasive activity, with malware score around 0.75 and risk score around 0.75-0.8."
