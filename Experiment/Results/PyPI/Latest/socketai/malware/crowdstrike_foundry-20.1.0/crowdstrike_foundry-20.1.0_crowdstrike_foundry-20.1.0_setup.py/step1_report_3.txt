{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as IP address, hostname, OS details, and the current file path. It also reads package metadata like long description from a file.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() function sends data to an external URL, which could leak system information to an external server.",
  "flows": "System info is collected in collect_system_info(), then sent via send_data_to_webhook() during the post-installation process triggered by the custom PostInstallCommand class.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed system information and transmits it to a remote server without user consent or notification. The webhook URL appears arbitrary and potentially malicious. The script runs during package installation, which can be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup and packaging functions but adds a custom post-install step that collects sensitive system info (IP address, hostname, OS details) and sends it to a remote webhook URL. This behavior is unusual and suspicious because it exfiltrates data during package installation without explicit user approval. The use of the requests library to send data to an external server raises privacy and security concerns. The presence of hardcoded URL and data collection without user notification indicates potentially malicious intent or privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "This code includes a malicious pattern of data exfiltration during package installation, collecting sensitive system data and sending it to an external server without user consent. It poses a significant privacy and security risk. The overall malicious intent score is high due to data exfiltration behavior. The package should be considered dangerous and avoided.",
