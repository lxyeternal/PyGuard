{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package that includes a custom post-installation process to collect system information and send it to an external webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads include socket.gethostbyname, socket.gethostname, platform.system, platform.version, platform.release, and os.path.abspath to gather system info; also reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function is used to send collected system info data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info is collected via system calls, then passed to send_data_to_webhook which transmits the data over the network to the specified webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration by collecting and transmitting system info without user consent, which is unusual for a setup script. The webhook URL is hardcoded and points to an external domain, which may be used maliciously. The script executes during installation, potentially without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install command that, after installation, gathers system details such as IP address, hostname, OS info, and script location. It then sends this data to a remote webhook URL. While this may be intended for legitimate monitoring, it can also be used maliciously for unauthorized data collection. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious language features. No credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident beyond the data exfiltration behavior. The webhook URL is external and hardcoded, raising privacy concerns. The code runs during package installation, which could be considered malicious if done without user consent or disclosure.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs system information collection and sends data to an external webhook during package installation, which can be used for malicious data exfiltration. While it may be intended for legitimate purposes, its behavior is potentially malicious if done without user knowledge. The overall security risk is moderate due to data transmission without user awareness, and malware likelihood is low but possible if repurposed for malicious activities.",
