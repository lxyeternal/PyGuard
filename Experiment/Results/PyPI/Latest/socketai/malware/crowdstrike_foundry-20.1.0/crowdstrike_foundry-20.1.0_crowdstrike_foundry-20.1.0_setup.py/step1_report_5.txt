{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package that, upon installation, collects system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from socket and platform modules (system info), and network requests are made using the requests library to send data to the webhook.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post function acts as a sink, transmitting collected system data to an external URL (the webhook).",
  "flows": "System info gathered via collect_system_info() flows into send_data_to_webhook(), which transmits it over the network, triggered during the post-installation process in the custom install command.",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally collects and sends detailed system information to an external URL during installation without user consent or clear necessity. The webhook URL is hardcoded and external, and the data collection occurs automatically as part of the package install process.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package. It includes a custom installation command that, after installing the package, gathers system details (IP address, hostname, OS info, install path) and sends this data to a remote webhook URL. The data collection uses standard modules (socket, platform, os) and a common library (requests). There are no obfuscated elements or suspicious code patterns, but the behavior of collecting and transmitting system data during installation without explicit user approval raises privacy concerns. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and the transmission occurs automatically post-installation, which could be exploited for malicious data exfiltration if the package is used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup and post-installation procedures but includes behavior that can be considered malicious or privacy-invasive—collecting and transmitting detailed system information to an external server automatically. While technically not malicious code per se, this behavior could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as unauthorized system monitoring or data exfiltration.",
