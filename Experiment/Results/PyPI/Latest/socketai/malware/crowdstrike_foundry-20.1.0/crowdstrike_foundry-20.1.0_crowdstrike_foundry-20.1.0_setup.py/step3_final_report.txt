{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script that, during installation, collects system information (IP address, hostname, OS details, script location) and sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL.",
  "sources": "The system info collection functions (collect_system_info) that read IP address, hostname, OS details, and script path; the setup process triggers the data transmission during installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() call that transmits the collected data to the external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the collection functions to the requests.post() call during the execution of the custom install command, which runs after the package is installed.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs automatic, silent data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, using a hardcoded external URL; no obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system information and transmits it to an external server during installation, which is suspicious and privacy-invasive. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The data exfiltration occurs silently, indicating potential misuse. The behavior resembles malicious activity, especially if used without user knowledge or consent. The hardcoded webhook URL and network activity during install are concerning. The code itself is benign in structure but malicious in intent due to privacy violations. The malware score should be high, around 0.8, reflecting the suspicious nature and potential for malicious use. The obfuscation score remains 0, as the code is clear. The security risk score should also be high, around 0.85, due to privacy invasion and potential exploitation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized, covert data exfiltration during package installation, representing a serious privacy and security concern. While it lacks malicious payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores should reflect high risk and malware suspicion, with a malware score around 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85. The package should be flagged for review or removal if found in the wild.",
