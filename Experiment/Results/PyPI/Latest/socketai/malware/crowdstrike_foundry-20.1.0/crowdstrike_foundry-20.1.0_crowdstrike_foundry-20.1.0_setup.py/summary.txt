  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized, covert data exfiltration during package installation, representing a serious privacy and security concern. While it lacks malicious payloads or obfuscation, its behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores should reflect high risk and malware suspicion, with a malware score around 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85. The package should be flagged for review or removal if found in the wild."
