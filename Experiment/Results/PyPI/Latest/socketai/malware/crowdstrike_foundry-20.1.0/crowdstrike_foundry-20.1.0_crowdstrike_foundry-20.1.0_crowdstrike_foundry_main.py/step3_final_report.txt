  "purpose": "The code collects system information (IP address, hostname, OS details, script path) and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded webhook URL, potentially for data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()), socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), platform.version(), platform.release(), __file__",
  "sinks": "requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, json=data)",
  "flows": "collect_system_info() -> send_data_to_webhook()",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL, no user consent or validation, straightforward data exfiltration pattern",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info and transmits it to an external server without obfuscation or malicious payloads. It does not perform any code injection, data leakage beyond exfiltration, or malicious actions. The behavior indicates potential privacy invasion but lacks active malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex logic. The data transmission to a hardcoded URL is suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a system info collector with potential privacy implications. It does not contain malware or obfuscation but could be misused for unauthorized data exfiltration. The behavior warrants caution but is not malicious in itself.",
