{
  "purpose": "The code collects basic system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()), socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), platform.version(), platform.release(), __file__",
  "sinks": "requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, json=data)",
  "flows": "System information is gathered from sources and then sent via HTTP POST to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded to an external site; code collects potentially sensitive system info and immediately transmits it without user consent or validation. No authentication or encryption is implemented for the data transfer, which could facilitate data interception. No validation or sanitization of the data is performed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os, platform, socket, and requests modules. It defines a webhook URL which is used for data exfiltration. The 'collect_system_info' function gathers IP address, hostname, OS details, and the script's path. The 'send_data_to_webhook' function posts this information to the webhook URL. The code does not include any user prompts or conditions; it automatically collects and transmits data upon execution. The hardcoded webhook URL and the immediate data transmission suggest potential malicious intent for data theft or unauthorized surveillance. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. The overall behavior appears to be collecting system info for possible exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, acting as a privacy violation. It gathers system information and sends it to an external webhook without user consent, indicating malicious or suspicious intent.",
