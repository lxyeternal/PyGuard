  "purpose": "Collects basic system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostbyname, socket.gethostname, platform.system, platform.version, platform.release, os.path.abspath(__file__)",
  "sinks": "requests.post to the webhook URL",
  "flows": "System info gathered via socket and platform functions flow into the data dictionary, which is then sent via HTTP POST request to the webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded webhook URL potentially for data exfiltration; collecting and transmitting system details without user consent; no validation or obfuscation of the webhook URL or data.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info such as IP address, hostname, OS details, and script path. It then sends this information to a hardcoded URL using an HTTP POST request. No user input or environment variables are involved. The code does not perform malicious actions like data theft, system damage, or network reconnaissance beyond data collection. The use of a webhook URL for potentially unauthorized data transmission is suspicious, but it appears to be intended for monitoring or testing purposes. There are no obfuscation techniques or malware signatures present. The data flow is straightforward and without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect and send system information to a specified URL. While it does transmit data externally, it lacks malicious payloads or behavior. Its suspicious aspect is the hardcoded webhook URL, which could be used maliciously if deployed in unauthorized contexts. Overall, it appears more like a system info collector than malware, but caution is advised if used without user consent.",
