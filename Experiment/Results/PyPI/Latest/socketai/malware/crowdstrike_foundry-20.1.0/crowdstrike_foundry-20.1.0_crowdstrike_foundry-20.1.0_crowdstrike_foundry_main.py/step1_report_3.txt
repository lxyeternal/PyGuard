  "sinks": "requests.post to WEBHOOK_URL with system info data",
  "flows": "Sources (system info collection) are sent directly to the webhook endpoint via requests.post",
  "anomalies": "The code collects potentially sensitive system details and immediately transmits them to an external URL without user consent or verification. The webhook URL is hardcoded and points to an external server, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries to gather system information such as IP address, hostname, OS details, and file path. It then constructs a data dictionary with these details and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a specified webhook URL. There are no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. However, the immediate transmission of system data to an external URL without user permission, along with the use of a public webhook, raises concerns. The script could be used maliciously to exfiltrate system details. No malicious code or backdoors are present, but the behavior of data exfiltration is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and transmits it to an external webhook without user consent, which is suspicious and could be malicious. While it does not contain explicit malware or obfuscation, its data exfiltration behavior warrants caution.",
