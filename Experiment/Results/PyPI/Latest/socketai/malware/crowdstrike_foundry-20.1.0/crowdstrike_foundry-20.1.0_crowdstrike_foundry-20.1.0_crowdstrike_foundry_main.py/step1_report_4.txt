  "purpose": "The code collects basic system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()), socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), platform.version(), platform.release(), os.path.abspath(__file__)",
  "sinks": "requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, json=data)",
  "flows": "System info is collected via socket and platform modules, then sent over HTTP POST request to the webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded webhook URL; the code captures and transmits potentially sensitive system information without user consent or transparency",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system details such as IP address, hostname, OS info, and the script's path, then sends this data to an external webhook. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and there is no user consent or security control. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or direct malicious actions are evident. The behavior appears to be data exfiltration of system info, which could be misused if intended maliciously, but based solely on this code, it is straightforward data collection.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily performs system information collection and transmission to an external webhook. While the implementation itself is simple and does not contain overt malicious code, the use of hardcoded webhook and data exfiltration pattern suggests potentially suspicious intent if used maliciously. It warrants caution due to privacy and security implications.",
