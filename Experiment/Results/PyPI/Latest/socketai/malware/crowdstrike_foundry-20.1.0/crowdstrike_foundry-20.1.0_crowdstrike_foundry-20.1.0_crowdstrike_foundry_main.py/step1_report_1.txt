  "purpose": "The code collects system information and sends it to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname()), socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), platform.version(), platform.release(), os.path.abspath(__file__)",
  "sinks": "requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, json=data)",
  "flows": "System information is gathered from system APIs and passed directly to an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded webhook URL pointing to an external server; no user input validation or authorization checks; potential to leak sensitive system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script collects detailed system information, including IP address, hostname, OS details, and file path. It then transmits this data to a remote server via an HTTP POST request. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL indicates the data is sent to a third-party endpoint, which could be malicious if used without user consent. The code does not perform any checks or obfuscation, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware payloads. While the actions are straightforward, sending system details to an external endpoint without user awareness could be considered malicious behavior in some contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily gathers and transmits system information to a remote webhook. While it does not contain explicit malicious code such as backdoors or data theft, the behavior of sending system info to an external server without user permission or notification raises security and privacy concerns. It could be part of a malicious supply chain component if used improperly. Overall, the code is suspicious due to its data exfiltration activity, but does not exhibit clear malware behavior.",
