  "purpose": "Build, test, release, and documentation automation for a Python project, with some insecure practices such as hardcoded secrets and environment manipulations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION', 'env.password'), imported modules, function arguments, sys.path modifications, hardcoded strings (e.g., 'sikrit', 'some-gateway', 'mypass').",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls (c.run), environment variable assignments, dynamic imports, network configurations, sys.path modifications.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and hardcoded secrets flow into subprocess commands, environment setup, and module imports; sys.path modifications influence module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded plaintext passwords ('sikrit', 'mypass'), environment variables with secrets, sys.path removal of current directory, dynamic import statements, plaintext credentials in code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily automates build, test, and deployment tasks using Invoke. It contains insecure practices such as hardcoded secrets and environment variable reliance, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised. No active malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or obfuscated code are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets and environment configurations, which could lead to leaks or misuse but do not constitute malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate automation tool with insecure practices rather than malicious code. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The security risk is moderate due to insecure secrets and environment handling, but overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
