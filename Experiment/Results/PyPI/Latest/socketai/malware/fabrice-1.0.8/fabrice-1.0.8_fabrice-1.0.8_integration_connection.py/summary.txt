  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled test suite for SSH and command execution functionalities. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks. The only minor security concern is the use of a hardcoded sudo password in a testing context, which is acceptable here. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to environment-dependent assumptions and test setup. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
