  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign testing utility for SSH connection independence and threading verification. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current low malware and obfuscated scores, along with a minimal risk score (~0.1-0.2), are justified and appropriate given the code's purpose and behavior."
