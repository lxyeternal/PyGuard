{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or user inputs; exception classes are defined statically.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiations could be triggered by errors, but do not cause data leaks or security issues directly.",
  "flows": "Exceptions could be raised in response to errors but do not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The comments suggest potential code restructuring but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, each serving as specific error indicators. No external data is read, nor are there unsafe data handling practices. The code is straightforward and lacks complex logic, dynamic execution, or obfuscated patterns. It appears to be standard, clean exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings and minimal logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be safe, standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security issues. It is unlikely to be malicious or maliciously crafted.",
