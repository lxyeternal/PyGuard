  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions (`NothingToDo`, `GroupException`, `InvalidV1Env`).\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - No data processing, external input handling, or dangerous operations are present.\n   - The code appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase, serving as error indicators.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, with no security concerns.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is safe and free of malicious intent is justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are at maximum (1), which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this with zero scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to zero across all reports.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No further security concerns or malicious activity are evident.\n- The reports' conclusions are justified and accurate.\n\n**In summary, the code is safe, and the scoring reflects that accurately.**",
