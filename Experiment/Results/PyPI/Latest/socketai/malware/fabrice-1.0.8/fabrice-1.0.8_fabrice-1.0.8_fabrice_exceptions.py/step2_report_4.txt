  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scoring, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code in question is a set of simple custom exception class definitions.\n- No data processing, input handling, dynamic code, or external data sources are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with descriptive docstrings, and serves as part of a larger application.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- The code matches the description in the reports: it only defines exception classes.\n- No logic, data flow, or external input is involved.\n- The classes are standard and do not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The reasoning that the code is purely structural and safe is sound.\n- The explanations are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' reasoning is correct; no flaws are identified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty.\n- These scores are reasonable given the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n- No reason to increase the risk scores.\n\n**Conclusion:** The risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Malware Score Analysis**\n\n- All reports assign malware score as 0.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n#### **Challenging Assumptions about Vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as safe.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made, and none are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** No challenge needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious or obfuscating elements. It serves as structural code within a larger project, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detectable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- The scoring aligns with the code's nature.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nThe code is safe, non-obfuscated, and carries no malware or security risk. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
