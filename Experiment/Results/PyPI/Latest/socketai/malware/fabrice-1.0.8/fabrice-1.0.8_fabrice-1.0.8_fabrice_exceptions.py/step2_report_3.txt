  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines four custom exception classes:\n     - `NothingToDo`\n     - `GroupException`\n     - `InvalidV1Env`\n   - Each class is straightforward, with minimal logic, primarily serving as error indicators.\n   - The classes include descriptive docstrings explaining their purpose.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code appears to be part of a larger project, likely for task management or environment validation.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n     - This is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk Score**:\n     - The risk score is 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - There are no logical flaws or security concerns.\n   - The comments suggest possible future refactoring but do not imply malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code is safe, standard, and well-structured.\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n   - No changes needed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is purely structural exception class definitions with no security concerns. The scores reflect this accurately.",
