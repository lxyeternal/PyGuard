  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code defines classes without input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are instantiated for error signaling but do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of simple exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The classes do not perform any operations beyond inheritance and storing a result object. The code is benign and typical for error handling in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, and confidence is high. No further action or modification is necessary.",
