{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and exception definitions (nothing to do, group exception, invalid environment exception).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing present; code only defines exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or data manipulation; purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, each with simple constructors or no methods. There are no data inputs, external data reads, or dangerous operations. The classes serve as error indicators without performing any logic beyond inheritance. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, safe definition of custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
