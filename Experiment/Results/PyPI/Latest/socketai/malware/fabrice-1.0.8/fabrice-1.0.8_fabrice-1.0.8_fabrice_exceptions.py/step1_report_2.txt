{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, including specialized exceptions for group errors, invalid environment configurations, and a placeholder exception.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception class definitions do not read input data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data transfer paths exist in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward and follows typical Python exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, each inheriting from Python's base Exception. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, and no use of dynamic code execution or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be part of a larger application and is purely structural, serving to define error handling behavior. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, consisting solely of class definitions for exceptions used elsewhere in the application. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are present.",
