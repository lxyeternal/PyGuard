  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent extension for remote task execution, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The only potential security concern relates to the handling of untrusted input in connection parameters, which is typical in such frameworks but should be validated externally. Overall, the code is safe and benign."
