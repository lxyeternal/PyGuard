  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in question is a series of import statements from local modules within a Python package.\n- There is no evidence of data processing, network activity, external input handling, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be a standard package module setup, likely an `__init__.py` or similar, exposing internal components for external use.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports concur on the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward import statements with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical flaws:** None. The code is standard and correct for its apparent purpose.\n- **Security flaws:** None. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic or obfuscated code, no external data handling.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no security risks.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there is no malicious or suspicious activity, scores of 0 are justified.\n- The code is purely structural, importing modules for package organization.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on static code review.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious import module.\n- No security issues or malware risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security concerns.",
