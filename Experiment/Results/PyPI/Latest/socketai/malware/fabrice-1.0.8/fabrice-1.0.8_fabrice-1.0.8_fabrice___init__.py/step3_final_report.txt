{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a package initialization or interface module, exposing internal components such as version info, connection configuration, runners, tasks, and executor functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or perform data leakage",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports internal modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's purpose appears to be setting up package components for external use. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the static analysis and the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
