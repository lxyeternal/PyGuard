  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules.\n- No data flow, user input, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: setting up package components, exposing internal modules, or initializing the package.\n\n**Malware and security risk assessment:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, indicating the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The scores seem appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- Since the code is purely import statements with no suspicious behavior, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Potential points of concern:**\n- The only consideration is whether import statements from local modules could be used maliciously. However, without further context or runtime behavior, this is unlikely.\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no signs of malware or security issues.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard package setup code.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is safe, with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
