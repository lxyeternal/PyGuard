{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules and classes within a package, likely setting up access to core functionalities and configurations.",
  "sources": "Module imports from local files (._version, .connection, .runners, .group, .tasks, .executor).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, network operations, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways; only static imports without runtime data handling or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements from internal modules, indicating modular design. It does not execute any logic or handle untrusted input. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors, are present. The structure appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py or main module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization script with no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It simply imports components for package functionality.",
