{
  "purpose": "This script configures and sets up a Python package called 'fabrice' or 'fabrice2', including dependency management, versioning, and entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), file reads (README.rst, _version.py), directory checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2'.",
  "sinks": "File operations (reading README and _version.py), executing code from _version.py, setting up package metadata and entry points, reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variable determines package and binary naming -> Directory checks influence package selection -> Reading _version.py file executes code to retrieve version -> setup() uses all collected data to configure the package.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The only notable action is executing '_version.py' with exec, which is standard for version retrieval but could be risky if the file contains malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks with standard practices such as reading version info, defining dependencies, and configuring entry points. The use of exec() to execute _version.py could be a concern if that file is malicious, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The environment variable influences package naming, which is typical for conditional builds. No obfuscated code or malware indicators are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no apparent malicious intent. The only minor risk is the execution of external code via exec(), which is typical for version management. There are no signs of malware or malicious activity. Overall, the script appears safe.",
