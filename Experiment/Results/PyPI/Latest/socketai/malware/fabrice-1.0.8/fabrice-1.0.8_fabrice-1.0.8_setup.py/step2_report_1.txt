  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the script as a setup configuration. The sources (environment variables, file reads, directory checks) are accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The use of `exec()` to read `_version.py` is noted, which is standard but potentially risky if the file is compromised.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of `exec()` is common but warrants caution.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a typical setup script with low risk (0.2) and no malware (0) is accurate.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 is reasonable, given the use of `exec()` but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar reasoning applies. The report correctly notes the use of environment variables, directory checks, and `exec()` for version loading.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected.  \n- The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, consistent with previous reports. The use of `exec()` is standard in setup scripts, not malicious.  \n- No signs of malware or obfuscation.  \n- Risk score of 0.2 remains appropriate.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 is suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar analysis. The key point is the `exec()` on `_version.py`, which is common but could be risky if the file is malicious.  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- Risk score of 0.2 remains valid.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Consistent with previous assessments. No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malware.  \n- The use of `exec()` is standard but should be handled cautiously.\n\n**Score suggestions:**  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0 across all reports.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated at 0.2 due to the use of `exec()` on `_version.py`, which is a common but potentially risky pattern if the version file is compromised.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable across all reports.  \n- No report indicates actual malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- The only minor concern is the use of `exec()`, which is standard but should be handled carefully.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard pattern, minimal risk if version file is trustworthy)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
