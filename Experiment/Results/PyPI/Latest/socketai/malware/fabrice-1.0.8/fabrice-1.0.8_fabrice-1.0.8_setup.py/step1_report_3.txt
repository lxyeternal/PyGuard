{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'fabrice' with conditional package selection based on environment variables and directory structure.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', reading 'README.rst', reading '_version.py', and static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'exec' to load version info, reading files, and setting up package installation and entry points.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences package name; reading version file feeds data into variable; setup configuration uses static and dynamic data for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution beyond 'exec' for version info, which is a common practice.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package using setuptools. It conditionally determines package names based on environment variables and directory presence, reads version info via 'exec', and configures package metadata and entry points. The use of 'exec' for loading version info is common in setup scripts and not inherently malicious. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. External dependencies are declared explicitly and are typical for such a package. The code's structure and logic are standard for packaging and do not indicate malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package without any signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It dynamically configures package parameters based on environment and directory structure, which is standard practice. No malware or security risks are detected.",
