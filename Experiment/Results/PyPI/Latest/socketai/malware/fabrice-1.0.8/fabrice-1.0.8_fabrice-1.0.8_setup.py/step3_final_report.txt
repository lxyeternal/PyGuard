  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'fabrice' Python package, managing environment-based package naming, version loading, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', directory checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2', reading '_version.py' file, README.rst file for long description.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing '_version.py', which could execute arbitrary code if compromised.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package and binary naming; reading '_version.py' via exec() sets version; setup() uses these parameters to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to evaluate '_version.py' is a common pattern but can be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with environment-dependent configuration and version loading via exec(). No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of exec() on '_version.py' is typical but warrants caution. No network activity or credential handling is observed. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's structure and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, well-structured setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of exec() for version loading, which is a common pattern but should be handled carefully. Overall, it poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
