  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script designed to perform a specific task, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to lack of context or comments.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, user input via input() function, or possibly external files or network sources (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Data could be sent over the network, written to files, or executed dynamically via eval()/exec() or subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like network transmission, file writing, or code execution functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic code execution (e.g., eval/exec), hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network connections would be anomalies; none explicitly identified without actual code. Unusual indentation or variable naming could also indicate obfuscation, but none apparent here.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is empty, with no apparent logic, functions, or data handling. As such, there are no observable sources, sinks, or flows. Without concrete code, no anomalies or malicious patterns can be detected. The lack of code prevents any definitive conclusions about obfuscation or malicious intent. This suggests the code might be incomplete or missing, limiting analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of any code content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears benign but is incomplete for a thorough review.",
