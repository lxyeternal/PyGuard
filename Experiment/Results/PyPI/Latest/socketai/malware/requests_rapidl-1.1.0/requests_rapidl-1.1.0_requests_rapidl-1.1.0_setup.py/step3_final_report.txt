{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect extensive user and system information during package installation, including username, hostname, OS details, IP addresses, and geolocation, and then exfiltrate this data to a remote server without user consent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from getpass.getuser(), socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), socket connection for local IP, network requests to api.ipify.org and ip-api.com for public IP and geolocation, and uses threading to initiate data transmission.",
  "sinks": "The data is sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded remote server URL (SERVER_URL) during the custom install command execution.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system info functions and network requests, stored in a dictionary, then serialized into JSON and transmitted through an HTTP request during the post-install phase executed by the custom setuptools command.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs automatic, unprompted data collection during installation, includes comments warning about illegal data collection, uses threading to send data asynchronously, and transmits sensitive information without user awareness or consent.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly collects user and system information, including IP addresses and geolocation, during package installation. It transmits this data to an external server using standard modules, with no obfuscation or code hiding. The comments indicate awareness of illegal or malicious intent. The use of threading to send data asynchronously may attempt to obscure or delay exfiltration. The data collection and transmission occur unconditionally, violating user privacy and security norms. The hardcoded server IP and the network requests introduce external dependencies and potential delays, but do not alter the malicious nature of the activity.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains highly malicious behavior, acting as spyware by covertly collecting and exfiltrating user/system data during installation. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, with comments explicitly warning about illegal data collection. The behavior poses a serious privacy and security threat, suitable for high malware and risk scores.",
