{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to collect user and system information during the installation of a Python package and send this data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from getpass.getuser(), socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), platform.release(), socket connections for IPs, and network requests to external APIs (api.ipify.org and ip-api.com).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to a remote server via HTTP POST request to the specified SERVER_URL, using urllib.request with the collected data payload.",
  "flows": "User/system info is gathered in collect_user_data(), then passed to send_data_to_server(), which sends it over HTTP to the remote SERVER_URL during the package's installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects extensive user/system information, including IPs and location, during installation without user consent. It uses threading to send data asynchronously, which may obscure data transmission. The comments explicitly warn about illegal data collection, indicating malicious intent. The data collection occurs automatically in a custom install command, not conditioned on user approval.",
  "analysis": "The script is a maliciously inclined package that secretly gathers user and device information, including IP addresses, hostname, OS details, and geolocation, and transmits it to an external server without explicit user consent. It employs standard Python modules and network requests, with no obfuscation or code hiding techniques. The data collection is embedded into a custom installation command that executes during package installation, with warnings in comments about illegal data collection. The threading approach may attempt to hide or delay the data transmission, which is suspicious. Overall, the script appears intentionally malicious for covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior by covertly collecting and transmitting detailed user and system information during package installation without user knowledge or consent. It is designed with clear intent to exfiltrate data to an external server, constituting a security threat. The code is not obfuscated but includes warnings indicating malicious intent. It should not be used, and the package is considered dangerous.",
