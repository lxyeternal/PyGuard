{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step which loads and executes code from a zip file during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, loading 'my.zip' via zipimporter, and executing 'my.hello()' within the test() function.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'module.hello()' which could potentially run malicious code if 'my.zip' is maliciously crafted or replaced.",
  "flows": "File read of 'README.md' -> creation of zipimporter for 'my.zip' -> loading 'my' module -> executing 'hello()' method in 'my' module.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically loads and executes a module from 'my.zip' during installation, which is unusual and potentially risky behavior. No hardcoded secrets are present, but executing code from an external zip file during install is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a markdown file for long description, then defines a test() function that loads a module from 'my.zip' using zipimport and executes its 'hello()' function. The custom install class runs this test() during installation, potentially executing untrusted code from 'my.zip'. The setup uses standard packaging practices but incorporates dynamic code execution at install time, which can be exploited if 'my.zip' is maliciously replaced or tampered with. No external network access or data leaks are evident. The code does not contain obfuscated elements or hardcoded credentials. The main concern is the execution of external code during installation, which could be malicious if the source of 'my.zip' is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary suspicious element is the dynamic loading and execution of code from 'my.zip' during installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. This pattern is unusual for typical setup scripts and poses a security risk if 'my.zip' is compromised or maliciously injected.",
