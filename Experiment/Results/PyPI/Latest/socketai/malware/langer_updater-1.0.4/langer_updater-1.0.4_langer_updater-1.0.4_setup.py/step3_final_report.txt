{
  "purpose": "The code loads and executes a module from 'my.zip' during package installation, specifically calling 'hello()' from the module.",
  "sources": "The 'test()' function reads 'my.zip' via zipimport and loads the 'my' module.",
  "sinks": "The execution of 'module.hello()' runs code from 'my.zip' without validation, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'my.zip' in 'test()', loads the module, then executes 'hello()' from it during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external code during setup without validation or sandboxing is highly unusual and risky.",
  "analysis": "The script reads 'README.md' for description, then defines 'test()' which loads 'my.zip' via zipimport, imports 'my', and calls 'hello()'. During the custom install command 'LangInstall', 'test()' is invoked, executing code from 'my.zip' without any validation, signature check, or sandboxing. This behavior is unconventional and introduces a significant security risk, as malicious code could be executed during installation. The scores from reports (malware 0.75, security risk 0.75-0.85) are justified given this behavior. No obfuscation is present. The main concern is executing untrusted code during setup, which can be exploited for supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes external code from 'my.zip' during installation without validation, posing a high security risk and potential for malicious activity. The behavior aligns with high malware and security risk scores, and should be flagged as a supply chain security concern.",
