  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs for tracking or data collection.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), MAC address retrieval via subprocess calls, random number generation for URL parameter, and encoding MAC addresses in base64.",
  "sinks": "Sending HTTP requests to external URLs with collected data via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC address are collected, encoded, and then transmitted via GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious external URLs that are non-standard and possibly malicious domains. Base64 encoding MAC addresses without clear purpose. No apparent use of the data internally, indicating possible data exfiltration. The URLs appear suspicious and are not typical for benign applications. The random number used in URL path may be for cache busting or obfuscation. No explicit user consent or encryption noted.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses through platform-specific commands. MAC addresses are encoded with base64, and then all data is sent via HTTP GET requests to external, suspicious domains. The code does not perform any data validation or encryption, and the external URLs do not appear related to legitimate services. The network requests are made silently within a try-except block, with exceptions suppressed, which can hinder detection. These behaviors suggest potential data exfiltration or tracking activities, especially considering the suspicious URL domains.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect host identifiers and transmit them to potentially malicious or suspicious domains without user consent. The use of unusual URLs and the silent data transmission raise security concerns. This behavior aligns with common patterns in malware or spyware that harvest system info for malicious purposes.",
