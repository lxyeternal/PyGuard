  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), platform.node(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which reads system interfaces for MAC addresses)",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls with constructed URLs that send collected data over HTTP GET requests",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) -> URL parameters -> HTTP requests sent to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external domains with suspicious TLDs (oast-cn, oast-row, oast.fun), base64 encoding of MAC addresses, no validation or filtering of data, no response handling beyond passing",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host-specific data such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across platforms. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, potentially to obfuscate their nature. The data is then sent via GET requests to three external URLs with obscure domain names, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The use of hardcoded URLs, base64 encoding, and data collection without any user consent or validation suggests malicious intent or tracking activity. There is no evidence of data processing or response handling beyond attempting to connect to external sites, which could indicate data exfiltration. No malicious code injections or obfuscation techniques are present outside normal Python usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for data collection and exfiltration, possibly for tracking or malicious surveillance, given the external domains and data encoding. No direct malware behavior like file modifications or network payloads is observed, but it does perform covert data transmission. Overall, the script exhibits suspicious behavior with a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
