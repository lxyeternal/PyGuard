{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and sends it to multiple remote URLs with encoded MAC addresses and other data as URL parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and collects MAC addresses via subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Uses urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs with constructed URL parameters, potentially exposing sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) flows into URL parameters, which are sent over HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated domain names, base64-encoding of MAC addresses, and automated data exfiltration attempts. The URLs appear suspicious and are associated with potentially malicious domains. No explicit user consent or notification is present.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system-specific data, including MAC addresses, and encodes MACs in base64, then transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains that are not well-known or trusted. The use of obfuscated domains and the pattern of data collection followed by silent transmission are common in malicious data exfiltration activities. The code contains no user prompts or logs, and exception handling suppresses errors, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection. The URLs are suspicious, likely malicious, and intended for covert communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system reconnaissance and exfiltrates sensitive information (host details and MAC addresses) to external servers without user consent. The suspicious domains, data encoding, and silent network communication indicate malicious behavior. The overall security risk is high.",
