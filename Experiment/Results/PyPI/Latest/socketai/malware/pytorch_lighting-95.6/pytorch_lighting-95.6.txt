      "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the execution of external code ('main()') during package installation, which can be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful logic. The scores should reflect a high likelihood of malicious behavior and high security risk, with no obfuscation present. This pattern warrants caution and further review of the 'main' module before trusting or deploying the package."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a covert data exfiltration tool that collects system information and transmits it to suspicious external domains. While it does not execute malicious payloads like code injection or file modification, its behavior indicates malicious intent, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The use of suspicious URLs, silent exception handling, and data encoding support classifying this as malicious or highly suspicious activity."
