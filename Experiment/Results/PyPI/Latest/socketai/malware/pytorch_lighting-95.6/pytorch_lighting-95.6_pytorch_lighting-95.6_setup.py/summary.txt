  "conclusion": "The primary security issue is the execution of external code ('main()') during package installation, which can be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful logic. The scores should reflect a high likelihood of malicious behavior and high security risk, with no obfuscation present. This pattern warrants caution and further review of the 'main' module before trusting or deploying the package."
