  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: an import statement from a local module related to Pyarmor.\n- The comments indicate the use of a trial version of Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation and licensing tool.\n- No data flows, sinks, or external communications are present.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident.\n- The code is standard for protected or obfuscated Python packages.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code itself is benign and aligns with typical obfuscation or licensing mechanisms.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or exploits are present.\n- The import is straightforward and from a trusted tool (Pyarmor).\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- **None** detected. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slight variation (0.2 vs. 0). Since the code is minimal and only an import, a low obfuscation score is justified.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (0.1), reflecting minimal risk associated with licensing or obfuscation code.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- The obfuscated score could be uniformly set at 0.2 across all reports, considering the comments and the nature of Pyarmor.\n- The security risk could be kept at 0.1, as it’s standard for such licensing code.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is appropriate; the code does not pose a security threat.\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) is reasonable, given the presence of obfuscation tools and comments indicating obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on all reports and analysis, my estimates are:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.2** (minimal obfuscation, standard for protected code)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, related to licensing/obfuscation, not security threat)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign component of a protected Python package using Pyarmor. No malicious or security risks are evident, and the scores should reflect this understanding.",
