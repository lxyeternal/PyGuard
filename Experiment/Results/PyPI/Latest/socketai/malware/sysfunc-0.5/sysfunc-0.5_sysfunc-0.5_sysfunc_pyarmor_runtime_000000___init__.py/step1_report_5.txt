{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ object from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime protection or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communications",
  "flows": "Import statement loads a runtime component; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a trial version comment and timestamp suggests code obfuscation or protection; no suspicious or malicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific runtime component from a local module, likely used for code protection or licensing enforcement. The comment indicates it's related to Pyarmor, a known code obfuscation tool, with a trial license. The code is minimal and standard for such a setup. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a legitimate runtime protection mechanism using Pyarmor. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minimal nature of the code limits false positives but also means limited scope for malicious activity.",
