  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: an import of `__pyarmor__` from `.pyarmor_runtime`.\n- The comments in each report indicate usage of Pyarmor (a legitimate code obfuscation and licensing tool), specifically a trial version with an expiration date.\n- No report mentions any suspicious code, network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n- The code is very minimal, consisting solely of an import statement, with no data processing, external communication, or other potentially risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  The code matches the description. It only imports a module; no issues or malicious code are evident.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify the purpose as related to Pyarmor licensing/obfuscation.\n- They appropriately note the absence of malicious activity, data flows, or suspicious behavior.\n- The mention of the trial license and expiration date is standard for such tools and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  The reports assign a low obfuscation score (~0.2). Given the minimal code and the mention of Pyarmor, which is used for obfuscation, this seems reasonable. The code itself is not obfuscated but is part of an obfuscated package.\n\n- **Malware:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is suggested or evident.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  The scores are low (~0.1), which seems appropriate considering the code's benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5. This is justified, as the code is minimal, legitimate, and lacks any malicious indicators.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since the code only imports a module related to Pyarmor, and no malicious behavior is indicated, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not seem to make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the purpose and nature of the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Given the context, perhaps slightly higher than 0.2, since the code is part of an obfuscated package, but the code snippet itself isn't obfuscated. I would suggest **0.2–0.3**.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2, as there's no evidence of malicious intent, just licensing/obfuscation.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- The code is benign, part of a protected or obfuscated package using Pyarmor.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present.\n- The minimal import statement and comments about trial licenses do not indicate any threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No signs of malicious behavior.                              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.2–0.3           | Part of an obfuscated package, but the snippet isn't obfuscated. |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1–0.2           | Very low; only licensing/obfuscation context.               |\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.**",
