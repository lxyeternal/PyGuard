{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for licensing or obfuscation purposes in a protected Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from the local module '.pyarmor_runtime' during import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication points are present; the code only imports a module.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads the __pyarmor__ object from the local module, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment indicating use of a trial version of Pyarmor with an expiration date, which is standard for obfuscation tools but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement from a local module associated with Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation and licensing tool. No malicious code, data leaks, network activity, or suspicious behavior are present. The comments about trial license and expiration are typical and do not imply malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious activity is detected. The obfuscation score is low (~0.2), reflecting the minimal code but acknowledging the context of obfuscation tools. The security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with the benign nature of licensing-related code. Overall, the code appears to be a standard component of an obfuscated or protected package, with no signs of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, related to licensing or obfuscation, with no malicious intent or activity. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
