{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime component, likely for code obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",
  "sources": "The code imports __pyarmor__ from a local module (.pyarmor_runtime).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates the use of Pyarmor trial version, which is a code obfuscation tool. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is evident. The presence of a version and expiration date suggests licensing enforcement but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module related to Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool. The comment notes the trial version and expiration date but does not imply malicious intent. There are no data flows, no suspicious code constructs, nor any embedded malicious logic. The code appears to be a standard part of a protected or obfuscated Python package that uses Pyarmor for licensing or protection purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal import statement related to Pyarmor obfuscation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a protected Python package using licensing or obfuscation features. No malware or security concerns are detected.",
