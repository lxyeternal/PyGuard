{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ module from the local pyarmor_runtime package, likely for runtime obfuscation or licensing verification purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; the code only performs an import",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a trial license comment and the import of a potentially obfuscation-related module (__pyarmor__); minimal code structure suggests obfuscation or licensing checks but not malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named __pyarmor__ from a relative package, which indicates the use of Pyarmor, a tool for code obfuscation and licensing enforcement. The comment indicates this is a trial version. There are no other operations, data handling, or network activity. The code appears to be part of a larger obfuscation or licensing scheme. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement related to Pyarmor licensing or obfuscation. There are no malicious indicators or security risks present in this minimal code fragment.",
