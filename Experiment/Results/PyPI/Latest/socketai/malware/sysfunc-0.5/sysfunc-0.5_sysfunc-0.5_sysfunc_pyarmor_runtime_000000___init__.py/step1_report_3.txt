{
  "purpose": "Importing the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for runtime code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing __pyarmor__ from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows leading to untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present in this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating trial version and expiration date; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing __pyarmor__ from a local module. The comment references Pyarmor's version, trial status, and expiration date, which are typical for licensing or obfuscation tools. No malicious activities, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears standard for a protected or obfuscated Python package using Pyarmor, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement associated with Pyarmor licensing or runtime protection. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
