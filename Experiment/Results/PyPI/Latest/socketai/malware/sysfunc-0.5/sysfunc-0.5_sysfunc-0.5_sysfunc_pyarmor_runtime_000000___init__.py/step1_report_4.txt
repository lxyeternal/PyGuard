{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ object from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for obfuscation or runtime protection purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted destinations",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways detected, as the code only performs an import operation",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating usage of Pyarmor with a trial license and a timestamp; no malicious code or obfuscation techniques apparent",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing __pyarmor__ from a local module. The comment references Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool, indicating this code may be part of an obfuscated or protected script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. The import alone is a standard operation, with no associated harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a component of an obfuscated or protected script using Pyarmor. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident.",
