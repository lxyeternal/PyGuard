  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, version, packages, include_package_data, description, author, python_requires, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted input or data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The 'python_requires' field set to '==3.13.*', which is unconventional as Python 3.13 is not yet released; this could cause installation issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup configuration with no dynamic code, input handling, or network activity. The only notable anomaly is the version specifier '==3.13.*', which is invalid or at least non-standard, potentially leading to installation failures. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk score is slightly above zero (0.1) due to the version specifier anomaly, but this does not constitute a security threat. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script. The only concern is the unusual Python version requirement, which may cause compatibility issues but does not pose a security risk or indicate malicious activity. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0, and the security risk score should be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
