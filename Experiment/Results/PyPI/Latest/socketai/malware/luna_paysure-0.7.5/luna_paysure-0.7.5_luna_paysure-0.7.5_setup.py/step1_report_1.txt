  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'luna_paysure'.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, author details, description, and package discovery settings.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The data flows from hardcoded package metadata into the setup() function to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static metadata including package name, version, author info, description, classifiers, and Python version requirement. All data is hardcoded and standard for Python package configuration. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The code appears to be a typical package setup script without obfuscated code or external data sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
