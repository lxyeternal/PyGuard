  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static source code defining package name, version, author info, description, and package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data influence present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears to be standard setup configuration without suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, and description, and uses find_packages() for package discovery. It adheres to common Python packaging practices. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The setup configuration appears legitimate and typical for open-source Python packages. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and no obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup.py script for Python package distribution, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and typical of open-source package setup files.",
