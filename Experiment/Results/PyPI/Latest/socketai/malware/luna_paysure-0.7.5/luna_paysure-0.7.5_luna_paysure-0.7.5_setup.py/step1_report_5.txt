  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'luna_paysure' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() call: name, version, author, author_email, description, packages, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks in this code, as it solely defines package metadata and uses standard setuptools functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is typical for a setup.py configuration with no suspicious logic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, a standard library for packaging Python projects. It calls setup() with static parameters such as package name, version, author info, description, packages found via find_packages(), classifiers, and required Python version. All data are hardcoded string literals with no dynamic or user input. There are no functions or code that execute runtime logic beyond static configuration. The structure is conventional for packaging and does not contain any malicious behavior, code injection, or hidden functions. No external or untrusted data sources are involved, and there are no indicators of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py script is a standard package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical example of a safe package setup script.",
