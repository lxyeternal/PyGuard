  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, author, author_email, description, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, user input, or runtime data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and conventional for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, defines package metadata statically, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic code, external data sources, or runtime logic are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the static, standard nature of the script. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or external communications are detected. The code is typical for open-source Python packages and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup.py script with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, straightforward structure.",
