  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and setup configuration for the 'luna_paysure' Python package.",
  "sources": "None; all configuration data is hardcoded within the setup script.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used or processed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script solely provides static package metadata without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The script uses standard setuptools setup procedures with straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools modules and calls setup() with static parameters defining package name, version, author info, description, package discovery, classifiers, and Python version requirements. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets or code injection mechanisms. The package metadata appears normal and typical for Python package distribution. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard configuration for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The package metadata is typical, and no anomalies are detected.",
