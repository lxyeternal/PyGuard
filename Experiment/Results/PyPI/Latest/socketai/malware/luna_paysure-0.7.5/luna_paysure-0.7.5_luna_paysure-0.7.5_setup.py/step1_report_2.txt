  "purpose": "Setup script for configuring the 'luna_paysure' Python package, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for package name, version, author, email, description, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only initializes package metadata without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code, and no dynamic execution or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata such as name, version, author, and classifiers. The find_packages() function is used to discover packages automatically. The code contains only static strings and straightforward function calls. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a legitimate package configuration file.",
