  "flows": "source functions retrieve data, data is passed directly to the requests.post call",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation; code straightforward; privacy-sensitive data transmitted without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves hostname, local IP, and external IP, then sends this info via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials (besides the webhook URL, which is expected). The behavior is passive data collection and reporting, primarily raising privacy concerns. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity is present. The malware score should be 0, as there is no malicious intent. The security risk score reflects privacy implications but not active threats. The code is simple and clear, with no obfuscation. Overall, the code is benign but privacy-sensitive.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs passive system info gathering and external reporting without malicious intent. It should be scored with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) due to privacy concerns. The behavior is straightforward and not malicious, though privacy implications should be noted.",
