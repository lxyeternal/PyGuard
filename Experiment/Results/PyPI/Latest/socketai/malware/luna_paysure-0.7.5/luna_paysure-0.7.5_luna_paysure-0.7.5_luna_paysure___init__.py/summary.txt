  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily for informational or monitoring purposes. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main concern is privacy, as it transmits system info externally without user consent. The scores are appropriate; a risk score around 0.4 would accurately reflect the moderate privacy risk, but overall, the code is not malicious."
