  "purpose": "Collects hostname, local IP, and external IP, then posts this info to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(hostname), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.post to Slack webhook URL",
  "flows": "hostname/IPs are retrieved from system functions and sent directly via HTTP POST to external URL",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets besides webhook URL, straightforward data collection and transmission",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves system information (hostname, local IP, external IP) and transmits it to an external Slack webhook. All sources and sinks are legitimate and expected. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The data transmission could be privacy-invasive if done without user consent but does not constitute malicious activity. The code is simple, with clear intent, and no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk between 0.2 and 0.5) are consistent with this analysis. The higher risk scores reflect potential privacy concerns rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and primarily for informational or monitoring purposes. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main concern is privacy, as it transmits system info externally without user consent. The scores are appropriate; a risk score around 0.4 would accurately reflect the moderate privacy risk, but overall, the code is not malicious.",
