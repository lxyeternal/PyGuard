  "flows": "Retrieve hostname and local IP -> Fetch external public IP -> Send hostname, local IP, and public IP to Slack webhook",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits local network information to an external service without any apparent user consent or validation; use of a Slack webhook URL may be intended for remote notification, but lacks context or encryption indicators. The message content is benign but could be used for reconnaissance or exfiltration if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers the system's hostname and local IP address via socket functions, then retrieves the public IP address by querying an external API (api.ipify.org). It then posts this collected data to a Slack webhook URL in a JSON payload. All operations are standard library and open-source requests usage; no suspicious or malicious functions, code injection, or obfuscated elements are present. The data transmission is straightforward, but sending system info externally without user awareness could be considered privacy-sensitive. No malware or malicious behavior is detected, but the pattern of data exfiltration warrants caution.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic information gathering and sends it to an external endpoint, which could be benign or potentially malicious depending on context. There is no clear malicious intent or malware present, but it could be used for reconnaissance. Overall, the behavior is not inherently malicious but should be reviewed for privacy implications.",
