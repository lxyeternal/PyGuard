  "purpose": "The code defines a simple function to print 'hello world' and executes it if the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output via print(), no untrusted data involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; function call directly outputs static string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script contains a basic function that prints a static message. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, no network connections, and no security-sensitive operations. It lacks any code that could be malicious or maliciously manipulated. The code is minimal, clear, and free of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a simple demonstration or test script.",
