{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package but secretly establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, but it contains hardcoded IP address and port for reverse shell connection, and executes a system command.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a base64-decoded reverse shell command, which connects back to a remote server and spawns a shell.",
  "flows": "The reverse shell command is base64-encoded, decoded in the shell, and executed, establishing a connection from the target system to the attacker-controlled server.",
  "anomalies": "Embedding a reverse shell inside the setup script, hardcoded attacker IP and port, encoding and executing a malicious shell command within the setup process, unusual use of base64 encoding for obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the installation process via a custom 'install' class. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command pointing to a hardcoded IP and port, encodes it with base64 for obfuscation, and executes it via os.system(). This results in the target machine connecting back to the attacker's server and providing shell access. The setup script itself appears legitimate but contains malicious intent embedded in the post-installation step, which is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by installing a reverse shell that connects back to a remote server during setup. The use of obfuscation, hardcoded attacker details, and execution of malicious commands classify this as highly malicious.",
