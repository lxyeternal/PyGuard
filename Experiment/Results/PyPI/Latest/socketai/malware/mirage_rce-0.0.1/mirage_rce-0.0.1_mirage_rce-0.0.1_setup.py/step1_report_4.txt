{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and, during installation, establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP address and port.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command constructed within the run method, which is executed via os.system after base64 decoding.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that executes the decoded base64 reverse shell command, which spawns a reverse shell connection.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, establishing a network connection back to the specified LHOST and LPORT.",
  "anomalies": "Embedded hardcoded IP address and port within the reverse shell command; execution of dynamically constructed command during installation; obfuscated command via base64 encoding; the presence of reverse shell payload within setup script.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports necessary modules and defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command that connects back to a hardcoded IP (124.221.70.199) on port 8876. This command is encoded in base64 and then decoded and executed via os.system, resulting in an immediate reverse shell upon installation. The code’s primary malicious behavior is the embedded reverse shell payload triggered during setup, which is hidden through base64 encoding, indicating intent to evade casual inspection. The code does not use external input but uses hardcoded values to initiate a potentially malicious network connection, suggesting malicious intent or backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to establish a reverse shell connection during package installation. The hardcoded IP and port, along with the dynamic execution of encoded commands, strongly indicate malicious intent. It is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous, warranting immediate review and removal.",
