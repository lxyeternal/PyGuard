{
  "purpose": "The code installs a Python package and, during installation, executes a reverse shell connecting to a hardcoded IP and port, indicating malicious backdoor behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP ('124.221.70.199') and port (8876), constructs a command string, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system().",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 command is executed with os.system(), which initiates a network connection back to the attacker, establishing a reverse shell.",
  "flows": "Source: hardcoded IP/port and command string -> base64 encoding -> decoding during run() -> os.system() execution -> reverse shell connection to attacker.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious command; execution of reverse shell during package installation; hardcoded attacker IP and port embedded in code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon execution, constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP and port, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system(), resulting in a reverse shell connection. The behavior is malicious, as it enables remote control of the host during package installation. The obfuscation via base64 is straightforward but effective enough to hide the command. The code contains no external input, and the malicious activity is explicit and embedded in the setup process, representing a severe supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, executing a reverse shell during installation with hardcoded attacker details and minimal obfuscation. It constitutes a high-severity security threat and should be flagged accordingly.",
