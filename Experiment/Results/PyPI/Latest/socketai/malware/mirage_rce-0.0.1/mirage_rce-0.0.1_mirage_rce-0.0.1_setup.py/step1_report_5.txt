{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell to a specified IP and port.",
  "sources": "The IP address and port are hardcoded; the reverse shell command is constructed and executed during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded string that opens a reverse shell connection, which can lead to remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "The setup script runs the CustomInstall class; during installation, it constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it, establishing a remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a reverse shell payload embedded directly into the install process, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The hardcoded IP and port suggest malicious intent. Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the command indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package setup process. The CustomInstall class overrides the run method to execute malicious code: it constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system. This process establishes a remote connection to an attacker-controlled server, enabling remote command execution. The use of hardcoded IP and port, along with obfuscation via base64, strongly indicates malicious intent. The code is designed to trigger during package installation, making it a supply chain attack vector. The code does not appear to include any benign or legitimate functionality; all actions point towards malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious. It implements a reverse shell that activates upon package installation, using obfuscation techniques to conceal its intent. The hardcoded IP and port, combined with the execution of a reverse shell, confirm a high likelihood of malicious activity intended to compromise the host system.",
