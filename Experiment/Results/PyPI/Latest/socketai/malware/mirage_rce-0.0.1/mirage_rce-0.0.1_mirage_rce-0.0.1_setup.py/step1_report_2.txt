{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python package named 'mirage_rce' with a custom installation step that executes a reverse shell command.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP address and port, constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded shell command that opens a reverse shell connection to a remote IP and port.",
  "flows": "The script constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP/port, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, establishing a network connection to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded IP address and port for a reverse shell, encodes and executes it dynamically, and triggers this behavior during package installation. The reverse shell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding, and executed in a way that can hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup from setuptools and defines a CustomInstall class overriding the run method. During installation, it creates a reverse shell command targeting IP 124.221.70.199 on port 8876, encodes this command in base64, and executes it in the shell via os.system. This results in establishing a reverse shell connection to an external IP during package installation, which is a clear malicious behavior intended for remote code execution and control. The code is straightforward in its malicious intent, using obfuscation to hide the command and executing it automatically. The use of hardcoded IP and port indicates intent to connect to a specific external host, which is typical in malicious backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious activity by executing a reverse shell during package installation, representing a supply chain attack vector. It is highly suspicious and dangerous, indicating malicious behavior designed to compromise the host system.",
