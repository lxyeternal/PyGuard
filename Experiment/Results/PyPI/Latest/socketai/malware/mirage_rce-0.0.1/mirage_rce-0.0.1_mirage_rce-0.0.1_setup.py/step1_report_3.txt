{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step which attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP address ('124.221.70.199') and port (8876), and generates a reverse shell command that is base64-encoded and executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The encoded reverse shell command is decoded and executed in the shell, establishing a network connection to the attacker-controlled server, enabling remote command execution.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP and port, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP address and port for reverse shell; execution of encoded commands during package setup; use of os.system for executing shell commands, which can be unsafe; code does not provide any user consent or indication.",
  "analysis": "The setup script overrides the install command to run a reverse shell connection upon installation. It hardcodes an IP address and port, constructs a reverse shell payload, encodes it in base64, and executes the decoded command using os.system. This behavior is malicious, as it secretly establishes a remote connection without user knowledge. The code demonstrates clear malicious intent, with no legitimate purpose for such functionality in a standard setup script. The use of base64 encoding and runtime execution of shell commands is indicative of obfuscation and malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior designed to establish a reverse shell during package installation. It hardcodes remote server details and executes shell commands covertly, representing a serious security risk. It should be considered highly malicious and should not be used.",
