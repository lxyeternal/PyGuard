  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations beyond reading README.md.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package metadata without dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script defining package info, dependencies, and metadata. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscated segments, or runtime behaviors are present. The reports provided are empty, indicating no identified issues or concerns. Given the lack of evidence, the package appears benign. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be zero, consistent with the absence of suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is standard and safe. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected based on the provided code and reports. The overall security risk is minimal, and the package can be considered benign.",
