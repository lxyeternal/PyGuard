  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  The code is `from .info import *`. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident in this line alone. The concern is the wildcard import, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is sound. Wildcard imports are discouraged for clarity and security reasons but are not inherently malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct, no malicious activity detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct, no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to poor practice, but not a significant security risk.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same as above; no malicious activity, just a standard import.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is consistent. The high confidence (0.9) is justified given the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — Appropriate, minimal concern.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same as previous; straightforward import with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The reasoning is correct; the confidence is perfect (1.0).\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  The same import pattern; no malicious activity observed.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The concern about wildcard import obscurity is valid but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to poor practice but not security-critical.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Correct reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue Confirmed?**  \n  Same as above; no malicious activity evident.\n\n- **Errors or Flaws?**  \n  The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple relative import with no malicious behavior. The primary concern across reports is the use of `from .info import *`, which is discouraged but not malicious.\n\n**Considering the cumulative evidence:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All zero, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All zero, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly elevated (0.1-0.2) due to poor practice, but nothing indicating a security breach.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable.\n- The only potential adjustment is perhaps to set the **security risk score** slightly higher (e.g., 0.3) if the context suggests that the 'info' module could be compromised, but based solely on this snippet, that’s speculative.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Clear code.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Reflects poor practice but not an active security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The main concern is coding style, not security. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.",
