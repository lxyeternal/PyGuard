  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which loads code from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this line; it only imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can obscure which symbols are imported, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement. This line alone does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other operations. Without additional context or code, there is no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The import may be part of a larger legitimate module.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal and standard, though the use of 'import *' can be discouraged for clarity but is not malicious.",
