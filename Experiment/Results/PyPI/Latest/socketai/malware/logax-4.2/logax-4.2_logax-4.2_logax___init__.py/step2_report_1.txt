  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations:**\n- The code is a simple relative import with a wildcard (`*`) from a local module `info`.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or explicit malicious code is present in this line.\n- The primary concern with such import statements is the use of `*`, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the `info` module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the use of wildcard import as a concern for obscurity and potential malicious hiding.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior evident, but recommends reviewing `info`.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The low malware score aligns with the code, but the risk score reflects the concern over wildcard import.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, notes no malicious activity, standard practice.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. High confidence and low risk/malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Confirms benign nature, standard import.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. Very high confidence and zero risk/malware.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the potential for obscuring malicious code but states no malicious behavior in this snippet.\n- **Conclusion:** No evident malicious activity, only concern over wildcard import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.3\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The low confidence reflects uncertainty, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from `info`.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, standard import.\n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0, confidence=0.4\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The risk is minimal, and malware score is zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as a simple import statement.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting the concern over wildcard import.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Recommendations:**\n\n- The **use of `from .info import *`** is generally discouraged because it can hide imported symbols, making security analysis harder. However, **nothing in the code itself indicates malicious intent**.\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** unless there's evidence that the `info` module is malicious, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n- The **obfuscated score** is correctly zero; there's no obfuscation.\n- The **risk score** could be slightly increased if we consider the wildcard import as a security concern, but since it's a common pattern and no malicious activity is evident, keeping it low is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores:** I agree with most scores, especially malware=0 and obfuscated=0.\n- **Risk score:** Should remain low, around 0.1-0.2, due to the wildcard import concern but no active threat.\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is benign; the primary concern is coding style rather than security.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minor concern over wildcard import)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the context provided.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign import statement with a minor stylistic concern. No evidence suggests malicious intent or active security risk.",
