  "flows": "No data flow observable in this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported contents and potentially hide malicious code or unintended side effects",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of all contents from a module named 'info'. Wildcard imports are generally discouraged because they make it difficult to track which names are imported and can inadvertently import malicious or unintended code if the module is compromised. Since this is only a single import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation within this line. However, without inspecting the 'info' module itself, the potential risk depends on its contents. The use of 'from .info import *' alone is not malicious but is considered poor practice in secure coding standards.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of wildcard import, which can obscure the actual imported content and potentially hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised. Further review of the 'info' module is recommended to fully assess security risk.",
