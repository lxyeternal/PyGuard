{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'info', likely to access specific functions, variables, or configurations defined there.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the module 'info' in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks in this single line of code; it only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "The import operation may load code or data from 'info', but with no further code, no data flow occurs beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .info import *' can be considered suspicious due to its tendency to obscure imported symbols, potentially hiding malicious code or backdoors. However, this alone is not definitive evidence of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a relative import of all symbols from the 'info' module. As a minimal snippet, it does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks by itself. The use of '*' in import statements can be problematic for code clarity and maintenance but is not inherently malicious. Without additional context or content of 'info', further analysis cannot be performed. The code could be benign or could hide malicious code within the imported module. The overall security assessment is limited due to minimal information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious activity. The only potential concern is the use of a wildcard import, which may hide or obscure imported code. No malicious behavior or security risks are explicitly indicated in this snippet.",
