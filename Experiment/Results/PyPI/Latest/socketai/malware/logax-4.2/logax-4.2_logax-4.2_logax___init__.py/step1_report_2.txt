  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'info'",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'info'",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "Potentially imports data or functions from 'info', but no flow is visible in this minimal code",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can obscure what is imported, but this is common in package __init__.py files or modules designed for simplicity; no malicious activity evident",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax, importing everything from the 'info' module. There is no embedded malicious code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors within this single line. Since this is a minimal snippet, it does not provide information about what 'info' contains, but the import statement itself is standard and not malicious. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a common pattern in Python modules for importing all contents from a local module.",
