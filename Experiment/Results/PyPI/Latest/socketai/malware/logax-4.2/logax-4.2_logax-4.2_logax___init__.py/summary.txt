  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard, with the only concern being the use of 'import *'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score should remain at 0, and the risk score can be kept low (~0.1-0.2) due to coding style considerations. Overall, the code poses no active security threat."
