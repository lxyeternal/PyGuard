  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported contents.\n- No signs of malicious behavior within the snippet itself.\n- The risk score is 0.2, which seems appropriate given the concern about obscurity.\n- Malware score is 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Confidence is moderate (0.6), which is reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also notes the use of 'from .info import *', but emphasizes the lack of malicious activity.\n- High confidence (0.9), which is justified.\n- Malware score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous reports, stating it's a benign import.\n- Confidence is 1.0, indicating certainty.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Recognizes the potential concern with wildcard import obscuring symbols.\n- Notes that without further context, no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n- Confidence is low (0.3), which is appropriate given the limited information.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Valid and cautious. No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, stating no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- Confidence is 0.4, reflecting some uncertainty.\n- Malware score is 0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple relative import statement.\n- The primary concern across reports is the use of wildcard import ('*'), which can hide malicious code if the 'info' module is compromised.\n- None of the reports suggest any actual malicious activity or obfuscation within the import statement itself.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the limited scope and lack of evidence.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- Since the actual 'info' module content isn't available, the security risk remains minimal based solely on this import statement.\n- For a more thorough security assessment, inspecting the 'info' module's contents is necessary.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code in the import statement)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to the wildcard import obscurity, which can be risky if the module is compromised)\n\n**Summary:** The import statement itself is benign but warrants caution due to the wildcard import pattern. Further review of the 'info' module is recommended for a comprehensive security assessment.",
