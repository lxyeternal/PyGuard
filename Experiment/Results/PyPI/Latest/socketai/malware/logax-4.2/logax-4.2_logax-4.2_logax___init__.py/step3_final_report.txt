  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'info' using a relative import.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, potentially hiding malicious code if 'info' is compromised, but no actual malicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import with a wildcard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious code is evident. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide symbols and obscure code behavior, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this import, assigning malware scores of 0 and low risk scores (around 0.1-0.2). The confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. Without inspecting the 'info' module, the security risk remains minimal. The code's structure is straightforward, and no obfuscation or malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and standard, with the only concern being the use of 'import *'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score should remain at 0, and the risk score can be kept low (~0.1-0.2) due to coding style considerations. Overall, the code poses no active security threat.",
