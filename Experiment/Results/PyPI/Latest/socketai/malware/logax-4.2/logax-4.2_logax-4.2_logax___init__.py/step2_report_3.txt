  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs a **relative import** of all contents from a local module named `info`.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to **namespace pollution** and **obscurity** of imported symbols.\n- There are **no direct malicious behaviors** (e.g., network calls, file manipulations, dynamic code execution) within this single line.\n- The **security risk** depends heavily on the contents of the `info` module, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the use of wildcard import as poor practice and potential risk if `info` is compromised.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, as it's just an import statement.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 — moderate confidence.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes that the import is standard and not malicious.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, minimal concern.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n- **Assessment:** Justified; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Confirms the import is benign and standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — very high.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Notes the potential concern with `import *` obscuring imported symbols, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to potential obscurity issues.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 — low to moderate.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; the concern about obscurity is valid, but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous, highlights that it's a standard import with no evident malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the import statement itself is straightforward, with no malicious behavior detected. The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide malicious code if the `info` module is compromised, but this cannot be confirmed without inspecting `info`.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports:**  \n  The reports generally acknowledge the potential risks of wildcard imports but correctly conclude that, in isolation, this line is not malicious. No false positives or logical errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the limited code snippet. The risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal immediate threat but acknowledging the potential for issues if `info` is malicious.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  Since no malicious code or obfuscation is present in the snippet, higher scores are unwarranted. The only caveat is the potential risk if `info` is compromised, but that is outside the scope of this single line.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 — minimal, mainly due to the use of `import *` which can hide malicious content if the module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\nThe import statement itself is benign and standard, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The main concern is the use of wildcard import, which is a best practice issue rather than a security vulnerability. Without inspecting the `info` module, the security risk remains low.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in the reports, with a slight emphasis on the potential issues caused by `import *`.",
