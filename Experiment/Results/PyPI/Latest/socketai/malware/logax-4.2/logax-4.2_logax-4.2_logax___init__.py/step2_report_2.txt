  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code snippet, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports are about a simple relative import with a wildcard (`*`).\n- No additional code or context is provided.\n- The main concern with such import statements is the use of `*`, which can obscure what symbols are imported and potentially hide malicious code if the module is compromised.\n- No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation is present in the snippet itself.\n- The security risk largely depends on the contents of the `info` module, which is not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies the use of wildcard import as poor practice, potential obscurity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is reasonable given no evidence.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, which seems slightly high for such a benign import but reflects concern about obscurity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6 — moderate confidence, appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No issues; the assessment is fair.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, correctly states no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence that the code is benign.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states the import is benign and standard.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0, indicating no concern, which is justified.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — full confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Sound.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Recognizes the potential concern with `import *` but notes no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, consistent with cautious approach.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 — low, reflecting uncertainty about the contents of `info`.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to others, notes no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.4 — moderate confidence.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores vary from 0 to 0.2, which aligns with the general caution about wildcard imports but no actual evidence of malicious intent.\n- Confidence levels are appropriate based on the minimal context.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code itself is harmless; the main concern is the use of `import *`, which can be risky if the imported module is malicious or compromised.\n- Since no evidence of malicious behavior exists, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n- The risk score could be slightly increased if the `info` module is from an untrusted source, but without evidence, keeping it low is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My final recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (small concern due to wildcard import, but generally benign)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with the only minor concern being the use of `import *`. No changes are necessary to the scores based on the provided information.",
