  "purpose": "The code is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python library named 'logax'.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; loads dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or output; no untrusted data effects identified.",
  "flows": "Reads file input (README.md) to set long description; installs dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup procedures from 'setuptools' to prepare a Python package. It reads a README file for description and specifies package dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code adheres to typical package setup practices, with no anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It performs typical package configuration tasks safely.",
