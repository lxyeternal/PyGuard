{
  "purpose": "Import the 'color' module from the 'colorama' package, likely for colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing external package 'colorama'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flows or external outputs are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed beyond import; no untrusted input handling or data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a well-known package used for terminal text coloring. It does not include any functions, data processing, or network operations. The import appears standard and harmless. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The package 'colorama' is commonly used for aesthetic purposes in terminal applications and does not inherently contain malicious code. The minimal code makes it impossible to identify malicious intent or security risks without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a module for terminal coloring, which is a common practice in Python CLI applications.",
