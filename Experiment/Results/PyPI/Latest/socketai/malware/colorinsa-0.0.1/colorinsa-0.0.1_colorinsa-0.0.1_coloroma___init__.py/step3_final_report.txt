  "purpose": "To evaluate the security implications of the Python import statement 'from colorama import color' in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no additional data sources or input points are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present, as the code only imports a module attribute without further processing.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code merely imports a module attribute without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present in the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a well-known library (colorama). There are no functions, data handling, or network activities involved. The import of 'color' from 'colorama' is common for terminal styling and does not indicate malicious intent. The confidence in benignity is high (0.9+). Malware score is 0, as there is no malicious behavior. Security risk score is 0, given the lack of any suspicious activity or vulnerabilities. Obfuscation score is 0, as the code is clear and simple. The minimal code and lack of suspicious features support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
