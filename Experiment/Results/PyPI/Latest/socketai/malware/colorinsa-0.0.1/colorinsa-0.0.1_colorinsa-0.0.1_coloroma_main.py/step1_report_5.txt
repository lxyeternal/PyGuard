  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then sends this information to a specified Discord webhook.",
  "sources": [
    "get_public_ip() - makes an HTTP request to retrieve public IP",
    "get_system_info() - reads system info via environment variables, subprocess, and requests",
    "find_discord_tokens() - reads local storage files for Discord tokens",

  "anomalies": [
    "The code collects system info, tokens, passwords, and account data without user consent, indicating potentially malicious intent.",
    "The use of subprocess to get HWID via 'wmic' command may be considered intrusive.",
    "Reading Chrome passwords and Discord tokens suggests targeted data theft.",
    "The data is sent to an external webhook, which could be used for exfiltration.",
    "No obfuscation present but the combined activities are suspicious for malware-like behavior."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script consolidates multiple suspicious activities: it retrieves sensitive system data (public IP, HWID, username), extracts Discord tokens from local storage files, accesses Chrome's saved passwords, and reads Minecraft account information from known config files. All this data is transmitted to a remote webhook, indicating exfiltration of potentially private and sensitive information. The use of system commands and direct file reading, especially for passwords, points towards malicious intent aimed at data theft. The code does not perform any malicious actions like system modification or malware delivery but is clearly designed to harvest and send sensitive data surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high malicious intent by exfiltrating sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, browser passwords, system info, and game accounts to an external webhook. While it doesn't directly harm the system or deploy malware, it compromises user privacy and security, warranting a security alert and caution in usage.",
