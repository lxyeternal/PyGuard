{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then send this information to a specified webhook.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, reading files from specific directories (discord, Chrome, Brave, Edge, Minecraft configs), database query for Chrome passwords, subprocess execution for HWID, and network request to fetch public IP.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, file reads, subprocess, database query) -> collected data in variables -> send_to_webhook function -> HTTP POST request to external webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive data (Discord tokens, browser passwords, system info, Minecraft credentials) without user consent and transmits it to an external webhook, indicating malicious intent. Usage of subprocess to get HWID and environment variables for user info suggest tracking. No data validation or user notification is present. The script appears to be designed for credential harvesting.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves various sensitive data including Discord tokens, stored browser passwords, system info, and Minecraft accounts. It then sends all this data to a specified Discord webhook URL. The code does not perform any user consent, validation, or encryption for the data transmission, which indicates malicious intent. The data collection methods involve reading from specific directories, querying a local database for passwords, and executing system commands to obtain hardware ID. The data exfiltration via webhook is a typical indicator of a malicious or maliciously intended tool. There is no legitimate purpose apparent for this data collection, and it aligns with typical credential and information harvesting malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior focused on credential theft and information exfiltration without user consent. It collects sensitive system, application, and credential data and sends it externally. The overall intent appears to be malicious, with high confidence, and the risk level is extremely high.",
