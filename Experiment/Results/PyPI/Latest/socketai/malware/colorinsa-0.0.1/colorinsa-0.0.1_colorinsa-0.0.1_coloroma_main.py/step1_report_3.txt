  ],
  "flows": [
    "System info, Discord tokens, passwords, and Minecraft account data are gathered in separate functions.",
    "The data is then sent asynchronously to the webhook via multiple calls to send_to_webhook(), each transmitting different data types."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "The code reads sensitive data such as Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts without user consent.",
    "No user prompts or permissions are requested before data collection.",
    "The code encodes passwords with base64 but does not decrypt encrypted passwords, which might be a limitation or attempt to obfuscate.",
    "The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential command-and-control or data exfiltration."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a data exfiltration tool. It collects various sensitive user data: system info, Discord tokens, stored browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts. These data are then sent to an external Discord webhook, which is typically used for malicious data theft or malware operations. The use of system commands, reading configuration files, and network requests are all typical behaviors of malware designed for credential theft. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as damaging files or executing malicious payloads; its main purpose appears to be covert data harvesting. The hardcoded webhook and absence of user interaction or permission checks suggest malicious intent. The overall structure is straightforward and does not appear obfuscated, but the purpose of the data collection is clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a credential-stealing and data exfiltration malware targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, and game account data. It exfiltrates collected data to a remote webhook without user consent, indicating malicious intent. The code's structure is clear, and no obfuscation techniques are evident. It poses a high security risk due to its data theft behavior.",
