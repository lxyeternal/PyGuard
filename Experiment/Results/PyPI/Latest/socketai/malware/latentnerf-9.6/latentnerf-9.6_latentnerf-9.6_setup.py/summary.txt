  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of external code ('main()') during installation poses a serious security risk, as it can be exploited to run malicious payloads. The current reports correctly identify this behavior as suspicious and assign high malware and risk scores. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious intent if 'main()' is malicious, with a malware score around 0.75 and a security risk score around 0.8. This pattern should be treated with caution, and such packages should be scrutinized or avoided unless the 'main' module is verified safe."
