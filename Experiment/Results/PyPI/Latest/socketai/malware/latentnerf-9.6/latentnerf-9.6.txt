      "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of external code ('main()') during installation poses a serious security risk, as it can be exploited to run malicious payloads. The current reports correctly identify this behavior as suspicious and assign high malware and risk scores. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious intent if 'main()' is malicious, with a malware score around 0.75 and a security risk score around 0.8. This pattern should be treated with caution, and such packages should be scrutinized or avoided unless the 'main' module is verified safe."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data collection and exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains, with minimal obfuscation and stealthy network requests. While it does not contain destructive payloads, its intent to silently gather and transmit system information classifies it as malicious activity with high security implications."
