  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading platform details, system command outputs for MAC addresses, environment variables (hostname, username, current directory).",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs with system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, base64-encoded MAC addresses) collected from sources are URL-encoded and sent via GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious or obfuscated URLs; encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission; no obvious user interaction or explicit consent; no data validation on responses; silent failure handling.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers device-specific identifiers such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses with base64 and transmits this data to several external URLs. The URLs are obscure and likely malicious or tracking domains. The data transmission occurs without user awareness or consent. The code employs standard libraries but combines them in a way typical of data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities. No signs of malicious payload execution or system damage are present; however, the data collection and external communication suggest malicious intent or at least malicious profiling. The lack of response validation or further data handling indicates this is primarily tracking or surveillance activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily performs system information collection and transmits it covertly to suspicious external URLs, indicating malicious intent related to tracking or reconnaissance. While it does not execute malicious payloads or system damage, its data exfiltration behavior poses a security risk.",
