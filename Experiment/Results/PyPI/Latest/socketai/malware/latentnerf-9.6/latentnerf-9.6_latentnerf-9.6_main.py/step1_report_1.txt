  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (system commands for MAC addresses), and random.randint() for generating rd_num.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data via HTTP GET requests to external URLs with query parameters containing system info.",
  "flows": "System info variables (hostname, username, current_path, base64 MAC addresses, rd_num) are included as URL parameters and transmitted to multiple external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of hardcoded external URLs (potential C2 servers), encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, and multiple URL requests to domains that are suspicious or potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system identifiers, encodes the MAC addresses, and transmits this information to three different external domains. The URLs use subdomains and domains that appear suspicious and are likely involved in data collection or malicious activity. The information flow involves collecting host-specific data, encoding it, and sending it via GET requests, which could be used for tracking or identifying infected hosts. The use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses is a form of obfuscation, possibly to evade simple detection. No malicious payloads or destructive commands are present; however, the communication with suspicious domains indicates potential malicious intent or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any harmful actions on the system directly, but the data transmission aspect is concerning from a privacy and security standpoint.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to collect and transmit system identifiers to external servers, which are suspicious and could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or command and control activities. While it does not execute destructive actions, its data exfiltration behavior and communication with suspicious URLs warrant caution. This activity could be part of a malicious or undesirable supply chain operation.",
