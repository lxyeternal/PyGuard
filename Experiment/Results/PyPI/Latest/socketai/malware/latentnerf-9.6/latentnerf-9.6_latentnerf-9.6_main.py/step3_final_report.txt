  "purpose": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple suspicious URLs for potential exfiltration or tracking.",
  "sources": [
    "platform.system() and platform.node() for system info",
    "getpass.getuser() for username",

  "anomalies": [

    "Encoding MAC addresses with base64 as a mild obfuscation",
    "Silent exception handling during network requests",
    "Execution of system commands to retrieve MAC addresses"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs covert collection of system identifiers and network information, encoding the MAC addresses with base64, and sends this data to multiple suspicious domains without user consent. The use of system commands to retrieve MAC addresses and silent exception handling indicates stealthy behavior. The external URLs are suspicious and likely malicious or used for tracking. The code does not execute destructive payloads but engages in data exfiltration, which is malicious in intent. The minimal obfuscation via base64 is not sophisticated but serves to hide the data slightly. The overall activity poses a high security risk due to privacy invasion and potential malicious tracking or exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data collection and exfiltration behavior to suspicious domains, with minimal obfuscation and stealthy network requests. While it does not contain destructive payloads, its intent to silently gather and transmit system information classifies it as malicious activity with high security implications.",
