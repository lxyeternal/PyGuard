  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which reads system network interfaces), and random.randint() for generating a number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with encoded parameters containing sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses, random number) is assembled into URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated encoding (base64) of MAC addresses; multiple external URLs with suspicious domains; sending potentially sensitive system info without user consent; no explicit validation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system-specific information, including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are collected through platform-dependent commands and then encoded in base64. A random number is generated for use in URL parameters. The data is then transmitted to several suspicious-looking domains via HTTP GET requests, potentially leaking system identifiers to external servers. The code appears designed to silently exfiltrate data, which is suspicious. The use of multiple external URLs with non-standard domains and the encoding suggests an attempt to evade simple detection. No user prompts or safeguards are present, and the data transmission could be malicious if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform system information collection and exfiltration to external domains, which may be malicious or used for tracking. The obfuscated encoding of MAC addresses and silent data transmission are suspicious behaviors indicating potential malicious intent.",
