  "purpose": "A minimal Python package setup script using setuptools with static name and version.",
  "sources": "Import of setuptools module; static strings for 'name' and 'version' in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration without external input or output.",
  "flows": "Import of setuptools -> call to setuptools.setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic input, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with hardcoded package name and version. No dynamic inputs, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code is a standard, benign package configuration script. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
