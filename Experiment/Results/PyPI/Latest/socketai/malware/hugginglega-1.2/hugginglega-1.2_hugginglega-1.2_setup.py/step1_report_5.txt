  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'hugginglega' Python module.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code uses static values in setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; the code does not handle user input or external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only specifies package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with predefined static strings for name and version. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a minimal and standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal Python packaging configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely specifies package metadata.",
