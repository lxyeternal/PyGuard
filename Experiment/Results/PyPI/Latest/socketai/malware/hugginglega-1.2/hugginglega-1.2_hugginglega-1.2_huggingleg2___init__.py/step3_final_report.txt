{
  "purpose": "Detects malicious remote code execution triggered upon importing 'torchvision' by fetching and executing remote script from a hardcoded IP address.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'torchvision'; subprocess.run executing 'curl ... | sh' command fetching remote code.",
  "sinks": "Shell execution via subprocess.run; remote script fetched and executed without validation.",
  "flows": "Successful import of 'torchvision' (source) leads to subprocess running remote code (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Remote code fetched from hardcoded IP and executed directly; print statement about 'transformers' is unrelated residual.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'torchvision'; if successful, it executes a shell command that downloads and runs code from an external IP, with no validation. Multiple reports correctly identify this pattern as malicious, noting the remote code fetch and execution, suspicious IP, and lack of validation. Scores assigned (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9-0.95) are justified given the severity of remote code execution. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. All reports are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high-confidence malicious pattern involving remote code execution triggered by a conditional import. The scores are appropriate; the malware score should be set to 1.0 for maximum accuracy, reflecting the clear remote code execution vector. Overall, the code represents a severe supply chain security threat, and the assessments are aligned with this behavior.",
