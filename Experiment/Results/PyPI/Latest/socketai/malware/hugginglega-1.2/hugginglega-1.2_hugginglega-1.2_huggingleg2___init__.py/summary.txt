  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high-confidence malicious pattern involving remote code execution triggered by a conditional import. The scores are appropriate; the malware score should be set to 1.0 for maximum accuracy, reflecting the clear remote code execution vector. Overall, the code represents a severe supply chain security threat, and the assessments are aligned with this behavior."
