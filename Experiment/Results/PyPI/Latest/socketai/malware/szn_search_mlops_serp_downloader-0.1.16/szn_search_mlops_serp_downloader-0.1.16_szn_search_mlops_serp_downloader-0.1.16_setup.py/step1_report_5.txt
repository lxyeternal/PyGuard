  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'szn-search-mlops-serp-downloader', including metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads static package metadata (name, version, description, author, email, URL) and package discovery via find_packages(). No untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations; no file writes, network connections, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script merely specifies package metadata and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration without obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and entry points, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The code appears to be a typical setup.py configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
