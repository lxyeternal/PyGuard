  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'szn-search-mlops-serp-downloader' to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, description, author info, URL) and package discovery via find_packages(). Reads entry point definition for command-line script.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools to install the package and define entry points; no untrusted data processing or network operations directly present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; package metadata and entry point are static, controlled inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or hidden backdoors detected. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging, importing setuptools and configuring package metadata, entry points, and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The package name and version are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. All inputs are static strings, and the structure is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and entry points for installation purposes.",
