{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'szn-search-mlops-serp-downloader', specifying its metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in this setup script; it primarily uses static strings and function calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not perform data output, network connections, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the script only prepares package metadata and entry points.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a setup.py file, with no unusual language features, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, uses find_packages() to include all packages, and specifies package metadata and an entry point for a console script. There are no input handling, no data manipulation, nor any code execution beyond package setup. The setup process is typical for Python packages and does not include any malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended for package distribution and does not perform any harmful actions.",
