  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk pattern of executing obfuscated, dynamically decoded code that can perform malicious actions. The use of exec() on such payloads, combined with network requests and module imports, indicates a significant security threat. The scores and analysis are consistent with this assessment, and caution is advised."
