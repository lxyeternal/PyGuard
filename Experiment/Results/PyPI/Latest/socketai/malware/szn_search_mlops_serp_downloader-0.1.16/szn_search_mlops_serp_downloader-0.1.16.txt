      "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The minimal security risk score is justified by the potential for the entry point to execute external code, but no evidence indicates malicious intent within this script. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and the scores are appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code contains a high-risk pattern of executing obfuscated, dynamically decoded code that can perform malicious actions. The use of exec() on such payloads, combined with network requests and module imports, indicates a significant security threat. The scores and analysis are consistent with this assessment, and caution is advised."
