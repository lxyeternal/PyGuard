  "purpose": "To execute remote code upon successful import of 'torchvision', potentially leading to malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'torchvision'; subprocess.run executing curl piped into bash.",
  "sinks": "Remote script fetched via curl and executed in bash shell, leading to potential remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Import 'torchvision' -> successful import triggers subprocess.run -> curl command fetches remote script -> script piped into bash for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Remote code fetched and executed without validation; use of 'shell=True' with piping commands; suspicious URL hosting remote script.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally executes a remote script based on the presence of 'torchvision'. It uses subprocess.run with 'shell=True' to run a curl command that pipes a remote script directly into bash, which is a common pattern for malicious payload delivery. The URL appears suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent. The pattern indicates high risk of remote code execution and backdoor installation. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but dangerous. The remote script execution without validation is a critical security vulnerability. The conditional import may serve as a trigger or obfuscation tactic. The overall behavior aligns with malicious activity, warranting maximum malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior by executing remote code without validation, conditioned on the import of 'torchvision'. It should be classified as a critical security vulnerability with maximum malware and risk scores due to its remote code execution pattern.",
