  "purpose": "Conditionally execute a remote script if the 'torchvision' module is available.",
  "sources": "Importing 'torchvision' module, executing subprocess command with a curl command piped to bash",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executing shell command that downloads and executes remote script",
  "flows": "Import check -> conditional remote script execution if module present",
  "anomalies": "Execution of remote code via curl piped to bash without validation, hardcoded URL, reliance on importlib for module detection",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'torchvision' and, if successful, executes a shell command that fetches a script from a suspicious URL and executes it with bash. This pattern indicates potential malicious intent, as remote code execution without validation is a common attack vector. The use of 'shell=True' with curl piped directly to bash is risky, enabling remote code execution. The URL appears suspicious and likely malicious. The import check seems to serve as a trigger for this malicious activity. The code contains no other security controls or validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its pattern of fetching and executing remote scripts without validation. It likely constitutes malicious behavior intended to run remote code on the host system.",
