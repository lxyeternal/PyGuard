{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'alrsnlaseast' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it imports 'setup' from distutils.core, a standard library module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining package metadata to calling setup() with fixed parameters; no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard packaging practices with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard setup function from distutils.core and invokes it with fixed, hardcoded package metadata. No dynamic or malicious behavior is evident. It does not perform any network operations, data manipulation, or environment inspection. The use of distutils for setup is common and benign. The code is minimal and straightforward, adhering to typical packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or suspicious logic.",
