  "purpose": "Simple script to print 'hello world'",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations",
  "sinks": "No output to external systems or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the if statement: '=' instead of '==' in 'if __name__ = \"__main__\"'",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic Python script intended to print 'hello world'. It contains a syntax error in the conditional statement: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\"' should use '==' for comparison. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. The only issue is the syntax error which would prevent execution, but it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple, benign program with a syntax mistake. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The primary concern is a syntax error, not security.",
