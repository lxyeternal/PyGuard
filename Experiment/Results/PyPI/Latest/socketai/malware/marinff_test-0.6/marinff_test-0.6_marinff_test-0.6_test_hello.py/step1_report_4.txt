  "purpose": "Simple function to print 'hello world' when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output via print function.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the if statement: should be '==' instead of '='; no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function hello() that prints a greeting. The conditional check intended to execute hello() when run as a script contains a syntax error ('=' instead of '=='), which would cause a runtime error and prevent execution. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no external dependencies, no data leakage, and no code injection or backdoors present. The code is trivial and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign script with a syntax error that prevents execution. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
