  "purpose": "Simple script to print 'hello world' to the console",
  "sources": "No external input sources; no input reading functions",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output (print statement)",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the if statement: '=' used instead of '=='",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'hello' that prints a greeting. The main execution block contains a syntax error: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' should be 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":'. This typo prevents the script from executing as intended. No malicious or suspicious code is present; the only issue is a syntax mistake that would cause a runtime error. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, intended to print 'hello world', but contains a syntax error that would prevent execution. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
