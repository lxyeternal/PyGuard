{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple function to print 'hello world' and executes it if the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; only prints to standard output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the if statement ('=' instead of '==') which causes a syntax error and prevents execution.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to define a function that prints 'hello world' and execute it if the script is run as main. However, the conditional statement has a syntax error ('if __name__ = \"__main__\":') that would prevent the code from running. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks present in this simple script. The only issue is a syntax mistake that would cause the script to fail when executed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward example with a syntax error. It does not contain any malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The primary concern is the typo in the conditional statement, which is a functional bug, not a security issue.",
