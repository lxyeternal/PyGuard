{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell to a specified IP and port.",
  "sources": "The custom install class that executes code during the install process; the base64-encoded shell command executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing a base64-decoded reverse shell command that connects to an external IP and port.",
  "flows": "During installation, the CustomInstall.run() method encodes a reverse shell command in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, establishing a network connection to the specified IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hard-coded IP address and port for the reverse shell. It dynamically constructs and executes a reverse shell command during installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the setup process by subclassing the install command to include malicious code. It constructs a reverse shell command targeting 192.168.239.158:1234, encodes it in base64, and executes it immediately after installation begins. This behavior indicates intent to establish remote control of the system upon package installation. The use of base64 encoding and direct execution through os.system suggests an attempt to obfuscate the malicious activity, but the core purpose remains to open a reverse shell connection. The package metadata and modules do not appear suspicious, but the malicious code within the custom install class constitutes a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, embedding a reverse shell payload that executes during installation. It hard-codes network parameters and obfuscates the command, indicating malicious intent to enable remote access or control of the target system upon package installation.",
