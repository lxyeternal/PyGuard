{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command constructed with LHOST and LPORT, executed via os.system after decoding from base64.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing the decoded reverse shell command, which connects to an external IP and opens a shell.",
  "flows": "The setup process triggers the CustomInstall.run method, which builds the reverse shell command, encodes it, decodes it via base64, and executes it with os.system, establishing a network connection.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of a hardcoded IP address and port for reverse shell, use of base64 encoding and decoding, execution of shell command during installation, and lack of any user prompt or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom installation class. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port, encodes this command in base64, and then executes it by decoding and piping into bash via os.system. This behavior is embedded within the setup process, meaning any installation of this package will automatically establish an outbound connection to the attacker's machine. The hardcoded IP and port, along with the base64 encoding, are typical signs of obfuscation intended to bypass simple detection. This pattern strongly indicates malicious intent, as it enables remote control without user awareness or consent. No other suspicious library usage or obfuscated code beyond base64 encoding is present, but the purpose and method are clearly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes embedded malicious code designed to create a reverse shell connection upon installation, representing a high security threat. It appears to be intentionally malicious, with hardcoded connection details and automatic execution during setup.",
