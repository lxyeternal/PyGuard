{
  "purpose": "The code executes a reverse shell during installation by constructing a command with hardcoded IP and port, encoding it in base64, decoding, and executing it, thereby establishing a remote connection without user consent.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it constructs the reverse shell command directly within the run() method.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded base64 string, which runs the reverse shell command, establishing an outbound connection to the specified IP and port.",
  "flows": "The code constructs the reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, leading to a remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious command; hardcoded IP and port; execution during package installation without validation or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install class that, during installation, builds a reverse shell command with fixed IP and port, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, resulting in a reverse connection. No external input influences this behavior. The obfuscation via base64 is straightforward but effective in hiding the payload. The hardcoded connection details and execution during install point to malicious intent. The code's behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns, enabling remote control of the host system. The malware score of 1.0, obfuscation around 0.8, and security risk of 1.0 are justified given the severity of the malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious reverse shell that executes during package installation, with moderate obfuscation via base64 encoding. It poses a critical security threat, enabling remote attacker control. The assigned scores are consistent with the behavior, and the package should be flagged as malicious.",
