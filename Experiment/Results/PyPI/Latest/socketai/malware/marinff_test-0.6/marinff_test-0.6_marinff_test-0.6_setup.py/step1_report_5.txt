{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, executes a reverse shell to a specified IP and port, potentially for malicious remote access.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command constructed with hardcoded IP and port, executed via os.system after base64 decoding.",
  "sinks": "os.system call that executes a decoded base64 command which initiates a reverse shell connection to an external server.",
  "flows": "The setup script runs the CustomInstall class, which constructs a base64-encoded reverse shell command and executes it through os.system, establishing a network connection to the attacker's machine.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP address and port; reverse shell payload executed immediately upon package installation without user consent; use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the command; execution via os.system which is insecure and facilitates remote code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script for a Python package. It defines a CustomInstall class that overrides the run method to execute additional code during installation. Inside run(), it constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP and port, then encodes it in base64. The encoded command is decoded and executed via os.system, establishing a reverse shell connection to the attacker-controlled server. This behavior is highly suspicious as it introduces a malicious backdoor that activates upon package installation, with obfuscation to evade detection. The use of os.system with decoded base64 payloads is a common tactic to hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to create a reverse shell backdoor during package installation. The hardcoded IP, immediate execution, and obfuscated command strongly indicate malicious intent. This package should not be used and should be considered a security threat.",
