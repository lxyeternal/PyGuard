{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to install a Python module and execute a reverse shell payload during installation.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command is constructed within the CustomInstall class's run method and is executed via os.system after base64 decoding.",
  "sinks": "The decoded base64 payload is piped directly into bash, executing a reverse shell connection to an external IP and port.",
  "flows": "The code generates a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it at runtime, and executes it via os.system, establishing a remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual embedding of a reverse shell command within the setup script; dynamic execution of base64-decoded code; hardcoded IP and port; no user prompts or validation.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools installation process by overriding the run method. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command targeting IP 192.168.239.158 on port 1234, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via a system call. This behavior occurs automatically during installation, indicating malicious intent. The hardcoded IP, port, and reverse shell payload are typical signs of malicious backdoor behavior. The code bypasses user consent and performs network activity upon package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains embedded malicious behavior that initiates a reverse shell connection during package installation, representing a security risk and malicious backdoor. The package is designed to compromise the system where it is installed, indicating high malicious intent.",
