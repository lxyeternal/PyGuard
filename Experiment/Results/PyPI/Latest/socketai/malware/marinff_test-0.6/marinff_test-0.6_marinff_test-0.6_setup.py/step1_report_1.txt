{
  "purpose": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package and includes a custom installation step that executes a reverse shell command upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it uses hardcoded IP address and port within the CustomInstall class. The reverse shell command is constructed from hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded shell command, which opens a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port, potentially allowing remote control.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system, creating a source-to-sink flow that results in remote code execution upon package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP address and port; the reverse shell code is embedded directly into the setup script and executed during installation, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the command is also notable.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script but contains a malicious custom installation step that runs a reverse shell connecting back to a specified IP address and port. This reverse shell is constructed as a Python command string, encoded in base64, then decoded and executed via os.system during package installation. The hardcoded IP and port suggest an attacker-controlled host. The obfuscation via base64 indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The code does not perform any other security checks or validation, and the malicious behavior is directly triggered during installation, making this a supply chain attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior in its custom install step, executing a reverse shell to a remote server during installation. The code is intentionally obfuscated and designed to establish unauthorized remote access, representing a significant security risk.",
