  "conclusion": "The setup script executes external code ('main()') during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk. This pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The reports' assessments are accurate; the malware score could be slightly increased to better reflect the high risk, with a recommended malware score around 0.7 and a security risk score of approximately 0.75. This pattern warrants caution and thorough review of 'main.py' before trusting or deploying the package."
