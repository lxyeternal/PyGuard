{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tarsie' package, including custom installation behavior that executes a function upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports and executes the 'main' function from 'main' module during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' from 'main' module, which may contain arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method calls 'install.run(self)' and then executes 'main()' from the 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior: executing a function from an external module ('main') during install process. The code does not verify or sandbox 'main()', which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after performing the standard installation steps, imports and executes 'main()' from a local module 'main'. This behavior triggers code execution at install time, which is suspicious, especially since the content of 'main' is unknown. The script does not include any validation or restrictions on 'main', posing a risk if 'main' contains malicious code. No other suspicious or malicious patterns are present, but the execution of arbitrary code during install is a significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. This behavior is suspicious and warrants caution, especially if the package source or 'main' content is untrusted. No other malicious indicators are present, but the execution pattern is potentially dangerous.",
