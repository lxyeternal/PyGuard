  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with a custom install command that executes code from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports and executes the 'main' function from the 'main' module during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' after install, potential if 'main' contains malicious code or performs harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Setup script runs 'install', which then runs 'main()' from main.py during the post-install phase.",
  "anomalies": "Custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes 'main()' unconditionally after installation, which is unusual and potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a standard setup configuration with a custom install class that overrides 'run' method. After the default installation process, it imports and calls 'main()' from 'main'. This behavior is atypical for package setup scripts, as executing arbitrary code during installation can be exploited for malicious purposes. The code does not perform any apparent validation or safeguards before executing 'main()', which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. The use of 'requests' as an install requirement is standard and not suspicious. Overall, the critical concern is the unconditional execution of external code ('main()') during package installation, which may introduce malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious behavior by executing 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation without validation. This could be exploited to run malicious code on the target system during package installation.",
