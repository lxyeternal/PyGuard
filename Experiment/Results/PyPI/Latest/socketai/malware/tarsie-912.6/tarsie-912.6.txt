      "conclusion": "The setup script executes external code ('main()') during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk. This pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The reports' assessments are accurate; the malware score could be slightly increased to better reflect the high risk, with a recommended malware score around 0.7 and a security risk score of approximately 0.75. This pattern warrants caution and thorough review of 'main.py' before trusting or deploying the package."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. While no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, the behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious. The malware score should be increased to reflect this activity, and the overall security risk is high due to untrusted external communication."
