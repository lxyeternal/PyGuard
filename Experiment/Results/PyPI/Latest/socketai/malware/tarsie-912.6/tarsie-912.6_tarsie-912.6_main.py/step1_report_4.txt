  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) and a random number are sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system identifiers and current directory to suspicious domains without user consent, using hardcoded URLs that appear malicious. Use of random number for request uniqueness is suspicious. No user prompts or disclosures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or suspicious domains and sends this data via GET requests. The use of multiple URLs with obscure domains suggests potential tracking or data exfiltration. No input validation or user notification is present. The code does not perform any other malicious actions but facilitates untrusted data transmission. No obfuscation or encrypted communication is used; the code is straightforward and clear, but the behavior is suspicious given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to collect and exfiltrate system information to external servers without user awareness, indicating malicious intent or at least malicious potential. The URLs point to suspicious domains, and the data transmission is unencrypted and automated. Overall, this code has high malicious behavior risk.",
