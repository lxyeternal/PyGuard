  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) from sources -> URL construction -> HTTP GET request via urllib to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "Multiple external URLs receiving system information, use of hardcoded URLs that appear suspicious, no clear user consent or purpose explained",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters. It attempts to send HTTP GET requests to three external domains, which are potentially malicious or used for tracking. The URLs are obscure and resemble command-and-control or data exfiltration domains. There is no user input validation or encryption; data is sent unencrypted. No malicious code execution or credential theft observed, but the behavior suggests data collection and potential exfiltration without user knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and transmits it to suspicious external domains without explicit user consent, indicating potential malicious behavior or tracking activity. The code itself is straightforward but designed for covert data transmission.",
