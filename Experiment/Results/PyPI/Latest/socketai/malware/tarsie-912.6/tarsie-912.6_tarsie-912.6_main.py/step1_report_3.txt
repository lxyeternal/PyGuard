  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs for monitoring or tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Constructed URLs with query parameters are used to send data via urllib.request.urlopen to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info and a random number are gathered as sources, then encoded into URL parameters, and sent to remote URLs (sinks) over HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "The code repeatedly contacts multiple external servers with system info and a random number, which is unusual and may indicate tracking or data exfiltration. No explicit malicious code or backdoors are present, but the purpose of these network calls is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to third-party domains, appending collected data as URL parameters, then makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs. The repeated outbound connections to suspicious domains and the transmission of system info without clear purpose raise security concerns. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or harmful code execution. The use of try-except blocks for network requests is standard, but the purpose of data collection to unknown domains is potentially privacy-invasive. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign-looking data collection and transmission, but the external domains and data being sent suggest potential tracking or privacy violation. The behavior warrants caution but does not definitively indicate malware. Overall risk is moderate, primarily due to external communication and data transmission to suspicious domains.",
