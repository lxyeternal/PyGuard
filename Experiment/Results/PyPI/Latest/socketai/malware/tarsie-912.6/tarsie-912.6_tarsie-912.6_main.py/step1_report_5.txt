  "anomalies": "Sending system info to suspicious domains; use of random number in URL; no user consent or obvious purpose; no validation or sanitization of data",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and appends these parameters as GET query parameters. The script attempts to fetch URLs and logs responses or errors. The use of multiple external URLs with questionable domains suggests potential data exfiltration or tracking activities. The code does not appear to perform any functional or benign purpose; rather, it seems to silently send system info to external servers, which is suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by sending system information to untrusted, potentially malicious domains without user consent. It appears to be designed for tracking or data collection, which could be malicious.",
