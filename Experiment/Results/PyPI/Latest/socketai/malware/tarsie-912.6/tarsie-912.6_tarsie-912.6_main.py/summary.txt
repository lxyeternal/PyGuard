  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. While no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, the behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious. The malware score should be increased to reflect this activity, and the overall security risk is high due to untrusted external communication."
