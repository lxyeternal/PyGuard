  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through repeated external network requests to a potentially malicious server during import and installation. While no direct payloads or destructive actions are present, the network activity alone is indicative of malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The scores should reflect high suspicion, with malware at 0.75 and security risk at 0.75, consistent with the behavior observed."
