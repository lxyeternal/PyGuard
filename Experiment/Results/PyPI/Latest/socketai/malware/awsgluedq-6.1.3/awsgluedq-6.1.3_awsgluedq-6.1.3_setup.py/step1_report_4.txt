  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom post-installation hook that makes an HTTP request.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver' made during module import and in post-install method.",
  "sinks": "Network request to an external server with potentially untrusted endpoint.",
  "flows": "Import statement triggers immediate HTTP GET request; post_install function also performs the same request after installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual: Making an external HTTP request at import time, which could be used for tracking or malicious data collection. The endpoint is a suspicious domain and port, indicating potential command-and-control or data exfiltration. No use of environment variables or dynamic code execution; the request is hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a potentially malicious or untrusted domain ('pov.sh') both during import and after installation. The request is made twice, which is unusual for a standard package setup. The domain and port (45111) are suspicious, often associated with malicious activities or command-and-control servers. There is no clear purpose for these requests within a normal package installation, indicating potential privacy invasion or malicious control. No obfuscation or code hiding techniques are present. The code’s primary function appears to be making network requests that could leak system or user data to an external entity.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains suspicious network activity that could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or tracking. Making external requests during import and post-installation is unusual and potentially malicious. The code's behavior warrants security caution before use.",
