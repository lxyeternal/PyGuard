{
  "purpose": "Package setup script for a Python package that performs an HTTP GET request during installation.",
  "sources": "The request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver' in the global scope and within the post_install() function called during installation.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP request potentially sends data or signals to the specified server; no other data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "The script makes an HTTP GET request upon import and again during post-installation, establishing a connection to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated network request to a suspicious domain/IP during import and install process; no clear benign purpose; no user interaction or explicit data collection shown; the request is made twice, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures using setuptools, with an added custom install command that executes a network request to a specific external server during both import time and installation. The network request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver' occurs without any conditional logic or user input, which is suspicious. The purpose of this request is unclear; it could be for version checking, or it could be malicious, such as triggering remote code, signaling, or data exfiltration. The rest of the setup code appears typical and benign. The repeated request during installation suggests potential malicious intent or surveillance behavior, especially if the external server is controlled by an attacker or unknown entity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by making an external network call during both import and installation phases, which could be used for tracking, verifying the presence of the package, or malicious purposes. No other malicious activities or obfuscation are evident. The code should be reviewed further before use, and the external request should be scrutinized or blocked.",
