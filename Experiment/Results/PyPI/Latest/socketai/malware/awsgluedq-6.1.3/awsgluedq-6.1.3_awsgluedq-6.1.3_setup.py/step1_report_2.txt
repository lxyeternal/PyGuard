{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup script with a custom install command that performs a network request during installation.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver' during the module import and in the post-install hook.",
  "sinks": "Network request to external server; potential data transmission or server communication during package installation.",
  "flows": "Import sys/os triggers the request, then during installation, the custom command executes the request again.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated external network requests during import and installation, which is unusual and suspicious. No apparent necessity for these requests related to package functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and makes an immediate HTTP GET request to an external server ('http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver') at import time. It also defines a post-install hook that makes the same request after package installation via a custom setup command. This behavior could be used to track installations or exfiltrate data, especially since the URL appears suspicious. No user input or environment variables are used, and the requests library is standard. The code does not appear to perform malicious actions beyond the potential privacy intrusion of making network requests during setup, which could be exploited for malicious tracking or command-and-control purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs external network requests during import and installation, which is suspicious and could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not include direct malicious payloads but exhibits behaviors that are often associated with malicious or privacy-invasive packages.",
