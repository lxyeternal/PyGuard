{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom install command that performs an HTTP GET request to a specific URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver' fetched twice within the script, once at the module level and once in the post_install() function.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() calls send data to an external server, potentially leaking installation information or system details to the specified domain.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom PostInstallCommand triggers post_install(), which performs an external HTTP request to pov.sh:45111.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unnecessary external request twice; the URL used appears suspicious or unusual, and there is no documentation or clear purpose for this request. The request URL suggests possible data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with standard metadata but includes a hidden behavior: it makes an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('pov.sh:45111') both immediately upon module load and again during post-installation. This behavior could be used to exfiltrate information about the environment where the package is installed or to signal to an external server. The repeated requests and the specific URL are suspicious, as they may indicate malicious intent such as unauthorized data collection or command and control communication. No other malicious code, such as data theft, system modification, or backdoors, is evident. The code's structure and use of standard libraries suggest it is designed to look innocuous but performs hidden network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes suspicious network activity that may serve malicious purposes, such as data exfiltration or remote control. The repeated external requests to an obscure server raise concern for potential malicious behavior or privacy violations. Overall, the package exhibits behaviors that should be reviewed and likely prevented from distribution without further investigation.",
