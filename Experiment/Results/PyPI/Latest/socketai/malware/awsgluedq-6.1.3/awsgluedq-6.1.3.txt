      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through repeated external network requests to a potentially malicious server during import and installation. While no direct payloads or destructive actions are present, the network activity alone is indicative of malicious or privacy-invasive intent. The scores should reflect high suspicion, with malware at 0.75 and security risk at 0.75, consistent with the behavior observed."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious external network activity to an obscure URL, indicating potential malicious intent. While no payload or obfuscation is present, the external contact warrants caution. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and justified, with a moderate to high security concern due to the suspicious URL and lack of context."
