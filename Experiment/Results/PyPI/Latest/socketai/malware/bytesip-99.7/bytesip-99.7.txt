      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the execution of external code ('main()') during package installation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes. While the code itself is straightforward, this pattern is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The scores in the reports are appropriate; however, a higher malware score (~0.8) and risk score (~0.8) are justified given the potential for malicious code execution. No obfuscation is detected. It is recommended to review or avoid executing external code during setup unless absolutely necessary and verified."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious data exfiltration behavior to external domains, consistent with malicious or tracking activity. The high malware and security risk scores are justified given the covert nature of the data transmission. The code should be flagged for further review or removal due to privacy and security concerns."
