  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current path) -> URL encoding -> HTTP GET request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Sending system info to external servers without any user consent, hardcoded URLs, use of random numbers for URL parameters, no validation or encryption, potential tracking behavior",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to three external domains. The URLs are suspicious due to their domain names and the purpose of collecting system info. There is no validation or encryption, and it could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The use of try-except for network errors indicates an attempt to run silently. Overall, the code performs unsolicited data collection and transmission, which could be malicious or invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to external servers, potentially for malicious or tracking purposes. It shows no user interaction or consent, and the external URLs are suspicious. The behavior warrants security caution.",
