{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple remote URLs as part of a reporting or tracking mechanism.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, username, and current working directory; generates a random number; constructs URLs with these parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses urllib.request.urlopen to send HTTP GET requests to external servers, transmitting system information.",
  "flows": "System info is collected as sources, then embedded in URLs, which are requested via HTTP, sending data to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious, pointing to potentially malicious or tracking domains (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun). The code exfiltrates system info without user consent. The use of random numbers in URL paths and multiple remote connections for data transmission is unusual and indicative of potential data exfiltration or tracking behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters along with a randomly generated number. It attempts to open each URL, which results in sending this information to external servers. The domains used are associated with oast (a common tool for testing and security assessments), but their presence in this context suggests potential malicious intent, especially if used without user consent. The code does not include any explicit user interaction or logs sensitive data locally; it silently transmits data. The activity pattern aligns with information exfiltration or tracking behavior commonly associated with malicious scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script exfiltrates system information to suspicious external servers without user knowledge or consent, indicating malicious behavior related to data theft or tracking. The use of oast domains suggests testing or reconnaissance activity, possibly malicious in intent. The code is not obfuscated but does perform unusual data transmission activities, raising security concerns.",
