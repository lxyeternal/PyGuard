  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs with a random identifier.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url)",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are embedded as URL parameters in requests sent to remote URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs to send system data; no validation or authentication; the URLs are suspicious and could be malicious endpoints. The code gathers environment details and transmits them without user consent or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current working directory, and a randomly generated number. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and attempts to access them, logging the responses or errors. The URLs are unusual and appear to be designed for data exfiltration. The use of hardcoded URLs and transmission of environment data indicate potentially malicious intent, such as system reconnaissance or data leakage. No input validation or encryption is present, and the code does not perform any legitimate or benign functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates system information to suspicious external domains without user consent, indicating malicious behavior. It is likely part of a malware or backdoor component designed to gather and send environment details to attacker-controlled servers.",
