  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) - sending data to external domains",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into URL parameters, which are then sent over HTTP to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code gathers system info and sends it to suspicious domains, with no clear legitimate purpose. The URLs appear malicious or suspicious, and the use of dynamic URL generation with random numbers and system info hints at potential tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number, then constructs URLs with these parameters. It attempts to connect to these URLs and logs responses or errors. The target URLs are suspicious, possibly malicious, and the data transmission pattern resembles data exfiltration or tracking. No authentication or encryption is used, and the code does not appear to perform any legitimate, benign function. The use of multiple suspicious domains, including non-standard TLDs like '.fun' and encoded paths, adds to suspicion. The code may be part of a malicious supply chain or malware campaign attempting to gather system info and report it to command-and-control servers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is likely malicious or used for malicious purposes, such as system info exfiltration or tracking. It contacts suspicious external servers with system details, which could compromise user privacy and security.",
