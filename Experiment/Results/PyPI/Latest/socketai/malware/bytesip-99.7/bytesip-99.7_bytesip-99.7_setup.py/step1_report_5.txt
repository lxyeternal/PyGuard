  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with a custom installation step that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the CrazyInstallStrat class, which imports and executes main() from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() from main.py, which could contain arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom 'run' method is invoked, importing main and executing main().",
  "anomalies": "The code executes an external script (main.py) as part of the installation process, which is unusual and potentially malicious if main() contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The setup script extends the standard install command with CrazyInstallStrat. This class overrides the run method, which first calls the original run method, then imports and executes main() from main.py. This behavior means that whenever the package is installed, the main() function runs automatically. Such automatic execution during install can be used maliciously to run arbitrary code, especially if main.py contains malicious logic. The rest of the setup code appears normal, specifying package metadata and dependencies. The key concern is the execution of main() during installation, which could lead to malicious activity if main.py is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a custom install step that automatically executes main() from main.py during installation. This behavior can be exploited for malicious purposes by executing arbitrary code, making this a potential supply chain security risk. The code itself is not obfuscated but contains a suspicious automatic code execution pattern.",
