  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by fetching and executing remote code during installation, with obfuscation and silent failure concealment. The pattern aligns with supply chain attack tactics, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.9) are justified and consistent with this analysis."
