{
  "purpose": "To define a setup script for the 'seabonr' package, including a custom post-install command that executes potentially suspicious shell commands.",
  "sources": "The lambda functions constructing strings (get_url, b, c, v, t), and the subprocess.run calls executing constructed commands.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess commands executing shell commands, including network or system commands, with dynamically constructed strings.",
  "flows": "Lambda functions generate command strings, which are then executed by subprocess.run, potentially running network or system commands with dynamically generated inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions to dynamically construct strings (possibly obfuscation), execution of shell commands with shell=True, and the use of subprocess to run network-related commands without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during installation, attempts to execute shell commands constructed from obfuscated string literals. The get_url lambda constructs a URL pointing to a raw GitHub page, which might be used for retrieving external resources. The subprocess calls execute commands like 'bash -s -L <url> | bash -s <t>', which may be malicious if they download or execute code from external sources. The use of shell=True and output suppression further conceal potential malicious activity. The obfuscated string construction via chr() sequences indicates an attempt to evade detection or analysis. Overall, the code executes external commands that could be used to download, run, or fetch data from remote sources, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes obfuscated code that executes external commands during installation, likely for malicious or unauthorized purposes. The use of dynamic string construction, shell=True subprocess calls, and network-related commands indicates high risk. This code should be considered malicious or at least suspicious, and its inclusion in a package poses significant security concerns.",
