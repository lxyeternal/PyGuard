  "purpose": "Custom post-installation script that executes shell commands involving network access and external URL retrieval.",
  "sources": "Lambda functions generating strings (hardcoded URL and commands), subprocess.run calls executing shell commands with dynamic URL and command strings.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run with shell=True executing commands that involve network access and potentially untrusted URL.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded URL and command strings are used in subprocess.run calls; get_url() and other lambda functions generate command components that are executed via shell.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions to obfuscate string literals, dynamic command execution via subprocess with shell=True, silent error handling suppressing exceptions, execution of potentially external commands.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a post-install command that, during package installation, runs subprocess commands involving an obfuscated URL and commands. The get_url() lambda constructs a URL from character codes, which appears to point to an external server. The script then runs shell commands with subprocess.run, including network-related commands that download or execute scripts from the URL, potentially acting as a backdoor or malicious payload. The use of shell=True with dynamic string generation raises concerns about command injection or malicious remote code execution. Error handling is broad and suppresses exceptions, which could hide malicious activity. Overall, the code performs network operations during installation, fetching remote code or data, which is suspicious in a package context.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior potential by executing dynamically constructed shell commands that contact an external URL during installation. The obfuscation techniques and silent error handling suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Given these factors, the code should be considered potentially malicious with a high security risk.",
