{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to execute remote commands during package installation, likely to fetch and run malicious payloads from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The URL constructed via get_url() and the command strings generated by lambda functions (b, c, v, t).",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() calls executing shell commands that fetch remote content and potentially execute it, especially the command involving 'curl' and piping into other commands.",
  "flows": "The get_url() function provides the remote URL; this URL is used in subprocess commands that fetch and execute remote code, with string commands obfuscated via chr() sequences.",
  "anomalies": "Use of chr() decoding for strings, dynamic URL construction, execution of shell commands with shell=True, silent exception handling, and remote code fetch during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a remote URL through ASCII decoding, then executes shell commands that involve fetching remote content and piping it into other commands, all obfuscated via chr() sequences. The use of shell=True and silent error handling conceals failures. This pattern is characteristic of malicious code aiming to download and execute remote payloads during package installation, representing a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by fetching and executing remote code during installation, with obfuscation and silent failure concealment. The pattern aligns with supply chain attack tactics, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, obfuscated ~0.8, security risk ~0.9) are justified and consistent with this analysis.",
