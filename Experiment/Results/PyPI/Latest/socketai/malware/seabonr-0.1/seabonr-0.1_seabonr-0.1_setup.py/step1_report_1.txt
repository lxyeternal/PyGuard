{
  "purpose": "This setup script customizes the installation process to run specific commands after installation, possibly for setup or malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Code constructs a URL string via character codes, and executes subprocess commands; the URL is embedded as a string within a lambda function.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess.run with shell=True, executing commands that include a dynamically constructed URL and potentially malicious shell commands.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a URL, then runs a command: 'curl -s -L <URL> | base64 -s <another_command>' (with obfuscated parts), which could fetch and execute remote code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated string construction via chr codes, dynamic execution of shell commands with shell=True, and silent suppression of errors. The URL points to a remote resource, and the commands involve piping and base64 operations, indicating potential payload download and execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, constructs a URL from character codes. It then runs a subprocess to fetch and possibly execute code from the remote URL, piping it through base64 decoding. The command uses shell=True, which is risky, and errors are silently suppressed. The obfuscation and remote code fetch suggest malicious intent, such as retrieving and executing remote payloads during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated code that downloads and executes remote content during installation, indicating malicious behavior with high confidence. The use of shell commands, silent error handling, and obfuscation techniques point to potential malware or supply chain attack vectors.",
