{
  "purpose": "Custom post-installation script that runs a command involving network access and possibly executing shell commands during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly but constructs URLs and commands via hardcoded lambda functions. It also runs subprocess commands which execute external processes.",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run commands that execute shell commands constructed from the code, potentially running arbitrary commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "Constructed URL and command strings are used in subprocess.run calls, executing network-related and shell commands during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses lambda functions to obfuscate string construction, dynamically constructs URLs and commands, and executes them in subprocess with shell=True. The URL points to a remote resource, and the subprocess commands may download or execute remote code, indicating suspicious obfuscation and potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during installation, constructs a URL and command strings using obfuscated lambda functions. It attempts to run a subprocess that fetches a remote resource via 'curl' and pipes it into 'bash', which is a typical pattern for malicious code execution. The use of shell=True and dynamic string construction adds obfuscation, and the remote URL could host malicious scripts. The code catches exceptions silently, avoiding error reporting. This behavior suggests an attempt to hide malicious or unwanted activity during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscated behavior designed to execute remote scripts during package installation, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. It could be used to compromise systems upon package installation by executing arbitrary remote code.",
