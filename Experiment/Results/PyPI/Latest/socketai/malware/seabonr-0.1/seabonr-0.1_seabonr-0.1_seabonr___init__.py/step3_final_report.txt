{
  "purpose": "A simple print statement outputting a static message indicating no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static code with no data flow.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only executes a print statement with static content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a print statement with a fixed string. All reports confirm the absence of external inputs, data flows, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious activity, security risks, or anomalies are present. The analysis is straightforward and accurate, with no unwarranted assumptions or errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or suspicious features. The current assessment and scores are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
