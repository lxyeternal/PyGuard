  "purpose": "Module export pattern defining __all__ with imported Constructor class",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module .constructor",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "Import of Constructor; setting __all__ to expose it",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__, a common pattern in Python packages. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code is syntactically correct, simple, and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard module boilerplate with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or near zero) are appropriate and justified.",
