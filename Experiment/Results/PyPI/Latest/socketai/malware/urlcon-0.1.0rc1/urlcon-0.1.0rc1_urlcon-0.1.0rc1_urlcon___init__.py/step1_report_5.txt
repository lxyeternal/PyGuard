  "purpose": "This code defines the public API of a module by exporting the Constructor class from a relative import.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .constructor import Constructor",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external communication are present",
  "flows": "The code imports Constructor and then exposes it in __all__, with no data flow or processing involved",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import and export operation. It imports Constructor from a relative module and sets __all__ to expose it publicly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The minimalistic structure indicates it is a typical module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module interface. No malicious intent or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
