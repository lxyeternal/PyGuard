  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is a straightforward import and export declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None identified.\n   - **Scores**: Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk score**: 0 is justified; no security risk.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correctly assessed.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; simple import/export.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Appropriate; no malware or obfuscation.\n   - **Risk score**: 0, which is justified.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Again, just import and export; no malicious activity.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues.\n   - **Scores**: Malware score is 0, matching the benign nature.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1 is slightly above zero, indicating minimal concern. Given the code's simplicity, this is perhaps a conservative estimate but still acceptable.\n   - **Conclusion**: No evidence of malicious behavior; the risk score can remain at 0.1.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as others; minimal code.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Malware is 0, consistent.\n   - **Risk score**: 0, justified.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same minimal import/export pattern.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Malware 0, appropriate.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.1, which is acceptable given the benign code.\n   - **Conclusion**: Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The small security risk scores (0.1) are conservative but acceptable, considering the minimal exposure.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score**: Should be **0** for all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score**: Correctly **0**.\n- **Risk score**: Should remain **0** for all, as the code is harmless.\n\n### Overall:\nThe assessments are consistent and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My overall estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is standard module boilerplate with no security concerns.",
