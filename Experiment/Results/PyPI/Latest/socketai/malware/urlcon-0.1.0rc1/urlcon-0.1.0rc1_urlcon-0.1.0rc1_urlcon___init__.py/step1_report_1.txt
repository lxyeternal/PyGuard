{
  "purpose": "Export the Constructor class from the current package module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement and the __all__ variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output is present in this code.",
  "flows": "The import statement may lead to the execution of external code from constructor.py; setting __all__ restricts module exports but does not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and defines __all__ for export control. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The import is from a relative module, which is standard for package internal imports. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard package boilerplate, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
