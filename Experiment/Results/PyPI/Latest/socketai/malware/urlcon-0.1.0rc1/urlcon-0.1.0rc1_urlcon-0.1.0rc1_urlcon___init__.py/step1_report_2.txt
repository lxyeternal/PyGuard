  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple import/export statement",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Constructor from a local module, then defines __all__ to include 'Constructor' for controlled exports. There are no data inputs, user inputs, or external interactions. No malicious code, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving as a module export statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
