  "purpose": "This code exports the Constructor class from a local module for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .constructor import Constructor' and the __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Import statement flows into the __all__ declaration, which exposes Constructor for external use.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, or other signs of malicious intent. The structure is standard for module exports in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as an export module for the Constructor class. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
