  "sources": "Static data defining package configuration, version, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration data only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging. It defines package data, dependencies, and metadata with static values. There are no input sources, user data, or external data reads. No sink functions or data flows that could lead to security issues. The code is a standard setup script with typical package metadata, and there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not contain any anomalies or suspicious logic.",
