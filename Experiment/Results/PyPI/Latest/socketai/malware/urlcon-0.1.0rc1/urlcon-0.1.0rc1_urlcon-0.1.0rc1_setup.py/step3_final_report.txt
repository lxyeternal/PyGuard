  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and data.",
  "sources": "Static package data, metadata fields, and sample usage in long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or user input processed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder values like 'None' for maintainer, url, and maintainer_email; no malicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with static data, no dynamic execution, external interactions, or suspicious patterns. The placeholder 'None' values are unconventional but not malicious. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minor 'securityRisk' score of 0.1 in one report is justified by incomplete metadata but does not indicate a real threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and minimal security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
