{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string and a safety token, likely for use in a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the hardcoded string assigned to __safety_token__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows leading to external systems, outputs, or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "The variable __safety_token__ contains a base64-encoded string, which suggests obfuscation or hidden data. The use of b64decode is imported as 't', but is not used within this snippet, indicating potential for future decoding or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports base64 decoding function, defines a version string, and sets a base64-encoded token. The token looks like it encodes a URL or API key, potentially for secret access. However, no decoding or malicious actions are performed within this snippet. The presence of obfuscated data suggests potential concealment of sensitive information or malicious intent in larger context, but no malicious activity is evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This code only initializes static variables with no active malicious or security-threatening behavior. The use of a base64-encoded token indicates possible obfuscation, but no malicious actions are present in this snippet. Overall, the code appears benign.",
