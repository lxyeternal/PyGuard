{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version and a safety token, likely for use in a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the hardcoded string assigned to __safety_token__.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent, stored externally, or used in any suspicious way within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code decodes the base64 string stored in __safety_token__, but this decoded data is not utilized further in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded string labeled as a 'safety token' could suggest obfuscation or hidden data. The decoded string might contain a URL or code intended for later use. No other suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports b64decode but only assigns it an alias 't', which is not used further. It sets a version string and a 'safety token' that is base64-encoded. Decoding this token reveals a URL and some code, potentially indicating an embedded URL for tracking or later network activity. The code snippet itself does not perform any malicious actions or external communications directly. Its structure suggests preparatory or obfuscated data, but with no active malicious behavior seen here.",
  "conclusion": "This code by itself does not demonstrate malicious activity or malware. The encoded string might be used elsewhere in the larger project, potentially for network requests or configuration. Without further context, it is not possible to definitively label it malicious, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
