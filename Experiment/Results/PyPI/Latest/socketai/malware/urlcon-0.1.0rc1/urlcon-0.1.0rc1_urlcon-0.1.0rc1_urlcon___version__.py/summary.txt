  "conclusion": "The code itself is not actively malicious but contains obfuscated data and external URLs that could be exploited in a broader context. The current scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments to reflect the potential risk posed by the encoded content. Continuous monitoring and further context are recommended to assess actual threat levels."
