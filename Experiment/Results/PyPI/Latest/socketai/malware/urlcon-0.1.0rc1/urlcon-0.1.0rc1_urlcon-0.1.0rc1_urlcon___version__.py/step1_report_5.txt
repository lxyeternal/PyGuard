{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string and a safety token, with the potential to decode the token from base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "The safety token stored in __safety_token__ is a base64-encoded string.",
  "sinks": "The decoded safety token could potentially be used for authentication or communication, but no explicit sink such as network communication or file writing is present.",
  "flows": "The base64-encoded token can be decoded using the b64decode function, but there is no further usage or flow shown in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, reveals a URL and some code-like text could suggest an attempt to obfuscate malicious intent. The code imports only a decoding function and does not perform any other actions, which could indicate hiding malicious payloads or instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 decoding function and stores a version string and an encoded token. The token, once decoded, contains a URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/b47g1z9z) and some code-like text. No further actions or execution are present, but the encoded string suggests possible retrieval or execution of malicious payloads at the decoded URL. The code itself is minimal and does not perform any visible malicious activity, but the presence of a base64-encoded URL is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple but contains obfuscated content in the form of a base64-encoded string that reveals an external URL and possibly code. Without further context or execution, the code alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and external URL are suspicious indicators of potential malicious activity or payloads to be fetched or executed later.",
