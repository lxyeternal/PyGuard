{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script installs a Python package and performs a custom action during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username; and makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL.",
  "targets": "The external URL request can transmit collected system data, potentially leaking user information to an external server.",
  "flows": "The script collects hostname, cwd, and username; then sends this data via a GET request to an external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system information to an external server during install without user consent, and the URL used appears suspicious and may be malicious. The request occurs immediately upon installation, which is unusual behavior for legitimate setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that extends setuptools' install command. During the run method, it collects sensitive system info: hostname, current directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to an external URL, potentially exfiltrating user data. The URL appears suspicious, possibly a command-and-control or tracking server. This behavior indicates malicious intent, such as data exfiltration. The code’s purpose seems to be malicious, exploiting the package installation process to gather and send system information covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior intended to exfiltrate user system information during package installation. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
