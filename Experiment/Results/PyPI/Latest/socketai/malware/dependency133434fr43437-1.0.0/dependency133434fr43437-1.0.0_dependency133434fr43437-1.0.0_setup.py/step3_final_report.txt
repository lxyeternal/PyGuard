  ],
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during package installation, collects hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL. The behavior is covert, with no user notification or consent, indicating malicious intent. The URL appears obfuscated, and the data exfiltration during setup is characteristic of supply chain attacks. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation in the code itself, but the URL's nature raises suspicion. The activity aligns with malicious behavior, and the external request is a clear indicator of data theft or tracking. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation ~0.2) are justified based on the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly exfiltrating system information during package installation. The external URL is suspicious, and the activity poses a high security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the behavior. This package should be flagged as malicious and avoided in supply chain contexts.",
