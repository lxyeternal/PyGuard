{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom installation step that collects system information and sends it to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to send data to an external server",
  "flows": "Information from hostname, current working directory, and username flows from sources to the requests.get() call as URL parameters",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly sends system info to an external domain during installation without user consent; the external URL is suspicious and appears obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and overrides the install command with a custom run method. During installation, it gathers hostname, current directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. The external URL is obfuscated and suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration. No user prompts or explicit consent mechanisms are present. This behavior is consistent with malicious activity aimed at collecting system info covertly. The code appears intentionally designed to leak system details during package installation, which is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during package installation. The code is intentionally obfuscated with a suspicious URL, and the data collection occurs without user awareness. It should be considered a supply chain security threat and avoided.",
