{
  "purpose": "The setup script installs a Python package and executes a custom installation step that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), the requests.get() call with remote URL",
  "sinks": "requests.get() which sends data to an external server",
  "flows": "system information (hostname, current directory, username) collected during installation is sent via HTTP GET request to external domain",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits sensitive system information during installation without user consent or transparency; the URL used is suspicious and likely malicious; it appears designed for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and additional modules (requests, socket, getpass, os). It defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. During installation, it gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends these via an HTTP GET request to an external, suspicious domain. This behavior is unusual for standard setup scripts and suggests data exfiltration. No other malicious code or backdoors are evident, but the deliberate sending of system info to an external server during package installation is a serious security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation to an external domain. This is indicative of a supply chain attack or malicious package designed for data theft. The behavior is suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
