{
  "purpose": "Define a custom installation process that collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Uses requests.get() to send collected data to a remote URL, potentially leaking user and system information.",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, cwd, and username (sources) are included as URL parameters in the requests.get() call (sink), executing during the install process (trigger).",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation without any user consent or indication. The URL used appears suspicious and possibly malicious. The act of sending environment details remotely is unusual for a normal package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation command to insert additional behavior. It gathers system info and sends it to an external server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is hidden within the setup.py and occurs silently during package installation, indicating possible malicious intent to harvest environment data without user knowledge. The URL used for exfiltration is suspicious and not related to the package's stated purpose. No other malicious payloads or backdoors are evident beyond data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and sending system information during package installation without consent. It leverages a seemingly malicious URL to exfiltrate data, indicating a supply chain attack vector or privacy violation. The overall risk is high, and this package should not be used.",
