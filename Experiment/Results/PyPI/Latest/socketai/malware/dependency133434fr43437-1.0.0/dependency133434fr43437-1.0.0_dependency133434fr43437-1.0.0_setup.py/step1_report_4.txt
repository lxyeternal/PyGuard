{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup with a custom installation behavior that reports system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser(). It also uses the requests library to make an HTTP GET request to an external URL during installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected system data to an external server, which could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The system information is collected as source data and immediately transmitted via the requests.get() call to the specified external URL during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unprompted network request during package installation, which is unusual behavior for a setup script. It collects host, working directory, and username data without user consent. The URL used for data exfiltration appears obfuscated and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py script extends the standard package installation process by including a custom class 'CustomInstall' that overrides the run() method. In this method, it gathers system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. Immediately after, it sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external, obfuscated URL. This behavior is not typical for a setup script, which normally only handles package installation. The network call could be used for malicious tracking, system fingerprinting, or data exfiltration without user consent. The code does not perform any validation or error handling around the request, further indicating potential malicious intent. The use of external URL and the collection of environment details during install are suspicious and align with malicious activities such as user tracking or information harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system details during package installation and transmitting them to an external server without user consent. The obfuscated URL and data exfiltration during setup suggest malicious intent, making this package potentially dangerous for supply chain security.",
