      "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, representing a significant privacy and security risk. The current malware scores are underestimated; they should be increased to approximately 0.8 to reflect the exfiltration behavior. The security risk score is justified at around 0.9. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, this pattern indicates malicious or highly suspicious activity that warrants caution and potential removal or modification before deployment."
