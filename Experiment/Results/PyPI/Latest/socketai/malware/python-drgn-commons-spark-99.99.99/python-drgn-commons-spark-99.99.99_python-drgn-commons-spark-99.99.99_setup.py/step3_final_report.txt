{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information such as OS details, IP addresses, hostname, current directory, and user info during package installation, then exfiltrates this data to a remote webhook endpoint.",
  "sources": "Commands executed via os.popen() and os.system() to gather system info, user info, and network info.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request sent via curl to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, transmitting the collected data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command outputs into a formatted string, then into a curl command that transmits it externally during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unencrypted, unsolicited data exfiltration during package installation; static webhook URL; no user notification or consent; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code executes platform-specific commands to gather sensitive system data and transmits this information externally via a hardcoded webhook during installation. The commands used are standard system info commands, and the data is sent unencrypted without user awareness. No malicious payloads like code execution, backdoors, or destructive actions are present. The behavior resembles covert data exfiltration or surveillance. The scores assigned in the reports vary, but given the privacy invasion and data transmission, the malware score should be increased to reflect higher malicious potential. The current low malware scores underestimate the risk; a score around 0.8 is more appropriate. The security risk score is justified as high (around 0.8-0.9) due to privacy violations and external data transfer. The code is clear, with no obfuscation. Overall, the behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, representing a significant privacy and security risk. The current malware scores are underestimated; they should be increased to approximately 0.8 to reflect the exfiltration behavior. The security risk score is justified at around 0.9. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, this pattern indicates malicious or highly suspicious activity that warrants caution and potential removal or modification before deployment.",
