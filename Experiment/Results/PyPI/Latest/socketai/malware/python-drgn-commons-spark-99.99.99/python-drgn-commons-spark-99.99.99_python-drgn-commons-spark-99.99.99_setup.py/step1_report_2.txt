{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it via a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen calls for system info, hostname, whoami, curl commands for external IP, and os.system call for posting data to Slack.",
  "sinks": "os.popen and os.system commands executing shell commands; the curl command posts sensitive data (system info) to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (os.popen and os.system) gather system data → Data is formatted into a JSON string → Data is sent via curl to an external Slack webhook.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes system commands to collect detailed system information and then transmits this data to an external endpoint without user consent or explicit purpose; use of hardcoded webhook URL is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during installation, executes system commands to collect detailed system information such as OS details, IP addresses, hostname, user info, and process list. It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL, revealing potentially sensitive system data externally. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, which is suspicious in the context of package installation. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present, but the data collection and external transmission raise privacy and security concerns. The use of hardcoded webhook URL suggests potential misuse or covert data collection. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications, but the information gathering and transmission pattern is unusual for a standard setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection during package installation and transmits it to an external Slack webhook without clear justification, indicating suspicious behavior. Although it does not contain malware like backdoors or malicious payloads, the privacy-invading behavior warrants caution.",
