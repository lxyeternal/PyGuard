  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for 'uname -a', 'ifconfig', 'curl ifconfig.me', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'whoami', 'hostname'; os.system() call for sending data to Slack.",
  "sinks": "os.popen() outputs stored in variables; os.system() executing a curl command with formatted data sent to external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data from os.popen() calls (system info, network info, user info) flows into string formatting within the os.system() curl command, which transmits data to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed system and user information across different platforms and transmits it unencrypted to a remote URL, which could be used for malicious data exfiltration. The use of 'os.popen()' and 'os.system()' to execute shell commands and send data externally is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, during installation, gathers system information such as OS details, IP addresses, hostname, current directory, and user identity. It then formats this data into a JSON payload and sends it via a curl POST request to a Slack webhook URL. This behavior occurs on all platforms and does not prompt the user for consent or any configuration options. The data collected includes potentially sensitive information like system configuration, network details, and user identity, which are transmitted to an external endpoint without encryption or obfuscation. The code's main activity is data collection and exfiltration, which strongly suggests malicious intent or at least privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly gathers detailed system and user information during installation and exfiltrates it to an external Slack webhook. This behavior is highly suspicious and resembles malicious data exfiltration, violating typical security best practices. It does not appear to serve a legitimate purpose within a standard setup process.",
