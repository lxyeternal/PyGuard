{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to collect system information and send it to a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Reads from system commands such as 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'whoami', 'hostname', and 'systeminfo'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'os.popen' and 'os.system' to execute commands and send data via HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info collected via 'popen' calls flows into the string formatted for the Slack webhook, which is sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects detailed system information and transmits it unencrypted to an external Slack webhook. Uses 'os.popen' and 'os.system' without sanitization; no validation or authentication for the webhook URL is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon running, gathers system details such as OS info, IP addresses, user info, and hostname via various system commands depending on the platform. It then constructs a message containing this info and sends it to a specified Slack webhook URL using an HTTP POST request. The commands executed include potentially sensitive information, and the data is transmitted unencrypted over the network to an external endpoint. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or system reconnaissance. The code does not appear to be malicious in terms of damaging actions but could be used for malicious purposes such as surveillance or data theft. No hardcoded credentials other than the webhook URL are present, and the use of 'os.popen' and 'os.system' for command execution could be misused if the code were modified. The webhook URL appears static and hardcoded, which might be considered suspicious if unknown to the user.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects extensive system information and transmits it to an external service without user consent or encryption, which could be used maliciously for surveillance or data exfiltration. It does not perform harmful actions like damaging files or reverse shells but has privacy and security implications due to unprotected data transmission.",
