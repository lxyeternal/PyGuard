  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'pycblines'. It is intended to be used with setuptools for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package name, version, author, description, and package list; no external or untrusted input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it perform network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is static and declarative, merely setting package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The code follows standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with static package metadata. It does not include any dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or other suspicious behaviors. All data appears hardcoded and standard for Python package setup files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
