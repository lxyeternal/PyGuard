{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'pycblines' Python package, intended for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() call: package name, version, author, description, and packages list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input sources or sensitive data leaks present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration with hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code structures observed. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with static arguments defining package metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, no network activity, and no code execution beyond the standard setup call. It appears to be a typical package setup script without any malicious components or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata for distribution purposes.",
