  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'pycblines' Python package.",
  "sources": "No input sources; standard setup parameters define package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no runtime code execution or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static configuration with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration, then calls 'setup' with static arguments specifying package name, version, author, description, and packages. There are no dynamic elements, no code execution, no input handling, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and standard.",
