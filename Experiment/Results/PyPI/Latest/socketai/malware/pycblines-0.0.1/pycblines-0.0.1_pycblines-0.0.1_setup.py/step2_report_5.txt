  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static setup script for packaging a Python module.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 0.5, with confidence 1.0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n**Does the code contain any malicious behavior?**  \n**No.** The code is a standard setup script importing `setuptools` and calling `setup()` with static package metadata.\n\n**Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n**No.** The code is correct and typical for packaging.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- Malware score: 0 across all reports. This aligns with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- Security risk: 0, as there's no apparent vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and follows standard practices.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior that warrants a higher malware or security risk score.\n\n### Potential adjustments:\n\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0 is justified; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven all the information, I concur with the reports' evaluations. The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No malicious behavior detected.                              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.            |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 | No vulnerabilities or risky behavior identified.           |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and consistent with my assessment.",
