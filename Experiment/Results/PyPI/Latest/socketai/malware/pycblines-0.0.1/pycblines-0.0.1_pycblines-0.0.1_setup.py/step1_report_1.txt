  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging the 'pycblines' Python module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading beyond static package information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as only static package setup code exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and packages. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The package information appears benign and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a module. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
