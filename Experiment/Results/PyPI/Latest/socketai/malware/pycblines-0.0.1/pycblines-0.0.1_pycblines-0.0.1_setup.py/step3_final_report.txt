  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, author, description, packages.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "None; static data without dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard setup code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static setup script using setuptools, defining package metadata without any dynamic inputs, external data fetching, or code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The description field being 'None' is unusual but not malicious. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
