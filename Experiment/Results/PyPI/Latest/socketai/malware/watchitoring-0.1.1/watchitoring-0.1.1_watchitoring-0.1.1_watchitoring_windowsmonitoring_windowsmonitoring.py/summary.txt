  "conclusion": "This code is highly malicious, functioning as a comprehensive Windows data stealer with network exfiltration capabilities. The presence of hardcoded credentials, broad data collection, and SSL bypass strongly indicate malicious intent. The malware score is justified at 0.95, with a security risk score also at 0.95, reflecting the high threat level."
