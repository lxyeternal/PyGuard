  "conclusion": "The code is a standard abstract template with a utility method that can weaken security if misused. It does not contain malicious behavior but includes a security-sensitive feature that warrants caution. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and a moderate security risk score (~0.3-0.4). Proper safeguards should be in place to prevent unintentional SSL bypass in production environments."
