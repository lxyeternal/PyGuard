  "purpose": "Template for a sender module in a monitoring tool, designed to send collected data via HTTPS.",
  "sources": "Methods that could potentially read or handle data: __get_sender_data, __send_archive, run.",
  "sinks": "The SSL context disabling in _create_unverified_https, which affects HTTPS certificate validation.",
  "flows": "Data collection through __get_sender_data and __send_archive, and the SSL context modification affecting all subsequent HTTPS connections.",
  "anomalies": "Disabling SSL certificate verification via ssl._create_default_https_context, which undermines HTTPS security.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class for a data sender, with methods to get data, send data, and modify SSL context to disable certificate verification. Disabling SSL verification can allow man-in-the-middle attacks, making it a security concern. No other malicious behaviors, such as network exfiltration or backdoors, are evident. The code is structurally standard for a monitoring tool template, but the SSL context override is a notable security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is not malicious but contains a security risk by disabling SSL verification, which can be exploited if misused. It appears to be a template for legitimate data transmission, but the SSL disabling function should be used cautiously.",
