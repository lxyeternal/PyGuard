  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring in a cross-platform manner.",
  "sources": "platform.system() to determine OS, instantiation of MacMonitoring, InputMonitor, and conditionally WindowsMonitoring",
  "sinks": "Start monitoring threads, potentially related to system input or system metrics collection",
  "flows": "platform.system() output → conditional instantiation of monitoring objects → thread start for monitoring functions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; use of threading for monitoring functions is typical; no suspicious network activity or data leaks detected",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system using platform.system(), then starts threads to run input and system monitoring objects tailored to macOS or Windows. These monitoring objects are imported from a monitoring library, and their start/run methods are invoked in threads. No input data is processed directly in this code, nor are there any apparent data sinks or network activity. The purpose appears to be system monitoring, a common legitimate function. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of threading is standard for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code initializes platform-specific system and input monitoring via threading, with no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate system monitoring setup.",
