  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "Reads the platform information using platform.system() and instantiates monitor objects; starts monitoring threads.",
  "sinks": "Starts monitoring threads that run potentially continuous monitoring functions, which could be misused if malicious code is present in the imported modules or monitoring functions.",
  "flows": "platform.system() → conditional branch → thread creation and start → monitor run methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present in this snippet. The actual monitoring functions are imported from external modules, so their content cannot be verified here.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the OS platform and starts corresponding monitoring threads for Mac or Windows. It imports monitoring classes and starts their run methods in separate threads. No suspicious logic, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident in this code. The only potential concern is reliance on external modules which could contain malicious code, but based on this code alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended to set up system monitoring based on OS, which is typical for legitimate system monitoring tools. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent in this snippet itself.",
