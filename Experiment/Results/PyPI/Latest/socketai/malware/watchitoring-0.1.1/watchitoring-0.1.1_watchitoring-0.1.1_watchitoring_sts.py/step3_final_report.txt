{
  "purpose": "The code detects the operating system platform and initiates system or input monitoring in separate threads based on the platform.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call for OS detection; instantiation of monitoring classes (MacMonitoring, WindowsMonitoring, InputMonitor).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; external modules could contain sinks if malicious, but not evident here.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines platform; corresponding monitoring class's run/start_monitoring method is invoked in a thread.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward platform detection and thread starting. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs OS detection using platform.system(), then starts input monitoring in a thread. If on macOS, it starts MacMonitoring; if Windows, it starts WindowsMonitoring. All imported modules are external and could contain malicious code, but the snippet itself is benign. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are present. The threading approach is standard for monitoring tasks. No data leaks or malicious data exfiltration points are evident. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no malicious intent. External modules' trustworthiness cannot be assessed here, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard platform-specific monitoring setup with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware (0), obfuscated (0), and risk (~0.15-0.2) scores are appropriate, assuming external modules are benign. No modifications are necessary based on this snippet.",
