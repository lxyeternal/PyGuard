  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring threads for macOS or Windows.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection, InputMonitor().start_monitoring for input monitoring, MacMonitor().run and WindowsMonitor().run for system monitoring.",
  "sinks": "Thread targets that execute monitoring functions; potential data collection points.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines platform -> threads run monitoring functions which may collect system/input data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of threading for system monitoring is typical; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and initiates separate threads to run monitoring functions for input and system activities. It imports monitoring classes from specific modules, likely designed for system surveillance. The threading approach is standard for asynchronous monitoring. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The code structure and imports suggest benign system monitoring behavior, assuming the imported modules are legitimate. No obfuscated code, hidden functions, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to set up system and input monitoring in a platform-specific manner without any malicious intent. It is consistent with legitimate monitoring tools, assuming the imported modules are trusted. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
