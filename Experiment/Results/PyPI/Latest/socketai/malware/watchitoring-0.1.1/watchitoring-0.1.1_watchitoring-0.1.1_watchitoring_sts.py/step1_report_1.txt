  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call, imports of monitoring classes, threading.Thread instantiations for monitor start methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of monitoring methods that may collect system data, but no data sinks like network transmission or data storage are evident.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional logic -> threading.Thread targeting monitor run methods -> monitor methods execute.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard threading and platform checks; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically detects the OS platform and initiates corresponding monitoring threads for Mac or Windows. It imports monitoring classes and runs their start methods in separate threads. The logic is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior. The imported modules may perform system monitoring, but the code itself does not contain malicious actions or data exfiltration. The threading approach is standard for concurrent monitoring tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for legitimate system monitoring purposes, dynamically initiating platform-specific monitoring threads. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
