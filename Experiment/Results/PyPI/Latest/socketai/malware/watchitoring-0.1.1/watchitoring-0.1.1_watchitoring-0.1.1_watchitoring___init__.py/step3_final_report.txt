  "purpose": "Platform detection and conditional module import for cross-platform system monitoring setup.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; import statements for monitoring modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "OS detection via platform.system() leading to conditional import of WindowsMonitoring; other modules imported unconditionally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward platform detection using platform.system() and conditionally imports WindowsMonitoring if on Windows. It always imports MacMonitoring, initialize_system_monitoring, and InputMonitor. The code is clear, standard, and lacks any malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity are present. The import pattern is typical for cross-platform modules, and no anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and safe for use. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's nature.",
