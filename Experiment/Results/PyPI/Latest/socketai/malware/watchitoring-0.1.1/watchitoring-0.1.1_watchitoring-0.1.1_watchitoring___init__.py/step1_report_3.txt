{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up platform-specific monitoring classes and initialize modules for system monitoring and input monitoring.",
  "sources": "Reads platform information via platform.system() to determine which modules to import.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; imports are static and based on platform detection.",
  "flows": "Uses platform.system() to decide whether to import WindowsMonitoring; then makes modules available via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic code execution. Conditional import based on platform is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports platform-specific modules, which is common in cross-platform applications. No data leaks, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The import statements are static and straightforward. The code structure does not include any suspicious or malicious constructs. It appears to be a normal module setup for platform-dependent system monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical platform detection and module import setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
