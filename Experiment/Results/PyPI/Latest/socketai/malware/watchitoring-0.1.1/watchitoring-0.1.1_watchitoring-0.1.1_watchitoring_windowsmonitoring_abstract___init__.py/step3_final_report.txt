{
  "purpose": "This code imports the AbstractSender class from a local sender module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a module export definition.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement from .sender and the __all__ list declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external interactions; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no data flows or external data passing through the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a class and declares __all__ for export. All reports confirm its benign nature, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's simplicity. No external data, network activity, or complex logic exists. The code's purpose is standard in Python modules, and the analysis aligns with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import/export pattern with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
