{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define exports for a Python module, importing specific classes and enums for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions present; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules to the exported __all__ list, serving as public API exposure",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures; code is purely import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, indicating module interface setup. No external data sources, no input handling, no data leakage, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package structure.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code serves as a simple interface definition for the package.",
