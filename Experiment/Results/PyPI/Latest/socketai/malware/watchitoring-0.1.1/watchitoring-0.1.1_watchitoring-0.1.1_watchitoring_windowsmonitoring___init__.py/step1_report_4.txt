{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enums from relative modules, likely to be used as an API or library interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module files (windowsmonitoring, enums, utils) and imports specific classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this snippet, such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining the __all__ list, which indicates exported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic behavior are present. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard import statements and an __all__ declaration, which is typical for Python modules meant to specify public API. There is no use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The imported modules might contain further logic, but this fragment alone is safe. The structure and naming do not suggest malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone. It appears to be benign and well-structured.",
