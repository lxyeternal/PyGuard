{
  "purpose": "This code is part of a package that imports specific classes and enums for use elsewhere, likely related to system monitoring or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils, which are likely local package modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports components and defines an __all__ list, which controls public API exposure.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to module imports and namespace exports; no data from external sources or untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports of modules and defines an export list. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or suspicious activity is present. The structure suggests it is part of a larger package meant to expose certain classes and enums for external use.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply re-exports components for external access.",
