{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enums for use in a larger application, likely related to system monitoring or utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; no I/O, network, or external data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; simply re-exports imported symbols",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs; code structure is standard for a module __all__ declaration",
  "analysis": "The code strictly imports modules and symbols, then declares an __all__ list for exports. There are no data processing, user input handling, or network activities. The imports suggest modular design, but no suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The code does not perform any operations or contain any complex logic that could hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module functions solely as an import/export aggregator with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical Python module for organizing code structure. No malware or security issues detected.",
