  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface, importing specific classes and enums from local modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils)",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no dynamic code or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports classes and enums from local modules and defines an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. It contains no logic, data processing, dynamic execution, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or API module, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple expert reviews, all indicating no malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module interface setup with no security concerns or malicious intent. It simply re-exports components for use elsewhere in the package. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
