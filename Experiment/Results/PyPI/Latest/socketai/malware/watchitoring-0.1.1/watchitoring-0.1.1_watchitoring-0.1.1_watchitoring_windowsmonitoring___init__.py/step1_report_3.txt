  "purpose": "This code appears to define an interface or API for a monitoring system, importing classes and enums related to Windows monitoring and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the provided code; no data processing or external data handling occurs here",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing in this snippet; just imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, just module imports and an export list",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from local modules and then exports them via __all__, indicating it is likely part of a larger package interface. There are no signs of data handling, user input processing, or suspicious code activities. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The module structure is typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface definition with no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no security concerns detected in this fragment.",
