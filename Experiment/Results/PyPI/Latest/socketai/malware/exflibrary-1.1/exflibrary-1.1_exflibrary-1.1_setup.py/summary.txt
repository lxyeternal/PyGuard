  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard; the only red flag is the description string indicating malware building. Malware scores should be set to 0, and security risk scores should be moderate (~0.2-0.3) to reflect the suspicious intent. The high malware scores in some reports are unjustified. Overall, the package is safe in code but potentially malicious in intent based on description."
