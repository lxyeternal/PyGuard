  "anomalies": "The description field states 'Library for malware building, educational purposes only,' which explicitly references malicious intent. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata. The only notable aspect is the description explicitly mentioning 'malware building,' which indicates malicious intent. No external inputs, outputs, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior detected in this setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code itself is standard and harmless in terms of technical security, but the explicit mention of 'malware building' in the description indicates malicious purpose in the package's intent. The code does not contain malicious code or security risks, but the intent behind the package is malicious.",
