  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields in setup(), including name, version, packages, description, author, author_email, url, install_requires, classifiers, python_requires.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic input, environment variables, or external data sources; static metadata only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The description string: 'Library for malware building, educational purposes only' is suspicious and indicates malicious intent, but the code itself is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration with no obfuscated or malicious code. The only suspicious element is the description, which explicitly references malware building, suggesting malicious intent. No runtime or network activity is present. The malware and obfuscated scores should be zero, as the code is clear and safe. The security risk score should reflect the suspicious description, perhaps around 0.2-0.3, but not higher, since no malicious code exists. The high malware scores in some reports are unjustified because they overstate risk based solely on description. Adjustments should be made to align scores with actual code behavior and metadata. Overall, the code is safe; the concern is the declared purpose, which warrants caution but not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard; the only red flag is the description string indicating malware building. Malware scores should be set to 0, and security risk scores should be moderate (~0.2-0.3) to reflect the suspicious intent. The high malware scores in some reports are unjustified. Overall, the package is safe in code but potentially malicious in intent based on description.",
