  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, characterized by remote code fetching, stealthy hiding, and silent execution without validation. The behavior aligns with typical malware or backdoor deployment patterns, warranting a malware score of 0.85 and a security risk score of 0.85. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, it should be flagged as malicious and further analyzed, especially the remote script payload."
