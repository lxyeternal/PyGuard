  "sources": "The import statement from .my_module import get_file, which loads a function from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "None evident in this snippet; no data output or external interactions shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from this minimal code; only module import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no unusual or suspicious code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named 'get_file' from a local module, which is a common practice in Python projects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks within this single line. Without additional context or implementation details of 'get_file', no further analysis is possible. The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, merely importing a function from a local module. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues based solely on this snippet.",
