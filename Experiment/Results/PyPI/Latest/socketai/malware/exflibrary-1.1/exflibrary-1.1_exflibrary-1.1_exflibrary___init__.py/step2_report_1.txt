  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .my_module import get_file`.\n- No additional code, data flows, or execution context is provided.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present\n- The code snippet is just an import statement. There are no signs of issues such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **No issues are present** based solely on this import statement.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports\n- The reports are thorough in stating that the code is minimal and benign.\n- They acknowledge the lack of context, which is appropriate.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident; the conclusions are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n### Scores review\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is reasonable.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1 or 0.3), which aligns with the minimal code.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores\n- Since the code is only an import statement, **risk scores should remain very low**.\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores without additional context showing malicious behavior.\n\n### Malware score considerations\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- There is no indication of malicious intent, code injection, or suspicious activity.\n\n### Challenging assumptions\n- Any assumptions that the import could be malicious are unfounded without further context.\n- The reports correctly refrain from speculative claims.\n\n### Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n- Slight variations in confidence and security risk scores are acceptable given the different levels of detail, but overall they are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (most appropriate, given no evidence of security issues)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\nGiven the minimal and benign nature of this code snippet:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall consensus and the lack of any suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is warranted based solely on this import statement.",
