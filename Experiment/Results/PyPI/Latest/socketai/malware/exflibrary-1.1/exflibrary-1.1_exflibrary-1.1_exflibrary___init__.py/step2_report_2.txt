  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided details.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .my_module import get_file`.\n- The code is minimal, with no execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network operations are present.\n- The main concern is whether `get_file` could be malicious or used maliciously.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import `get_file` from local module.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero but justified as minimal risk)\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score is acceptable, given the minimal context. No malware risk.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import may be used for file handling.\n- **Analysis:** The import could lead to file operations, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.3 (low, due to potential but unconfirmed use)\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. The import alone is benign; potential risks depend on how `get_file` is used later.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Code itself is benign.** It is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Malware scores** are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated scores** are 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk scores** are mostly 0, with a slight exception in Report 2, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a minimal potential if `get_file` is misused, but not evident here)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate given the limited code.\n- No changes needed to scores.\n- The code snippet alone does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1             |\n\nThe minimal import statement is safe, and no further action is necessary based on this code snippet.",
