  "purpose": "Import `get_file` from a local module `my_module`.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no additional data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of a function `get_file` from a local module. It contains no execution, data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, given the simplicity and clarity of the import. Security risk scores are also correctly low (0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern based solely on this import statement. Confidence in these conclusions is high (close to 1), as the code is minimal and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned across reports are consistent and appropriate. No further action is necessary based solely on this import statement.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
