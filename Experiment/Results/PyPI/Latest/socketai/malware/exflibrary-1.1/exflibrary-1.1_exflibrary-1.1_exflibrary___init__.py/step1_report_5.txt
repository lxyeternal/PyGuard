  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'get_file' from a local module 'my_module', likely to retrieve or handle files within the application.",
  "sources": "Import statement indicating use of 'my_module.get_file' which may access file data, or data within the module.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of 'get_file' could involve reading files or handling untrusted data, but this cannot be confirmed from the single line.",
  "flows": "Import source 'my_module.get_file' may lead to data processing or file handling operations within the module's code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with only an import statement; no anomalies detected at this level.",
  "analysis": "This snippet imports a function from a local module, which may be used later in the application for file operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior can be inferred solely from this import statement. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to assess any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. Insufficient information to assess deeper security risks.",
