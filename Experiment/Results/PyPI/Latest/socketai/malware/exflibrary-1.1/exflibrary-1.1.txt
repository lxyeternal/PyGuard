      "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard; the only red flag is the description string indicating malware building. Malware scores should be set to 0, and security risk scores should be moderate (~0.2-0.3) to reflect the suspicious intent. The high malware scores in some reports are unjustified. Overall, the package is safe in code but potentially malicious in intent based on description."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion of malicious activity, characterized by remote code fetching, stealthy hiding, and silent execution without validation. The behavior aligns with typical malware or backdoor deployment patterns, warranting a malware score of 0.85 and a security risk score of 0.85. The code is not obfuscated. Overall, it should be flagged as malicious and further analyzed, especially the remote script payload."
