{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python module named 'ccxt-mexc_futures' for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code sources package dependencies via 'install_requires' and gathers package information through 'find_packages()'. It does not read external input during execution.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks, system modifications, or malicious actions. It only performs package setup tasks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external inputs or untrusted sources; the code primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The author, author_email, and url fields are empty but that is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, and metadata. No external input handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. All dependencies are typical for such a setup, and no suspicious behaviors or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any anomalies or malicious intent.",
