{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'ccxt-mexc_futures' Python module.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, and package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions; no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the script only defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Empty author and author_email fields; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The install_requires list is typical for a package depending on 'ccxt' and 'requests'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, utilizing setuptools. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data leakage, or malicious code injections. All elements follow normal packaging conventions. Missing author info is not inherently malicious, but could indicate incomplete or placeholder info. No obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks. The absence of author details is not suspicious in this context but might warrant completion for best practices.",
