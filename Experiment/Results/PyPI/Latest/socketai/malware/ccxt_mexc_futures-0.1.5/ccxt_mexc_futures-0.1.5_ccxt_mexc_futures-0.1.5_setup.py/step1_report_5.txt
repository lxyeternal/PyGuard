  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'ccxt-mexc_futures' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools (setup, find_packages), calls to setup() with package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script simply defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to package a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No external input handling, user data processing, or network communication is present. The script does not perform any dynamic code execution, file manipulation, or sensitive data handling. All elements are typical for a Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python module. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
