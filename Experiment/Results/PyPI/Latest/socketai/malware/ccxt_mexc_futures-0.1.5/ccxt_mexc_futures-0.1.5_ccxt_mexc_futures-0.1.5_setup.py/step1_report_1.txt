  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for packaging the 'ccxt-mexc_futures' Python module.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; configuration data provided directly within the setup script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication is occurring.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks, as this is a standard setup configuration script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code is a typical setup.py file with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package metadata including name, version, packages, description, author info, URL, dependencies, classifiers, and Python version requirement. All elements are standard for a Python package setup. There are no input sources, data leaks, or suspicious code actions. The structure and content are straightforward and typical for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or contain hidden code. It appears safe.",
