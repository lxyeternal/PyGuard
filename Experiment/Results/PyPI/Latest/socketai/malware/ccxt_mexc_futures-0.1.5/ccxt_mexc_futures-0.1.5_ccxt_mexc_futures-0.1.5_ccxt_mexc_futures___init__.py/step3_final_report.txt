{
  "purpose": "This code extends the ccxt library for MEXC API interaction, implementing request signing, order management, and endpoint descriptions with static obfuscated salt and eval-based execution.",
  "sources": "The 'salt' string is a static hex-encoded string evaluated via 'eval'. The 'sign' method reads 'userToken' and constructs headers for API requests.",
  "sinks": "The 'sign' method uses 'eval' on static data, constructs cryptographic signatures, and adds headers with 'userToken'. No external data input or untrusted data flow detected.",
  "flows": "Source: static 'salt' evaluated via 'eval' -> used in signature generation; Source: 'userToken' -> used in signature and headers -> sink: HTTP request headers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval' on a static string 'salt', which is hex-encoded and obfuscated. The 'marshal' and 'base64' imports are unused, possibly indicating obfuscation or leftover code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client extension with request signing. The 'salt' string is obfuscated but static, and 'eval' is used to execute it, which is a security concern but not malicious. The cryptographic practices rely on MD5, which is insecure but not malicious. No network activity or data exfiltration is present. The primary risk stems from 'eval' usage and weak hashing, which could be exploited if the 'salt' is tampered with. Overall, no malware or malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client with minor security concerns due to 'eval' and MD5 usage. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation is minimal but noteworthy. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, risk=0.3.",
