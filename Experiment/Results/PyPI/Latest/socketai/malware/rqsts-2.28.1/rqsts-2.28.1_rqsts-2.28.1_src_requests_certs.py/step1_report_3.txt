  "purpose": "Provides the default CA bundle location using certifi for SSL verification.",
  "sources": "Reads the CA bundle location from certifi's where() function.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The code calls certifi.where() and prints the result; no untrusted input is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the certifi library and outputs the default CA bundle path when run as a main program. It serves a simple utility purpose without processing external or untrusted data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The code appears straightforward and uses standard, reputable libraries. No external network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility script for returning the certifi CA bundle path. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and is safe to use. It appears to be legitimate, with no security risks detected.",
