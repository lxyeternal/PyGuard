{
  "purpose": "This code provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, primarily for use by other modules or scripts requiring CA certificates.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location from the 'certifi' package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The output 'where()' value is printed to the console; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The source is the 'where' function; the sink is the 'print' statement which outputs the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward retrieval and display of the CA bundle location without any suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from 'certifi' and, if executed as the main program, prints the path to the CA bundle. There are no user inputs, network communications, or data manipulations. The code is simple and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to display the default CA certificate bundle path. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
