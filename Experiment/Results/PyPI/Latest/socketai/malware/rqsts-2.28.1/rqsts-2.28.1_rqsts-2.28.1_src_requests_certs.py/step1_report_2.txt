  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' from the certifi package, and the print statement in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the certificate bundle path; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import from certifi -> print of 'where()' output, which is a static path determined by the package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code simply provides a CA bundle path. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a trusted library 'certifi' and outputs its 'where()' function result, which is a standard method for retrieving CA bundle locations. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or data leaks. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The code serves a utility function without any suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves a simple utility purpose. It safely outputs the CA bundle path without any malicious intent or security risks.",
