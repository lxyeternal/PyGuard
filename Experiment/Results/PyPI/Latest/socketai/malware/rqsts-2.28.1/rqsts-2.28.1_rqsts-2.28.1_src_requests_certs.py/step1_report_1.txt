  "purpose": "Provide the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' library, called in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle location; no untrusted data flows or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'where' from 'certifi' and outputs its value, with no data transformations or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and serves a simple purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a single function from a well-known library (certifi) and prints the path to the CA bundle. It contains no user input, network activity, or malicious code. The purpose is benign, mainly to inform users of the CA bundle location. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility script to output the location of the certifi CA bundle. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions as intended with no security concerns.",
