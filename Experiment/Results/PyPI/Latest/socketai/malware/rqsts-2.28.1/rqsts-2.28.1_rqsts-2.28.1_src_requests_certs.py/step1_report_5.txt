{
  "purpose": "The code provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used for SSL verification by the requests library, primarily for packaging or environment configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle path from the 'certifi' library via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The only output is printing the CA bundle path to the console; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "The 'where()' function outputs a trusted CA bundle path which is then printed; no untrusted input flows into any sensitive operation or external system.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are detected. The code is straightforward, does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from 'certifi' to retrieve the default CA bundle path. It then prints this path if run as a main program. There is no input processing, no external data processing, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation present. The code appears to be standard and well-defined for its purpose, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script for retrieving and displaying the default CA certificate bundle location. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
