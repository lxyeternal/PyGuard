  "purpose": "Retrieve and display the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from the 'certifi' package.",
  "sinks": "Output of the 'print(where())' statement, which displays the CA bundle path.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' -> call 'where()' -> print the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal script that imports a trusted function from a well-known library and prints its output. It contains no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The purpose is benign, serving to inform users of the CA bundle location. No obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code's behavior aligns with its intended utility function, and all signals indicate safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign utility with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals and previous reports confirm its safety and transparency.",
