  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward utility that imports `where` from `certifi` and prints its value.\n- All reports agree on its benign nature, with no user input, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code contains no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- The purpose is to inform or log the location of the CA bundle.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **malware:** all reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **obfuscated:** all assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **securityRisk:** all assign 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues are present in the code.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound; no assumptions are made beyond the code's actual behavior.\n- The purpose and flow are well-understood and documented.\n\n**Any recommendations for score adjustments?**\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n- Since the code is entirely benign, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- The code poses no security risk or malicious activity.\n- It is a safe utility script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly assess the code as benign, with appropriate scoring.
