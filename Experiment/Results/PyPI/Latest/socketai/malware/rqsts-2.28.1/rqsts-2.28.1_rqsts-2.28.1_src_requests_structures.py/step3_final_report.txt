{
  "purpose": "Defines internal data structures for case-insensitive dictionary behavior and lookup functionality within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Data is read from constructor parameters, internal attribute access, and method calls such as update, get, and __getitem__.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into __init__ and update methods, then through internal storage (_store and __dict__) during key access and iteration.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict returns self._store.values(), which is incorrect; it should return a new instance. This is a functional bug, not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood data structures with no external data handling, network activity, or code obfuscation. The only notable issue is the bug in the copy() method, which affects functionality but not security. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to expected behaviors for such classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of internal data structures with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only issue is a minor bug in the copy() method, which does not impact security. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation to 0, and security risk to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
