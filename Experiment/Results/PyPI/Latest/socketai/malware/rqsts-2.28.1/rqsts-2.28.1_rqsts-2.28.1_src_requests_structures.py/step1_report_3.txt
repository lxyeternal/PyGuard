  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and a simple lookup dictionary used within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), attribute access (__getitem__, get), and update methods in classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Data is stored and retrieved within class instances; no external data flow or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which allows case-insensitive key handling while preserving original key case, and LookupDict, a simple dict subclass with custom __repr__ and __getitem__. Both classes handle data internally without external I/O or network communication. Methods perform standard dictionary operations. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicate normal utility functions within the Requests package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, well-structured data utility classes with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
