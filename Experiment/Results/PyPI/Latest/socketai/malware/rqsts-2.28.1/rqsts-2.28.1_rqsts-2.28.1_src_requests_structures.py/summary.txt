  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of internal data structures with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only issue is a minor bug in the copy() method, which does not impact security. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation to 0, and security risk to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness."
