  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for header validation and string conversion within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to to_native_string (possibly bytes or str), and unicode_is_ascii (str).",
  "sinks": "decode in to_native_string, encode in unicode_is_ascii.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into decoding or encoding functions for string normalization or ASCII validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard regex validation for headers and straightforward string handling functions. No network, file, or dynamic code execution present. decode and encode are used safely in context, typical for utility functions. No malicious patterns or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility code with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
