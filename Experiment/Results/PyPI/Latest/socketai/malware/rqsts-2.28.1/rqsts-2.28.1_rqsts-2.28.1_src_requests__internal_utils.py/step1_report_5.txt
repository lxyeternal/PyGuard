  "purpose": "Provide internal utility functions for handling string conversions and header validation in the requests library.",
  "sources": "import statements, re.compile patterns, the to_native_string function, the unicode_is_ascii function",
  "sinks": "decoding in to_native_string, encoding in unicode_is_ascii",
  "flows": "input strings are checked and potentially decoded or encoded, but no external or untrusted sources are directly involved within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation, which are standard and non-malicious. The to_native_string function converts any input to a string, decoding bytes if necessary, but does not perform any external network or system calls. The unicode_is_ascii function checks for ASCII characters and raises an assertion if the input is not a string. Both functions are standard utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code is consistent with typical request utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility code for string handling and header validation, with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
