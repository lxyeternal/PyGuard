  "purpose": "Utility functions for internal use in the Requests library, primarily for header validation and string handling.",
  "sources": "import re, from .compat import builtin_str, input data from function arguments",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effect are present; functions perform data validation and conversion only.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings, bytes) flows through validation and conversion functions, with no external or system side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior detected; code performs standard validation and conversion tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex patterns for header validation, a function to convert input to native strings, and a function to check if a string contains only ASCII characters. All operations are standard string handling routines. No hardcoded secrets, external calls, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code relies on imported utilities and regular expressions, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. It appears to be straightforward utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard utility functions for string validation and conversion within the Requests library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It is safe and typical for its purpose.",
