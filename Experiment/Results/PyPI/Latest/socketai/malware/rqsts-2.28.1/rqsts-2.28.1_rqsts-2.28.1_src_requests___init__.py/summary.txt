  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, performing necessary environment validation and setup without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to dependency validation practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, which is justified given dependency checks but not indicative of malicious activity."
