  "purpose": "This code defines static metadata variables for the 'requests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static metadata only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of decorative ASCII art comment, which is benign and purely aesthetic.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static variable assignments with no dynamic or executable logic. No input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The ASCII art comment does not influence execution or security. All indicators point to benign package metadata declaration. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless package metadata file with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are justified. No further action or warnings are necessary.",
