  "purpose": "Provides cookie management utilities, including extraction, creation, and compatibility wrappers for the requests library.",
  "sources": "Request URL, headers, cookie attributes, response headers",
  "sinks": "Cookie header generation, cookie jar updates, cookie extraction into jar",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers -> cookie extraction and creation functions -> cookie jar management",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling classes and functions, utilizing common libraries and patterns. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. Functions serve typical purposes such as extracting cookies, creating cookie objects, and managing cookie jars. Error handling and thread safety measures are appropriate. The code is readable, well-structured, and aligns with expected behavior for cookie utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of cookie management utilities for the requests library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
