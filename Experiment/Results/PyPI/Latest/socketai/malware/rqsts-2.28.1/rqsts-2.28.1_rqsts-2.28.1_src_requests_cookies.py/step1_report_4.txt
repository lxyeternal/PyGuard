  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies with requests, including creating, managing, and extracting cookies into a CookieJar object.",
  "sources": "Reads input from request objects (e.g., request URL, headers, cookies), and response headers (via response._original_response.msg).",
  "sinks": "Generates Cookie headers for requests, extracts cookies from responses into CookieJar, manipulates cookies (set, delete, update).",
  "flows": "Input request headers and URL → create MockRequest/MockResponse objects → extract cookies into CookieJar; CookieJar modifications → generate cookie headers for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code primarily deals with cookie management, with standard operations.",
  "analysis": "The code offers standard cookie handling functionality, converting between various cookie representations, extracting cookies from responses, and preparing headers for requests. It employs common practices for managing cookies and ensures compatibility with different cookie jar implementations. No evidence of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The functions perform typical tasks such as cookie creation, extraction, merging, and deletion, all within expected parameters. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are apparent. Overall, the code appears legitimate and intended solely for cookie management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie handling utilities for requests. It provides compatibility features, cookie extraction, and management functions without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. There are no indicators of malware, secret exfiltration, or security compromise within this module.",
