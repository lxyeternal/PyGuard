  "purpose": "Provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies in the requests library, including classes and functions for managing cookies, converting cookies from various formats, and extracting cookies from responses.",
  "sources": "Reads request URLs, headers, and cookie data; accesses response headers and response message attributes; processes cookies from request and response objects.",
  "sinks": "Generates cookie headers, updates or clears cookies in the CookieJar, manipulates request headers, and creates or modifies cookie objects.",
  "flows": "Extracts cookies from response into CookieJar; creates cookie headers for requests; adds, updates, or removes cookies based on input parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; standard cookie management logic; no unusual code constructs or obfuscated patterns; consistent use of libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie management utilities, including wrapping request and response headers, converting cookies from Morsel objects, and managing cookie storage via CookieJar and its subclasses. It includes functions to extract cookies from responses, generate cookie headers, and manipulate cookie collections. The classes and functions adhere to typical patterns for cookie handling and do not contain hidden or malicious behaviors. There are no indications of code injection, data exfiltration, or system damage mechanisms. The code does not connect to external domains, execute arbitrary code, or perform any unauthorized actions. All third-party library use appears legitimate and intended for compatibility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of cookie handling utilities for the requests library, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It provides necessary functionality for cookie management and compatibility without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
