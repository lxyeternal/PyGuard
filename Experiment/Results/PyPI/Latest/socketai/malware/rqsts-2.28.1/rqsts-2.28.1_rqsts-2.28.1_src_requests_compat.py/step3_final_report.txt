{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility support for Python 2 and 3, including import resolution and type definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, dynamic import of character detection libraries, version info checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; mainly internal setup and compatibility functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import resolution and type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility layer with safe dynamic imports of known libraries, version checks, and type definitions. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute system commands. The dynamic import of 'chardet' and 'charset_normalizer' is benign, involving only known, reputable libraries. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate compatibility across Python versions, with no security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, straightforward code with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
