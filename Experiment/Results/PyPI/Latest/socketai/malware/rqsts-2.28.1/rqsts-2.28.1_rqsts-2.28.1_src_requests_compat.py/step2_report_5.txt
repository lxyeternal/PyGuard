  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is straightforward compatibility boilerplate, with no malicious behavior or security risks.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no untrusted data handling, no obfuscated code. The dynamic import of character detection libraries is safe as it involves only known, trusted modules.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; the code is a benign compatibility layer.  \n- **Analysis:** No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The code only sets up compatibility utilities.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Standard compatibility and utility setup code, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no untrusted data processing, no obfuscated code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Compatibility code with no signs of malicious activity, but notes a small security risk score of 0.1.  \n- **Analysis:** The only notable point is the securityRisk score, which is slightly above zero. The code involves dynamic imports and environment detection, but these are standard practices. There are no actual vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n- **Justification:** The minimal securityRisk score might reflect a conservative stance due to dynamic imports, but since there's no actual vulnerability or malicious behavior, this is probably an overestimation.  \n- **Recommendation:** Lower the securityRisk to 0 unless there's an explicit concern about dynamic imports or environment detection being exploited, which is unlikely here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard compatibility code with no malicious intent.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no data leaks, no obfuscated code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0, with one (Report 4) at 0.1. Given the nature of the code, this is an overly cautious estimate. The code only performs safe imports and environment detection, which are standard and pose no security risk.\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk:** 0 (the minimal security risk score is appropriate; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are present)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured compatibility module with no malicious or suspicious features. The slight security risk score in one report can be safely reduced to zero, aligning with the rest. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and free of vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
