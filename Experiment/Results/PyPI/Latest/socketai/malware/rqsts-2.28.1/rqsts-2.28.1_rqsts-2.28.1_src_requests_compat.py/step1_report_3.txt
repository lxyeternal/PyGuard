  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling string types, character detection libraries, and URL parsing in the requests package.",
  "sources": "importlib, sys, simplejson (if available), collections, http, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct sinks that process untrusted input leading to data leaks or code execution; mainly imports and definitions.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily sets up compatibility and imports libraries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code contains standard compatibility logic; nothing suspicious or malicious detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages backward compatibility across Python versions, imports optional JSON libraries, and defines type aliases. It performs standard environment detection without executing any untrusted code or network operations. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present. All imported modules are standard and used for compatibility and utility functions. No data leakage, credential handling, or harmful behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility and utility setup code for the requests library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful for its intended use.",
