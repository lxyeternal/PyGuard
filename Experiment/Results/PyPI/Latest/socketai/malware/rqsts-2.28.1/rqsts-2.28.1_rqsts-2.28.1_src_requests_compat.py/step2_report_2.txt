  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, well-structured compatibility layer for Python 2/3 support.\n- No mention of untrusted data processing, network activity, or environment modifications.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code detected.\n- The dynamic import of character detection libraries is benign, involving only known libraries (\"chardet\", \"charset_normalizer\") with no external inputs.\n- The code's purpose is solely to facilitate compatibility and utility functions, with no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Presence of no malicious or suspicious code**.\n- **No obfuscation or malicious patterns**.\n- **No dangerous sinks or data flows**.\n- **Dynamic imports are safe and limited to known, trusted libraries**.\n- **No hardcoded secrets or credentials**.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard compatibility module, with no malicious or security-risk behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|------------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0          | 0            | 0     |\n| 2       | 0          | 0            | 0     |\n| 3       | 0          | 0            | 0     |\n| 4       | 0          | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 5       | 0          | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- The security risk score in report 4 is 0.1, slightly above zero. Given the analysis, this seems unwarranted; the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- For report 4, the security risk score should be adjusted to 0, aligning with the overall benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- No evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n- The code performs only compatibility setup, with no data processing or external system interaction.\n- Dynamic import is safe, limited to known libraries, with no untrusted input involved.\n\n**Therefore, all scores should be 0**.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign compatibility layer with no security concerns. The scores in the reports are appropriate, except for report 4's security risk score, which should be lowered from 0.1 to 0.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the absence of any suspicious or malicious elements.",
