{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3, imports necessary modules, and defines some utility functions and variables for character detection and URL handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like importlib, sys, simplejson (conditional), collections, http, io, urllib, and built-in functions/variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sink points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, resolving character detection libraries, setting Python version flags, and defining utility variables/functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility imports and checks, using safe import practices. The only dynamic aspect is the character detection library resolution, which is benign. No user input or untrusted data processing occurs. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present. It appears to be a normal utility module for handling compatibility issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility module without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use in Python projects.",
