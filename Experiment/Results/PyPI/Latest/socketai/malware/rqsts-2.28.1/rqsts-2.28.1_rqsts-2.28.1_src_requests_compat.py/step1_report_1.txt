{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, including character detection, JSON handling, and URL parsing.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module (dynamic import), sys.version_info (reads Python version), import statements (json, simplejson, collections, http, io, urllib), standard library functions and modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions. No network, file, or environment variable access beyond standard library usage.",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flows from source to sink; code primarily sets up compatibility abstractions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed. The code is straightforward compatibility boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules conditionally based on availability, resolves character detection libraries dynamically, and assigns standard types for compatibility. It uses safe, well-known practices for backward compatibility without performing any data processing, network communication, or system modification. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The dynamic import of character detection libraries does not involve untrusted inputs. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility module for Python 2/3 support, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
