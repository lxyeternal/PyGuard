{
  "purpose": "The module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling character detection, JSON parsing, and URL operations across different Python versions, mainly for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as importlib, sys, simplejson or json, collections, http.cookies, io, and urllib modules for URL parsing and HTTP proxy handling.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains clear sinks that process untrusted or external data directly, such as executing code, writing to files, or network communication.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are evident; the code only imports and sets up compatibility functions without processing external input or data streams.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected. The code uses standard, well-known libraries purely for compatibility and utility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for compatibility across Python versions, importing modules conditionally, and defining utility functions and variables. It does not execute or evaluate untrusted data, nor does it perform any network operations or file manipulations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward and typical for a compatibility layer.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard practice for maintaining backward compatibility in Python projects and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
