{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as some utility functions for character detection and URL handling.",
  "sources": "importlib for dynamic module loading, sys for version info, standard library modules such as json, collections, http, io, urllib, and built-in functions/variables.",
  "sinks": "None of the imported modules or code segments appear to directly process untrusted data sources or handle user input in a way that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes variables and imports modules; there are no explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, nor data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code performs standard compatibility and utility functions without any obfuscated or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for handling differences between Python versions, importing modules conditionally, and setting up some common utilities. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms. The dynamic import resolution is standard and limited to known libraries. No external untrusted input is processed, and no suspicious network or system activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard compatibility and utility module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It mainly manages imports, version checks, and setup for compatibility, which are typical for such modules.",
