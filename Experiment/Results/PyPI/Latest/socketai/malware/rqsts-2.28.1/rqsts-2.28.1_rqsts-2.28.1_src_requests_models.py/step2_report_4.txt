  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard request/response handling, with no malicious behavior. Hooks are user-defined and could execute malicious code if hooks are compromised, but this is typical and outside the module's control.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — reasonable, considering hooks could be misused if user-supplied.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The code is standard, and the malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — same reasoning.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No concerns. The assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard request/response handling, no malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** The code appears secure and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard implementation, no malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard, legitimate nature of the code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the others.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code content:** All reports confirm the code is a standard, well-structured HTTP request/response handling module.\n- **Malware assessment:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors in the provided code.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is the user-definable hooks, which could execute malicious code if hooks are compromised externally. However, this is a common pattern in such libraries and not an inherent flaw.\n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects the potential misuse of hooks but is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at **0**, no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the standard nature and no malicious indicators, a **risk score of around 0.2** is appropriate, reflecting minor concerns about user-defined hooks.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (minor risk due to user hooks, but standard practice)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
