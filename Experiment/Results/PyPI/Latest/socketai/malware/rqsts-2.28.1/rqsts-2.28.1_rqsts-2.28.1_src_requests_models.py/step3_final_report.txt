{
  "purpose": "The code implements a standard HTTP request and response handling library, managing request construction, encoding, headers, cookies, hooks, and response parsing without any embedded malicious logic.",
  "sources": "Input data from user parameters (headers, data, json, params, cookies, hooks), URL parsing, and request body encoding functions.",
  "sinks": "Headers, request body, cookies, hooks, and response content; no unsafe data flows or external network activities are present within this module.",
  "flows": "User inputs (headers, data, hooks, URL) flow into request preparation methods, which encode and set headers, cookies, and body, then generate a PreparedRequest object. Response handling involves reading raw data, decoding, and parsing headers.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; the code uses standard libraries and practices. Hooks are user-defined, which could be misused if hooks are compromised, but this is a known pattern and not an inherent flaw.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of an HTTP client, with clear data flows from user inputs to request and response objects. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The only potential security concern is the execution of user-defined hooks, which is typical in extensible systems. The encoding, URL parsing, and error handling follow best practices, with no signs of code injection, data leakage, or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure HTTP request/response handling library with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low risk score (0.2) appropriately reflects the potential misuse of user-defined hooks but does not indicate any inherent vulnerabilities.",
