  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility shim that manipulates sys.modules for namespace management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The technique used is known and acceptable in package maintenance, though it could be misused if environment is compromised. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
