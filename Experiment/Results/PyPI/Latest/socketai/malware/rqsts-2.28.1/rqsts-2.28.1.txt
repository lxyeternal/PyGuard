The security risk is minimal, primarily related to dependency validation practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2, which is justified given dependency checks but not indicative of malicious activity."

The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness."

The technique used is known and acceptable in package maintenance, though it could be misused if environment is compromised. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
