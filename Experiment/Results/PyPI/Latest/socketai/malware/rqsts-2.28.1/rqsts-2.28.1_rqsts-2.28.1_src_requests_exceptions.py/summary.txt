  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of exception classes with a minor, theoretical risk associated with pickling behavior. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The security risk score should remain low (~0.2), reflecting the pickling concern, but overall the code is safe for typical use."
