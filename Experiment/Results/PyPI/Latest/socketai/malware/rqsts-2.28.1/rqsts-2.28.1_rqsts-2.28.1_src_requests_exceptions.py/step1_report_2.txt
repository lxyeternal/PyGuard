{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for handling various error conditions within the Requests library, primarily related to network, HTTP, and content decoding issues.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from exception instantiations, attribute checks, and class inheritance structures; no external input sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include raising exceptions with specific messages, but there are no data leaks, external calls, or security-sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves constructing exception objects, initializing them with error details, and handling inheritance; no external data flows or untrusted data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions with proper inheritance and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for exceptions related to the Requests library, with typical constructor and method implementations. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are evident. No external data input, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The structure follows standard Python exception class conventions. The only notable aspects are detailed docstrings and inheritance from base exception classes. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library with no indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely to define exception types for error handling.",
