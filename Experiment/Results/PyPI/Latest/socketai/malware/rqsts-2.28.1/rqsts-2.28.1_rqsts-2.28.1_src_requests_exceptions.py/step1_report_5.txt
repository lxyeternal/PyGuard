  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for handling various errors and warnings in the Requests library, mainly for network communication issues.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'urllib3.exceptions' and local '.compat' module; internal class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines exception classes and warnings, with no data input or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from sources to sinks as the code only sets up exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for error handling in the Requests library. It imports necessary exceptions, extends them to create specific error types, and defines warning classes. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. There are no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or data leaks. The structure and content are consistent with standard library code.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward set of exception and warning class definitions for the Requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious anomalies or malicious code are present.",
