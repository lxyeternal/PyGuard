{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error scenarios in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily consists of class definitions and imports.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines exception classes without any runtime data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exceptions and defines numerous custom exceptions for request-related errors, such as connection issues, timeouts, URL errors, and warnings. The class structure follows standard Python practices with inheritance to categorize exceptions appropriately. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or data handling is present. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are found. The purpose appears to be standard error handling within a well-known library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes for the Requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code serves its intended purpose effectively and securely.",
