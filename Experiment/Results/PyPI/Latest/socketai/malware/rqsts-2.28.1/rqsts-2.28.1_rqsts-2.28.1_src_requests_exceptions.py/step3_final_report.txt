  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various request errors and warnings in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance structures; no external data input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "N/A – purely class definitions with inheritance, no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError affects pickling behavior, which could be exploited if untrusted data is unpickled.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no malicious code or suspicious patterns. The only notable aspect is the __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError, which influences pickling behavior. While this could pose a security concern if untrusted pickling occurs, it is a common pattern in exception classes and generally safe when used properly. The code is clear, straightforward, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe set of exception classes with a minor, theoretical risk associated with pickling behavior. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The security risk score should remain low (~0.2), reflecting the pickling concern, but overall the code is safe for typical use.",
