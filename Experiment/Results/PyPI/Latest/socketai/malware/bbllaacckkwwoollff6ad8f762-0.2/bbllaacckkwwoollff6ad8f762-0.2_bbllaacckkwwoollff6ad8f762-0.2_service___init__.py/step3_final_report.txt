  "purpose": "A simple print statement indicating service module initialization, serving as a benign logging or startup message.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static code with no data reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code executes a single print statement with static content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static print statement. It does not read input, process data, or interact with external systems. All reviews confirm its benign nature, with consistent scoring of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The confidence in benignity is high (1), and no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a conclusion of no malicious intent or security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security risks detected. The reports are accurate and consistent, correctly scoring the code as safe. No adjustments or further analysis are necessary.",
