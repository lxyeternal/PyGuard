{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process for a Python package, which, upon installation, executes remote code and potentially exfiltrates data.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.environ.get('USER'), urllib.request.urlopen(), exec(body)",
  "sinks": "exec(body) executes code fetched from remote server, sending HTTP PUT request with encoded data",
  "flows": "get_current_username() → exec_command() → urllib.request.urlopen() → exec(body); get_current_username() → send_put_request() (commented out)",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code fetched from remote server; no validation of fetched code; remote code execution capability; commented-out code suggesting potential for data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the current username using os.getlogin() or environment variables. If the username is 'modelarts', it fetches code from a remote server via urllib.request and executes it directly using exec(), which is highly risky and suggests malicious intent. There is also a commented-out section that appears to collect system info ('id' command output), encode it, and send it via an HTTP PUT request to a specific URL, indicating possible data exfiltration. The custom install class triggers this behavior during package installation. The code does not validate remote code before execution and uses exec() directly on fetched data, which is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by executing remote code during package installation, which could lead to system compromise or data theft. The presence of commented-out exfiltration code and remote code execution via exec() indicates high malicious potential.",
