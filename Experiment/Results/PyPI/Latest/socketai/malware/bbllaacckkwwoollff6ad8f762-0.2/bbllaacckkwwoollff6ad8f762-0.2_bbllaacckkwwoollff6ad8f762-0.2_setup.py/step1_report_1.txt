  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.environ.get('USER'), urllib.request.urlopen(), response.read(), exec()",
  "sinks": "exec(body) - executes code fetched from remote server; send_put_request() sends data over HTTP",
  "flows": "get_current_username() -> exec_command() -> urllib.request.urlopen() -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Execution of remote code via exec(body) without validation; sending data to external server; use of getlogin() for username detection",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves the current username and, if it equals 'modelarts', fetches a remote script from a URL and executes it directly with exec(), which can run arbitrary code. It also includes a function to send data over HTTP but this function is commented out. The remote code execution via exec() is highly suspicious and could be malicious. The code does not perform any validation or sandboxing on the fetched code, representing a serious security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script executes remote code based on username without validation, which is a classic indicator of malicious behavior. It may be used to introduce backdoors, execute arbitrary commands, or perform malicious activities during package installation.",
