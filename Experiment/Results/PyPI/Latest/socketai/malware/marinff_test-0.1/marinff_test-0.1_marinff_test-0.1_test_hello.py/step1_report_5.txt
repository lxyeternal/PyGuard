  "purpose": "Defines a simple function to print 'hello world' and executes it when the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the if statement: '=' should be '=='. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic Python script with a function 'hello' that prints a message. The conditional statement is intended to run the function when the script is executed directly. However, it contains a syntax error ('if __name__ = \"__main__\"') instead of the correct 'if __name__ == \"__main__\"'. This error would prevent the script from running properly but does not indicate malicious intent. No external inputs, dangerous code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script with a syntax mistake. There is no malicious behavior or security concern identified.",
