  "purpose": "Simple demonstration function to print 'hello world'",
  "sources": "The script reads the module execution context to determine if it is run as the main program",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to the console, which is a trusted operation",
  "flows": "The main block triggers the hello() function, which outputs a static string",
  "anomalies": "The conditional check has a syntax error: using '=' instead of '==' in the if statement, which prevents proper execution; no other unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function that prints a greeting. It contains a syntax error in the if statement ('=' instead of '=='), which would prevent the script from running correctly. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data inputs, or suspicious behaviors. The code is very simple and appears intended for educational or illustrative purposes. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, non-malicious example with a syntax error. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
