  "purpose": "Simple script to print 'hello world' when executed",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output channels that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or untrusted data processing",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in the line 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":', which should use '==' instead of '='",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello()' that prints a greeting. The conditional block intended to execute 'hello()' if the script runs as the main module contains a syntax error. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious behavior are present. The syntax error prevents proper execution but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign script with a syntax error that prevents execution. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
