{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple function to print 'hello world' and executes it when run as a script.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console via print(), which is a trusted sink.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no untrusted data sources or flows.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the if statement: '=' should be '==', which causes a syntax error; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic 'hello world' script with a syntax error in the main guard, which prevents execution. There are no data flows, external inputs, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure is simple and straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or anomalies beyond the typo.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and intended as a simple demonstration. The syntax error is a minor bug, not a malicious feature. No malware or security risks are present.",
