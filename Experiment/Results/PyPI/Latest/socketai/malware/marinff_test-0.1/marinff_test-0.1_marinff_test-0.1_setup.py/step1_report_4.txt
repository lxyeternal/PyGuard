{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that, after installation, executes a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP (LHOST) and port (LPORT) variables, and constructs a reverse shell command that is base64-encoded.",
  "sinks": "The encoded reverse shell command is decoded and executed via os.system, leading to potential remote access to the system where the package is installed.",
  "flows": "The code creates a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it with os.system, establishing a network connection to an attacker-controlled server.",
  "anomalies": "The code embeds hardcoded IP and port, constructs a reverse shell payload, encodes it in base64, and executes it automatically during installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious. There is a typo in 'socket' as 'secket', which would cause runtime error, but the intent suggests malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools install command to include malicious behavior. It constructs a reverse shell command, which is a common attack method, encodes it, and then executes it immediately after installation. The use of base64 encoding is often employed to obfuscate malicious commands. The hardcoded IP and port indicate control by an attacker. The typo 'secket' would prevent execution as-is, but the intended behavior is clearly malicious. This code, if corrected, would provide remote shell access upon installation, representing a severe security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious code designed to establish a reverse shell connection during installation, representing a significant security threat. Despite a typo preventing execution, the intended behavior is clearly malicious.",
