{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package and execute a reverse shell during installation.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command constructed within the CustomInstall class, particularly the 'reverse_shell' string and the encoded command executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded base64-encoded string, which runs a reverse shell connecting back to a specified IP and port.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system during package installation, establishing a network connection to the attacker-controlled server.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated execution via base64 encoding, reverse shell payload embedded directly in the setup script, hardcoded IP and port, execution occurs during installation process, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools installation process by adding a custom run method that, after installing the package, creates a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address and port. The reverse shell command is built as a string, then encoded in base64 to obfuscate its intent, and decoded just before execution with os.system. This behavior is highly unusual and malicious, as it opens a backdoor during the installation phase. The use of hardcoded network parameters and the execution of a reverse shell indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of legitimate functionality, and the code’s structure, including obfuscation and embedded payload, suggests malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden backdoor that establishes a reverse shell connection during package installation, indicative of malicious intent. The use of obfuscation and embedded payload confirms malicious behavior. This package should not be used.",
