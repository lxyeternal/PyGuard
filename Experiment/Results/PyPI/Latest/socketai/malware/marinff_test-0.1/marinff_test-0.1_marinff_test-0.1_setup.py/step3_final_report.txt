{
  "purpose": "The code aims to establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port during package installation, effectively creating a backdoor.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded IP and port variables, base64-encoded reverse shell command embedded in the code.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the decoded command via os.system, which initiates network connection and shell access.",
  "flows": "The code constructs the reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it during the install run, leading to remote shell access.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP and port, use of base64 encoding to obfuscate payload, execution during setup, typo 'secket' instead of 'socket' which would cause runtime error, but does not negate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly creates a reverse shell payload with hardcoded network parameters, obfuscated via base64, and executes it during package installation, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The typo 'secket' would prevent execution unless corrected, but the core malicious intent remains evident. The high malware score (1), high security risk (1), and obfuscation level (~0.8-0.9) are justified based on the code's behavior. The code's purpose is malicious, aiming for remote control of the host system, and the obfuscation seeks to evade detection. The overall assessment confirms a severe security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, embedding a reverse shell payload during installation, with high obfuscation and network-based malicious intent. Despite a typo that would prevent execution as-is, the intent is clear and the behavior dangerous. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
