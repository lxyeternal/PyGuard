  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python module and executes a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "LHOST, LPORT variables, reverse_shell string, encoded base64 payload, os.system call",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing a decoded base64 payload that runs a reverse shell",
  "flows": "Variables LHOST and LPORT are inserted into reverse_shell string, which is then base64 encoded. The encoded payload is decoded and executed via os.system, establishing a reverse shell connection.",
  "anomalies": "Reverse shell code is embedded directly in the setup script, encoded in base64 to obfuscate execution. Uses os.system with inline decoding and execution, which is suspicious. No user input validation or sanitization. Hardcoded IP and port. The reverse shell command appears to be intended for remote code execution and control.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when run, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port. The command is embedded as a string, then base64-encoded to obscure its intent. During execution, the payload is decoded and executed with os.system, establishing a reverse shell back to the specified IP and port. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it allows remote control of the system post-installation. The reverse shell command is crafted to spawn a bash shell, redirecting standard input/output/error to the socket, with environment variable manipulation to prevent command history logging. The obfuscation via base64 encoding further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior — it automatically establishes a reverse shell connection during package installation, representing a supply chain attack vector. The reverse shell payload is embedded and obfuscated, indicating intent to compromise the host system.",
