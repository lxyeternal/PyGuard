{
  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python module and executes a reverse shell upon installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly, but generates a reverse shell command internally.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded command that establishes a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP and port.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, leading to a remote connection.",
  "anomalies": "Contains hardcoded IP address and port; constructs a reverse shell command inside the setup process; uses base64 encoding and decoding to obfuscate execution; the reverse shell code appears malicious and designed for remote control.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, after installing the package, creates a reverse shell payload pointing to a specific IP and port. It encodes this payload in base64, then decodes and executes it using os.system, establishing a remote connection. The presence of a hardcoded IP and port for reverse shell, along with obfuscation via base64, strongly indicates malicious intent. The reverse shell command is executed automatically during package installation, which is suspicious behavior. No external input influences this behavior, but the code’s structure and payload are malicious in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it automatically creates and executes a reverse shell during installation using obfuscated commands and hardcoded connection details. This indicates an attempt at remote access or control, which is malicious.",
