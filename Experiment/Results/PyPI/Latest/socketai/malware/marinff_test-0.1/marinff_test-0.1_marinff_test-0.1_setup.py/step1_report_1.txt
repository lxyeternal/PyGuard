{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python module and executes a reverse shell command during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP address and port, and constructs a reverse shell command that is base64 encoded and executed during installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded base64 string, which runs a reverse shell command that connects back to a specified IP and port, potentially allowing remote control.",
  "flows": "The code encodes the reverse shell command in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, establishing a network connection for remote access.",
  "anomalies": "The script hardcodes the attacker's IP and port, embeds a reverse shell payload within setup.py, encodes it in base64 to evade simple inspection, and executes it automatically during installation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup-related modules and defines a custom install class that overrides the run method. During installation, it constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP and port. The command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed using os.system, creating a remote access backdoor upon package installation. The reverse shell command, although embedded as a string, is malicious in intent, designed for remote control. The use of base64 encoding helps obfuscate the command, and executing such a payload during setup is highly suspicious and indicates malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, as it embeds and executes a reverse shell payload during package installation, enabling unauthorized remote access. This is a clear supply chain attack designed to compromise systems where the package is installed.",
