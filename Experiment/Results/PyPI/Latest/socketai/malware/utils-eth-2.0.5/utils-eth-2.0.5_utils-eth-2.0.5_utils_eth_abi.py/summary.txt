  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Ethereum ABI signature generation. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The cryptographic operations are standard and safe. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), justified by cryptographic use but not indicative of any threat."
