{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to generate Ethereum function and event signatures, and their 4-byte selectors or log topics, by processing ABI data and hashing signatures with keccak.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from ABI dictionaries, specifically 'type', 'components', and 'name' fields.",
  "sinks": "The keccak hashing functions produce cryptographic hashes used as selectors or topics; no external data or system effects are involved.",
  "flows": "Input ABI data flows into signature string construction, which then flows into keccak hashing to produce selectors/topics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for Ethereum tooling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum ABI signature processing, including recursive tuple handling and string formatting, followed by cryptographic hashing. It relies on a local keccak function, assumed to be a standard cryptographic hash. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is detected. Validation of 'type' is minimal but sufficient. The functions are well-structured and align with Ethereum specifications. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Ethereum ABI signature generation. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The cryptographic operations are standard and safe. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is minimal (~0.1), justified by cryptographic use but not indicative of any threat.",
