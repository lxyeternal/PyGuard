  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating, normalizing, and converting Ethereum addresses in various formats.",
  "sources": "Functions that read input parameters such as address strings, byte sequences, and other data types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data; functions mainly process and validate address formats.",
  "flows": "Input data (address strings, bytes) are validated, normalized, or converted through internal functions without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of cryptographic functions like keccak is standard for address checksum calculations. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides address validation and conversion utilities for Ethereum addresses, including checksum verification and normalization. Regular expressions are used for format validation. Address hashing and checksum creation follow Ethereum standards, utilizing keccak. All operations are standard for address handling. No data leaks, network communication, or malicious behavior are evident. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard address utility library with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs address validation, normalization, and checksum calculations consistent with Ethereum standards. No security risks or malware are detected based on this code alone.",
