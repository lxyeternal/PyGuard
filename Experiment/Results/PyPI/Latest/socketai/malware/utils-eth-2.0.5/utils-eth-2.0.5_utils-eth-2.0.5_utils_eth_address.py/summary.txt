  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Ethereum address utility module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.2), primarily due to cryptographic functions which are standard and safe. The high confidence score (1) reflects the straightforward, well-understood nature of the code."
