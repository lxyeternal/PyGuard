  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception (`ValidationError`) inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - There are no external data sources, sinks, data flows, or executable logic.\n   - The code contains only a docstring and a `pass` statement.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0.\n   - The risk score is also correctly 0, as the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code's explicit content.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign class definition for a custom exception.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive aspects are present.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Given the thorough analysis, I concur with the current scores.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is entirely safe, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
