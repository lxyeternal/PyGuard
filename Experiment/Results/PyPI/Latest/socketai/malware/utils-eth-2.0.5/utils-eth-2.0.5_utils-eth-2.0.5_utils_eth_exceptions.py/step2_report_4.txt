  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception (`ValidationError`) inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no external data sources, no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation.\n   - No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n\n2. **Code Logic and Implementation:**\n   - The code is straightforward: a class with a docstring and a `pass` statement.\n   - It serves a common purpose in Python projects for validation error handling.\n   - No anomalies, unusual constructs, or complex logic are present.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These assessments are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here, as the code is purely definitional.\n   - No risk factors warrant a higher score.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (No malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (Code is straightforward and not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (No security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, no adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe custom exception class with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- Scores are appropriate and justified as zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\nIf I were to assign my own estimates, they would align with the current scores:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms the code's benign status.",
