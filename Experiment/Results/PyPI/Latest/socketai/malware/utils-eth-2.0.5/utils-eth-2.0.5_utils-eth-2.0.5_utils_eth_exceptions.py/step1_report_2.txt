  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class definition only",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points present",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines an exception class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class definition with no complex or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with no additional methods or attributes. It contains only a docstring and a pass statement. No input/output, data processing, or external calls are present. There is no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for creating a specific exception class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a custom exception for validation errors and does not contain any malicious or security-sensitive behavior.",
