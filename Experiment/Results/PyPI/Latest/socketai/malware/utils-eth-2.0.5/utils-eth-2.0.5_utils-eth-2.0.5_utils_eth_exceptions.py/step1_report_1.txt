  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output paths exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class named ValidationError that inherits from Python's Exception class. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose. The class contains no additional methods or attributes, and there are no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The code does not interact with external data, perform I/O operations, or execute any dynamic code. Overall, it appears to be standard, safe, and intended solely for exception handling within a larger program.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, benign custom exception class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions. It is a normal part of many Python projects for handling validation errors.",
