  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definition is static.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; class contains only a docstring and pass statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a simple exception definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal custom exception class with a docstring and pass statement, typical for Python exception handling. No external interactions, data processing, or executable logic are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and standard pattern confirm the absence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
