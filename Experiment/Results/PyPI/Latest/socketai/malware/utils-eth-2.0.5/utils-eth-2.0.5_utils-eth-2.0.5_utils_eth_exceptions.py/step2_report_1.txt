  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a simple class definition for a custom exception, with no data processing, external interactions, or complex logic.\n   - All reports agree that there are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.\n   - The class contains only a docstring and a `pass` statement, which is standard for such exception classes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident; the reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - The conclusion that the code is benign and safe is correct.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all zero, which is justified.\n   - No suspicious or malicious activity is detected or inferred.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on factual observations; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for exception handling.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (No malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (No security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no suspicious features, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity or patterns present                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Code is clear, straightforward, and un-obfuscated             |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious behaviors       |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and typical for its purpose. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
