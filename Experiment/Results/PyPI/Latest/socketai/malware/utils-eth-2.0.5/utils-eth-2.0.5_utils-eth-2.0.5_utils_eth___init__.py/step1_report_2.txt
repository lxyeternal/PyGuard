{
  "purpose": "This code is a module import and setup script for the 'utils-eth' library, organizing imports from various submodules and performing version retrieval and Python 2 deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal submodules, version retrieval via pkg_resources, and Python version check at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; import statements and version retrieval do not handle user input or data.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs module imports, version retrieval, and warnings.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses warnings to alert for deprecated Python 2 support, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports various internal modules and functions, checks Python version to issue warnings about deprecation, and retrieves package version info via pkg_resources. All operations are standard setup procedures for a library package. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malware behaviors are evident. The code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations. It adheres to normal module setup and import patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on its content. The only notable activity is issuing a deprecation warning for Python 2 support, which is typical for ongoing software maintenance.",
