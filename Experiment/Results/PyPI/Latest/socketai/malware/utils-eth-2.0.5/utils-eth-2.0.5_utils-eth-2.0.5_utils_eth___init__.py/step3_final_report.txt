{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization module for the 'utils-eth' Python library, importing various utility functions, constants, and submodules related to Ethereum blockchain data handling. It also performs a Python version check to warn about deprecated Python 2 support and retrieves the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, sys.version_info check, pkg_resources.get_distribution call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports and version retrieval",
  "anomalies": "Only a standard deprecation warning for Python 2; no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that imports internal utility modules, issues a deprecation warning if running on Python 2, and retrieves package version info. It contains no data processing, network activity, or code execution that could be malicious. The structure is transparent and typical for a package's __init__.py or setup module. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code's benign nature is consistent with the absence of any malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard initialization script for an Ethereum utility library, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as such, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
