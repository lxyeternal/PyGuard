  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the presence of any issues, and the appropriateness of their scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Code Content:** The provided code is a straightforward module that imports various internal helper functions, sets a deprecation warning for Python 2, and retrieves the package version.\n- **Behavior:** No data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None. The code appears to be a standard setup/init script for a utility library.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a utility library setup with imports and version retrieval.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks or flows are present.\n- **Anomalies:** Only a deprecation warning for Python 2, which is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Security Risk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, well-reasoned, and reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the import and version check.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** Only the deprecation warning, standard practice.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as an import/setup script.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows involving untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies:** Only the deprecation warning, standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a module import script.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; benign setup code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a package init script.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data or network sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Security Risk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Code Behavior:** The code is purely for importing modules, setting warnings, and fetching version info—nothing malicious, obfuscated, or risky.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n- **Potential Concerns:** No assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities are made; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Recommendation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks identified.\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate. If any future code in this project introduces dynamic behaviors or external interactions, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the code's benign and standard setup nature. No adjustments are needed.",
