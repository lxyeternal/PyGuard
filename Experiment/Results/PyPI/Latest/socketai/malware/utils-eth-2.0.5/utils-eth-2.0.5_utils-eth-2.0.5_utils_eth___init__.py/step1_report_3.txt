{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily importing various utility functions, modules, and constants from a package called 'utils-eth' for use in other parts of the application. It also includes a version check and a deprecation warning for Python 2.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'sys' module (version info), 'warnings' module, and the 'pkg_resources' module to get package version info. It also imports from local modules within the package (e.g., .abi, .address, .applicators, etc.).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data or code execution points such as network connections, file writes, eval/exec calls, or similar. The only operations are imports and a warning message.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing modules and functions, then issuing a deprecation warning if Python 2 is detected, and retrieving the package version. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns. The only noteworthy behavior is the deprecation warning for Python 2, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a set of utility modules and functions, checks Python version, issues a warning if running on Python 2, and retrieves package version info. All imports are from known modules or local package components. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling occurs. The deprecation warning is standard and explicitly intended for informing users about Python version support.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization script for a utility library, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, nor does it contain suspicious or malicious code. The only notable activity is a Python 2 deprecation warning, which is benign.",
