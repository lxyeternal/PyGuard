  "purpose": "Utility functions for data formatting and transformation, including applying formatters to sequences, dicts, and arrays, as well as key mapping and conditional formatting.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (formatters, sequences, dicts, conditions), imported modules (.decorators, .functional, .toolz).",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission; data is processed internally within functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through formatter functions, which are applied at specific indices, conditions, or keys, producing transformed data.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of deprecation warnings is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of data transformation utilities with standard patterns. It accepts external formatter functions, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code itself does not execute or validate these functions maliciously. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The potential security concern arises solely from how the functions are used externally, not from the static code. The code structure is straightforward, with proper exception handling and clear logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data formatting, with no inherent malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of formatter functions supplied by users. Static analysis indicates no malware or obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal, primarily depending on usage context.",
