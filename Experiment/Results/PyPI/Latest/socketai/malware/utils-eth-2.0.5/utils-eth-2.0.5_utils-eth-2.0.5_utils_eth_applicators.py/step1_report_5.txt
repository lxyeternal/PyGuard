{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and individual values, mainly for data processing and formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function inputs such as lists, dictionaries, and values passed to the formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions process and yield transformed data; potential sinks include formatted data outputs and exception raising on errors.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through formatters and transformation functions, with conditional logic and exception handling influencing the flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains deprecated warnings indicating code evolution; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident; no obfuscation features or malicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data transformations with functions applying formatters based on indices, conditions, or key mappings. It uses standard Python features, including generators, warnings, and exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent. The deprecation warning suggests maintenance but does not imply malicious activity. All data processing appears legitimate for data formatting purposes, and no external network calls, file access, or hidden behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data formatting utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It follows standard patterns and includes no external network or system manipulation code. The deprecation warning indicates ongoing maintenance rather than malicious intent.",
