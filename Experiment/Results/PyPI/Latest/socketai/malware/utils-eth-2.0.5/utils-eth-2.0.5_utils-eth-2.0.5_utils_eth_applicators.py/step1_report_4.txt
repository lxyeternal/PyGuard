{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and other data structures, mainly for data processing and formatting tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the function parameters such as lists, dictionaries, and callables, which are used as data inputs for transformations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the places where formatted or transformed data is returned or yielded, such as in generators or return statements. No untrusted data is written to external systems or files within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (like sequences, dictionaries, or callables), through formatter functions and conditionals, to yielded or returned outputs, including possible exception handling for invalid data or key conflicts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. Warnings are about deprecation, not malicious intent. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is detected. No network or system operations are performed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data transformation functions with type annotations, including applying formatters at specific indices, combining multiple formatters, conditionally applying formatters, and mapping dictionary keys. It uses warnings for deprecation notices and employs generators for lazy evaluation. The functions handle typical data processing logic, with some exception handling for invalid data. No external inputs like network or file operations, nor any suspicious or malicious code, are present. The only noteworthy aspect is the deprecation warning indicating upcoming changes in the API usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data transformation utility module with no malicious behavior detected. It performs data formatting tasks securely without external system interaction or suspicious activities. The presence of deprecation warnings suggests ongoing maintenance but does not indicate malicious intent.",
