{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to data structures such as lists and dictionaries, mainly for data processing and formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Data inputs originate from parameters in functions accepting lists, dictionaries, and callables, typically provided by external callers or other modules within the codebase.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include places where untrusted data (e.g., from external sources) could be formatted or transformed, notably in functions applying formatters to data structures. No network or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (lists, dicts, callables) through formatter applications, conditional checks, and transformation generators, with no evident external data exfiltration or malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are detected. The code uses warnings for deprecation and proper exception handling. No suspicious dynamic code execution or external communication is present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple data transformation functions: applying formatters at specific indices, combining formatters, applying formatters conditionally or to entire sequences or dicts, and key remapping. It uses standard Python features like generators, type hints, and decorators. No code injection, external network calls, or data leaks are detected. The use of warnings for deprecation is benign. The error handling is appropriate and does not introduce security risks. The code appears designed solely for data processing with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a set of data processing utilities with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains standard practices for handling data transformations and deprecations without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
