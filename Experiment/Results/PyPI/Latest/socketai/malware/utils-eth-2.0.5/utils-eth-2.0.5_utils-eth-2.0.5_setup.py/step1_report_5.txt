{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'utils-eth', including dependencies and metadata, for distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; static strings for package metadata; package requirements; find_packages function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data is used at runtime; no data flow from external sources to critical sinks.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows involving untrusted inputs; static dependencies and metadata are used for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code follows standard package setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It reads the README file for long description, defines dependencies for various development stages, and calls setup() with package metadata and configuration. No external inputs are processed dynamically, and no suspicious code constructs are present. All dependencies are version-restricted and intended for package building and testing, with no indication of malicious intent. The code does not contain any code injection, data leakage, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The dependencies and structure follow best practices for package distribution.",
