{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package named 'utils-eth' with specified dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, dependencies listed in install_requires and extras_require, and package metadata from setup().",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external communication; the script primarily manages package configuration and metadata.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content to assign to long_description; loads dependencies; calls setup() with package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file, defines dependencies for various development tasks, and configures package metadata. No external data inputs are processed dynamically at runtime beyond static file reading. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior are evident. The dependencies listed are common and do not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is straightforward and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for Python package distribution.",
