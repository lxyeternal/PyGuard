{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script (`setup.py`) for the 'utils-eth' library, defining dependencies, metadata, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static dependency declarations; uses 'find_packages()' for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external data flows or network communication.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. Dependencies are well-known and version-restricted. No obfuscation or external data processing is present. The script reads a static README file and configures package metadata. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code follows best practices for Python packaging and contains no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security issues. All signals indicate a safe package configuration with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
