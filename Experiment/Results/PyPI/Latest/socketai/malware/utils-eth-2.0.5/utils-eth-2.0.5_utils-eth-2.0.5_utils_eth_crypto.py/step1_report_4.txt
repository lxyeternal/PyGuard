  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function for computing the keccak hash of various input types.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text",
  "sinks": "The keccak_256 function, which outputs the hash bytes",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> to_bytes conversion -> keccak_256 hash computation",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that converts various input types into bytes using an external conversion function, then hashes the result with keccak_256. It imports and uses a well-known hashing library from 'eth_hash.auto', which is standard for Ethereum-related cryptography. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The conversion function 'to_bytes' is external and assumed to be safe; without its implementation, no concerns arise here. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for hashing data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard utility function for hashing data using keccak, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It relies on a reputable hashing library and performs typical data conversion and hashing operations.",
