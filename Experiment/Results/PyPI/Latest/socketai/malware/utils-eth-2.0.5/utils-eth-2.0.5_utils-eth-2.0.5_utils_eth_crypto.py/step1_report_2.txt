  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function for keccak hashing using eth_hash.auto.keccak_256, converting various input types to bytes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive (bytes, int, bool), hexstr (str), text (str). These are data inputs for hashing.",
  "sinks": "Calls to keccak_256, which processes the data and returns hash bytes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are converted to bytes via to_bytes, then passed to keccak_256 for hashing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code relies on external conversion and hashing libraries. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple wrapper function that converts various input types into bytes using to_bytes, then hashes the result with keccak_256. The source inputs are typical for hashing functions. The flow from input to hash is straightforward and secure, assuming to_bytes is safe and properly implemented. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code appears to serve a legitimate cryptographic purpose without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe for use in applications requiring keccak hashing.",
