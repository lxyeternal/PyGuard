{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function for computing keccak-256 hash from various input types.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text.",
  "sinks": "Call to keccak_256, which computes and returns the hash.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are converted to bytes via to_bytes, then passed to keccak_256 to produce hash.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. Usage of cryptographic hashing is standard.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts multiple input types (bytes, int, bool, hex string, text) and uses a helper to convert these to bytes before hashing. The cryptographic function imported (keccak_256) is from a reputable library (eth_hash), used for hashing. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage. The code appears to be a straightforward hash wrapper, typical in blockchain or cryptography contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic hash function wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appropriately converts various input types to bytes and computes the keccak-256 hash.",
