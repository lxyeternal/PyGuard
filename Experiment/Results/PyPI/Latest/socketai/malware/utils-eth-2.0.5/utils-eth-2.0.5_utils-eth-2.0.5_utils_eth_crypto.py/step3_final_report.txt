  "purpose": "A cryptographic utility function that converts various input types to bytes and hashes them using keccak_256.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'primitive', 'hexstr', 'text' and the 'to_bytes' function for data conversion.",
  "sinks": "The 'keccak_256' hashing function, which outputs hashed bytes; no data leaks or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> 'to_bytes' conversion -> 'keccak_256' hashing -> output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard libraries. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple wrapper around a reputable keccak hashing function, converting various input types to bytes via 'to_bytes' and hashing them. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The reliance on external 'to_bytes' is a potential concern if insecure, but assumed safe. The code's structure and dependencies are standard, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure cryptographic utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
