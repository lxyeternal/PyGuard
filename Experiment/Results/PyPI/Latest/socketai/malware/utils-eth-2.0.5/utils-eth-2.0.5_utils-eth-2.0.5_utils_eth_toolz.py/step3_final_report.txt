  "purpose": "Conditional import of utility functions from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' for compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' modules.",
  "sinks": "None; only import statements, no data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Imports executed at module load; no data flow beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a large set of functions from 'cytoolz' with a fallback to 'toolz'. This pattern is common for maintaining compatibility across environments. No execution beyond imports occurs, and no suspicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation is present. The extensive import list is typical for utility modules and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility layer for utility functions. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The small security risk scores assigned in some reports are justified by the large import list but do not reflect actual threats. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
