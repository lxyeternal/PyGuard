  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility layer for utility functions. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The small security risk scores assigned in some reports are justified by the large import list but do not reflect actual threats. Overall, the code is safe and standard."
