  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code behavior, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, conditional import pattern from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz'.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- The only notable aspect is the large number of functions imported, which could be part of a utility-heavy codebase but isn't inherently suspicious.\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Summary:**\n- Benign, standard import pattern.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Fully aligned with the code's behavior.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the fallback import pattern.\n- No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with the code.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Summary:**\n- Slightly more verbose, notes the large import list.\n- Still, no signs of malicious intent.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9) but still high.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (very low, perhaps considering the large import list as a minimal risk, but not malicious)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious behavior.\n- The small security risk score (0.1) is acceptable, given the large import list, but it does not indicate actual malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Summary:**\n- Reiterates the import pattern.\n- No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- Similar confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 (acceptable)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Consistent with the code.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Summary:**\n- Same as others, emphasizes the import pattern.\n- No malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (correct)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Fully aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the extensive import list, a slight security concern could be considered, but since these are utility functions and there's no evidence of malicious intent, a very low score (0.0 to 0.1) is justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very low, mainly due to the large import list, but not suspicious)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The import pattern is standard, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores are appropriate, though a tiny security risk score (around 0.05) could be considered, but 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are reasonable and should remain as is.",
