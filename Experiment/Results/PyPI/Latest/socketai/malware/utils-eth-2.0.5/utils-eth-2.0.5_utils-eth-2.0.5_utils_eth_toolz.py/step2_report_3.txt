  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code pattern: conditional import of functions from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz'.\n- No actual execution beyond imports.\n- No data flow, network activity, or suspicious operations.\n- The code is a common pattern for maintaining compatibility with different environments.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Benign, standard import pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's benign nature. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the fallback mechanism, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Large import list, fallback mechanism, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Analysis of scores:**\n  - The securityRisk score is 0.1, which is low but non-zero. Given the code's nature, this might be slightly overestimating the risk, as the code only imports utility functions.\n  - Malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated is 0, correct.\n- **Recommendation:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0, as there's no evident risk. The extensive import list alone isn't suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard import with fallback.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Same as above. The securityRisk score could be reduced to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.95\n- **Assessment:** Correct, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **General Recommendations:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, which is correct.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The only point of contention is the securityRisk score in reports 3 and 4, which is set at 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and benign intent, this should be lowered to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n- The code is a standard compatibility pattern for importing utility functions.\n- No suspicious data flows, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The extensive import list does not indicate malicious intent.\n- No security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores for the Entire Code:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk | Confidence |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|------------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0**           | **0.95** |\n\nThis reflects the benign nature of the code, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The only adjustment needed is to set the security risk score to zero, given the code's harmless import pattern.",
