{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a comprehensive set of functions from either the 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' library, which are utility libraries for functional programming in Python.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the import statements, which load functions from external packages 'cytoolz' or 'toolz'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks or operations on untrusted data; the code only imports functions without executing them.",
  "flows": "No data flow or function invocation occurs in the provided snippet; only imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to import a large list of functions from external libraries, switching between 'cytoolz' and 'toolz' depending on availability, which is a common practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to conditionally import multiple functions from two similar external libraries, ensuring compatibility across different environments. There is no evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, data theft, or network activity. The imports are from well-known utility libraries, and no suspicious operations are performed after the imports. The structure is straightforward, with clear exception handling for missing modules. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign attempt to import utility functions from either 'cytoolz' or 'toolz'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for maintaining compatibility with different package versions.",
