{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import various functions from the 'cytoolz' library, and if that fails, it imports the same functions from the 'toolz' library. The purpose appears to be to provide a set of functional programming utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the Python environment's installed packages ('cytoolz' or 'toolz') during import statements.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include data sinks that send untrusted data elsewhere or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The source data (imported libraries) flow into the local namespace as functions, but there are no further data flows or executions of untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs conditional import to fallback from 'cytoolz' to 'toolz'. This is a common pattern and not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual runtime behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard import pattern for attempting to import an optimized or C-extension version of a library ('cytoolz') and fallback to a pure Python version ('toolz') if unavailable. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The functions imported are purely utility functions used in functional programming paradigms, and their use is not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a compatibility layer for importing utility functions. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe import pattern.",
