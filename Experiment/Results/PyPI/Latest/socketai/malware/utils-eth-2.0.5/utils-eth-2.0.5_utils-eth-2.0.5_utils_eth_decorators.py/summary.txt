  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through embedded network requests that transmit sensitive data to an external IP address. This activity indicates high potential for data theft or remote monitoring. The scores in the reports are appropriate, though slightly conservative in some cases. The core issue should be flagged as malicious activity, and the code should be reviewed or removed to prevent data leakage."
