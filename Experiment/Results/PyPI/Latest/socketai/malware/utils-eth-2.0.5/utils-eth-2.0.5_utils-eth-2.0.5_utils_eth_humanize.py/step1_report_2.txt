{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for humanizing durations, byte sequences, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for display or formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Functions that read and process input data include humanize_seconds (input: seconds), humanize_bytes (input: bytes), humanize_hash (input: Hash32), humanize_ipfs_uri (input: URI), and humanize_integer_sequence (input: iterable of ints).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are string formatting operations where data is output as formatted strings, such as in humanize_bytes, humanize_hash, humanize_ipfs_uri, and humanize_range, but these do not pose security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables into processing functions, with minimal transformation, ultimately returning human-readable strings. There are no external data dependencies or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. Functions like humanize_ipfs_uri correctly validate input URLs, and there are no signs of obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides formatting utilities for durations, byte sequences, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, with clear, well-structured functions. Input validation is performed in is_ipfs_uri, ensuring the URI scheme and CID format. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious data handling observed. All operations are safe and intended for display or formatting purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely utility functions for formatting and humanization, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs input validation where appropriate and does not contain any evident malicious or suspicious code segments.",
