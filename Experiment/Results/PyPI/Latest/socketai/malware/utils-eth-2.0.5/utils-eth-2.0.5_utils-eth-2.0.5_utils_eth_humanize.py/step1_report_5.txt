  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable formatting of seconds, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant values, input parameters for functions, and URL parsing results.",
  "sinks": "None identified where untrusted data directly influences system or external resources. No network, file, or sensitive data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URI, bytes, integers) flows through validation, parsing, and formatting functions, without unsafe data handling or external side-effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. No backdoors or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of formatting utilities that process input data for display purposes. It performs validation (e.g., IPFS URI validation), parsing (URL parsing for IPFS), and formatting (human-readable durations, byte hashes, IPFS hashes, integer sequences). No external network or system modifications are performed, and all data handling appears safe and straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious injections.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on provided input data, performing validation and formatting without unsafe operations. Therefore, the overall security risk is very low.",
