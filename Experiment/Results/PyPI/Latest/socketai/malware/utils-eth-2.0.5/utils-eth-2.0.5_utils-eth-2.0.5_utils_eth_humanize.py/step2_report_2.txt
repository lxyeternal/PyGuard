  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical flaws, scoring appropriateness, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No issues, benign utility functions, no malicious behavior, code is safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified given the benign nature.\n- **Comments:** The report is thorough, and the code indeed appears safe. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for formatting data; no external data sources or malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal concern for potential vulnerabilities.\n- **Comments:** The only slight concern might be the exception raised in `humanize_ipfs_uri` if an invalid URI is provided. However, this is a controlled validation and not a security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring seems reasonable; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; utility functions, no external interactions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — still very low, justified for a purely formatting utility.\n- **Comments:** No issues detected; the validation in `is_ipfs_uri` is straightforward.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with input validation, no external system interactions, safe code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — justified, given the limited validation and exception handling.\n- **Comments:** The exception in `humanize_ipfs_uri` is controlled and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions, no external side-effects, safe data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, and the scores reflect that.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, justified by the nature of the functions.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Confirmed as 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Remain at or below 0.2, as the functions are utility-based and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, primarily related to input validation, which is appropriate and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
