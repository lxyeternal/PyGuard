{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for humanizing and formatting data such as seconds, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (e.g., seconds, bytes, URIs, integer sequences). It does not read external input sources or files directly.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings; it does not write to external systems, make network requests, or perform actions with untrusted data beyond formatting.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., seconds, bytes, URIs, integers) is processed through formatting functions to produce human-readable strings; no untrusted data is used in security-sensitive operations or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. No dynamic code execution, external code invocation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises purely utility functions for data formatting and representation. It performs standard parsing, slicing, and string operations. No security-sensitive operations or external interactions are present. Functions like humanize_ipfs_uri validate URIs against specific schemes and hash formats, but do not perform malicious actions. The IPFS URI validation checks CIDv0 format, and no external network or system calls occur. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for formatting data into human-readable forms. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use in larger projects, provided the inputs are from trusted sources. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
