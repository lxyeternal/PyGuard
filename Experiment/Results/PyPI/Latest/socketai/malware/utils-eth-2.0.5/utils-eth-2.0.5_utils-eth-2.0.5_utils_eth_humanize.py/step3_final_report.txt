  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, with validation for IPFS CIDv0 hashes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as bytes, Hash32, URI strings, and integer sequences; parsing of URI components.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to external systems or sensitive operations; validation occurs locally.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and formatted; no external data flows or system calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "Standard validation in 'humanize_ipfs_uri' raises exceptions on invalid input; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility functions with pattern validation, formatting, and iteration logic. No network calls, external dependencies, or dynamic code execution are present. Validation steps, such as CIDv0 hash checks, are standard and safe. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The exception handling in 'humanize_ipfs_uri' is standard input validation. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and performs no security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, utility functions with proper validation and formatting. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, justified by validation steps but not indicating any real threat.",
