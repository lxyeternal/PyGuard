{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for human-readable formatting of time durations, byte sequences, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "No input sources, data is processed from function arguments like bytes, strings, or integers.",
  "sinks": "None; functions generate formatted strings or iterate over data; no data leaks or untrusted sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions operate solely on their parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; functions are straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data formatting and parsing, including humanizing seconds, bytes, hashes, and IPFS URIs, as well as processing integer sequences. There are no network calls, file operations, or external data dependencies. The only notable operations are string manipulations, parsing, and iteration over data structures, all of which are benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears safe and designed for formatting and parsing utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of formatting and parsing utilities with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe for use within larger projects. No vulnerabilities or malware-like activities are present.",
