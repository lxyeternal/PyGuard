{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for humanizing durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for display and formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function arguments such as seconds (numeric), bytes, hash values, URIs, and integer sequences. These inputs are typically passed directly to functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points are minimal; the code primarily performs formatting and parsing. No output directly involves untrusted data affecting system state or external systems. The only potential concern is the raise in 'humanize_ipfs_uri' if an invalid URI is provided, which is a controlled exception, not a security vulnerability.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function inputs (seconds, bytes, URIs, integers) through processing functions, and then outputs formatted human-readable strings. No external network or file system interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. No obfuscation, malicious injections, or unusual behavior are observed. All functions perform predictable formatting or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for human-readable formatting, URI parsing, and sequence processing. It performs input validation (e.g., IPFS URI format), string slicing for hash abbreviations, and sequence range calculations. There are no code injection points, no dynamic execution, nor external system interactions. The URI validation is limited to format checks and CIDv0 pattern recognition, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The exception handling in 'humanize_ipfs_uri' is appropriate and does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of formatting and validation utilities with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations such as string manipulation, sequence processing, and validation checks. No vulnerabilities or malware indications are present.",
