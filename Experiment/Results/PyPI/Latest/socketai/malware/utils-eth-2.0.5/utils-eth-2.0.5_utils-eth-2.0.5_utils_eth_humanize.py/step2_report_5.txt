  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is utility functions for formatting durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations are involved.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** The report assigns a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code. Security risk is also 0, consistent with the straightforward, benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues detected. The functions are safe, well-structured, and perform simple parsing and formatting.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing input validation (e.g., IPFS URI validation) and safe string manipulations. No external dependencies or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.1, reflecting minimal concern about the URI validation step, but overall negligible.\n- **Assessment:** The validation in `is_ipfs_uri` and `humanize_ipfs_uri` is appropriate and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The logic is sound, and no malicious activity is implied.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, utility functions for formatting data. No external data, network activity, or code execution. Validation steps are in place for IPFS URIs.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.2, slightly higher but still very low, possibly due to the raise in exception for invalid URIs.\n- **Assessment:** The exception handling is standard and does not pose a security risk. The code is safe and predictable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with validation (e.g., CIDv0 check) and formatting. No external calls or sensitive operations.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.1, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The validation logic is correct and does not introduce vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as others—pure formatting and validation functions, no external interactions or malicious code.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Malware score is 0; security risk is 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues detected; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify any actual issues in the code. All functions perform safe, standard operations.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated & Security Risk Scores:** Both are very low or zero, aligning with the straightforward utility functions.\n- **Claims Based on Assumptions:** No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent; all reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely utility functions for formatting and parsing.\n- Validation steps (e.g., IPFS URI validation, CID checks) are standard and safe.\n- No external network or file operations, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The functions do not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to security issues beyond standard validation.\n\n### **Overall Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (Confirmed safe)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (No obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (No security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its utility purpose. No adjustments needed to the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign and secure nature.",
