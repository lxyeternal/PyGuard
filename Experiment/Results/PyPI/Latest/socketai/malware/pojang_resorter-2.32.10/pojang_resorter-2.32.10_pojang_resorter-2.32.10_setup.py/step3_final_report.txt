  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires' and package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or runtime data flows; setup script is static.",
  "flows": "N/A - static setup configuration, no data flows or runtime execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with clear and standard structure. Dependencies are common libraries for automation, GUI, networking, and multimedia. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 to 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the setup script. Potential runtime misuse of dependencies is outside the scope of setup code and does not impact the malware score. The minimal security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified considering dependencies could be exploited during runtime, but the setup code itself remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is legitimate, straightforward, and free of malicious code or obfuscation. The slight security risk scores reflect potential runtime misuse of dependencies, not the setup code itself. Overall, the package is safe, and the reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
