{
  "purpose": "Provides basic metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports a main function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static imports and metadata are used.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines package metadata and imports a main function from a local module. There are no functions, no data processing, no environment variable access, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The absence of any input handling or secret management indicates no suspicious behavior or malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard package initialization fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It mainly sets package metadata and imports functionality from a local module, which by itself poses no risk.",
