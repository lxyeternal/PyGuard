  "purpose": "Minimal package descriptor setting metadata and importing main functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, setting __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no external communication.",
  "flows": "Import from local module, setting metadata variables; no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initializer with no dynamic code, input/output, or network activity. It imports a local module and sets metadata, which is typical and benign. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
