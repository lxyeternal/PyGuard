  "purpose": "Provides basic metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are minimal; the code only imports and assigns metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initialization script that sets metadata such as version and author, and imports the main function. It does not contain any logic, input handling, network operations, or security-sensitive code. The import is from a local module, which is typical and not suspicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package initializer with no malicious or security risks detected.",
