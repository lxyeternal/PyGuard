  "purpose": "Defines metadata and imports the main module for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'main' function from a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows observed; the code only imports and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module-level metadata and a single import statement. No user input handling, network communication, or data processing occurs here. The import from a relative module is typical in package structures. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present. The metadata (version and author) are standard and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward package descriptor with a standard import. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
