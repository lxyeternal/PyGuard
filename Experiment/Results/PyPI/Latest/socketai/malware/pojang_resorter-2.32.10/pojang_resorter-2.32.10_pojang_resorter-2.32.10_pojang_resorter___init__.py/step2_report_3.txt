  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward package descriptor that imports a main function from a local module (.main).\n- No data processing, user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The code is minimal, typical for package initialization, and appears benign.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The actual code provided matches the reports: it imports `main` from `.main`, sets `__version__` and `__author__`, and contains no other logic.\n- No issues are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n**Error or Flaws in the Reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the code being straightforward and readable.\n- `securityRisk` scores are 0, which aligns with the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Since the code is minimal, if this is part of a larger package, the main module (`.main`) could contain risks, but based solely on this snippet, there are no issues.\n- The reports do not suggest any assumptions about hidden malicious code; they correctly conclude the code is safe.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a simple package initializer, with no malicious activity or security issues.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature.",
