  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool for Pojang Resorter with version and author metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports main from a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, external network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a package's purpose and metadata, imports a main module, and sets version and author info. There are no input/output operations, network activities, or suspicious constructs. The import statement is relative and standard, not indicative of malicious intent. The overall structure is typical for a package initializer file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module metadata and entry point setup. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
