  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issue presence:** The code is a minimal package descriptor with a single import and metadata. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is 0, which is reasonable. No need to adjust scores.  \n- **Justification for risk scores:** Since the code is purely metadata and import statements, the risk is negligible.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no issues detected.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is consistent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity or code behavior.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no issues detected.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.  \n- **Justification:** No dynamic or malicious code present.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no issues detected.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** The code is a standard package initializer.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, no issues detected.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores of 0 are justified.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious or malicious patterns, a risk score of 0 is appropriate across all reports.  \n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.  \n- No adjustments needed.  \n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at **0** for all reports.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence that the code is a benign package descriptor with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
