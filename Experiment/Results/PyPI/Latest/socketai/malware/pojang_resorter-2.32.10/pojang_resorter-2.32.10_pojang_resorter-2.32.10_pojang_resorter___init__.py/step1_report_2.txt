  "purpose": "Provides a module for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, primarily setting version and author information.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.main' and assigns metadata variables (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing, network calls, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks suspicious constructs or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a local module, sets package metadata such as version and author. There are no runtime data inputs, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any indication of malicious behavior. The simplicity and clarity of the code suggest it is a standard package initialization module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines metadata and imports the main functionality of the CLI tool without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
