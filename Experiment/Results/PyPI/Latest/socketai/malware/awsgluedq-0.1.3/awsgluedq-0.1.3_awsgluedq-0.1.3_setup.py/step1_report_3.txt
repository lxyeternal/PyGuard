{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that performs a network request during installation and executes a post-installation step involving an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data through the requests.get() call at the beginning and within the post_install() function, which makes an HTTP GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver'.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() calls send data over the network to an external server. These requests could potentially leak information or be used for tracking.",
  "flows": "The initial requests.get() executes during script import, potentially sending data to the external server. The post_install() method, invoked after installation, also makes an external request, possibly revealing installation details or environment info.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes repeated external requests to a suspicious domain 'pov.sh' on port 45111 during package setup and post-install, which is unusual for standard package metadata or setup scripts. No other malicious code or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports common modules and then performs an external HTTP GET request immediately upon import, which is atypical for setup scripts and may indicate tracking or data exfiltration. A custom install command class runs the standard installation process and then performs an additional network request. This behavior can be used for malicious purposes such as identifying environments, tracking installations, or exfiltrating information. The code does not contain obfuscation or hidden code, but the external requests to a suspicious domain are concerning. The code does not perform any malicious actions beyond these requests but could be used maliciously to send data externally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is performing external network requests during installation, which could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or malicious command-and-control communication. While there is no explicit malicious action like data theft or system damage, the external communication to an obscure server is suspicious and warrants caution.",
