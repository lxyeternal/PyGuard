  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through repeated external requests to an obscure server during import and installation, indicating potential covert tracking or malicious command-and-control activity. While no explicit malicious payloads are detected, the behavior's nature warrants a high security risk assessment and a malware score reflecting significant suspicion."
