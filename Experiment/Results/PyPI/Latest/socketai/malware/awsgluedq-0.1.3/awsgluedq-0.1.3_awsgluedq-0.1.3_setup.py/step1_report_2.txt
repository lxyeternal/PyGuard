{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that installs dependencies and executes a network request during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; makes HTTP GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver' during module load and during post-install.",
  "sinks": "The network request made to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver' potentially transmits or receives data, possibly exfiltrating information or communicating with a command-and-control server.",
  "flows": "Upon import, requests.get is called, sending a request to the specified URL; during installation, the custom PostInstallCommand runs post_install(), which again makes the same request.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated request to an external, suspicious URL during import and post-install; the URL 'pov.sh:45111' is uncommon and potentially malicious; the code does not handle the response; no validation or use of returned data.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with dependencies, but it also includes a network call to an external server both during module load and after installation. The URL used is unusual and may be malicious or used for command-and-control communication. The code does not process or validate the server response, indicating potential data exfiltration or remote control. There are no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code, but the repeated external call and lack of purpose for this request are suspicious. The malicious activity primarily hinges on the external request to an obscure server, which could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform normal package setup tasks but includes suspicious network activity to an unusual external URL both at import time and during installation, indicating potential malicious intent or data exfiltration. Due to the suspicious URL and repeated network requests, this package should be reviewed further before use.",
