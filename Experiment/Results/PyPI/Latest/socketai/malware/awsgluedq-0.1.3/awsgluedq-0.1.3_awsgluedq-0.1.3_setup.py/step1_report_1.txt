{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package with a custom post-installation action that makes an HTTP request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver' is requested twice, once at the module import level and once within the post_install() function.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP GET requests send data to an external server, which could potentially be used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code executes the GET request at import time, and again during the installation process via the custom install command.",
  "anomalies": "The repeated requests to an external server during both import and install are unusual for typical package setup scripts. The server URL is obscure and could be used to monitor or track installations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and the 'requests' library, then performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL immediately upon import. A custom install command class is defined to execute this request again during package installation. The setup configuration overrides the default install command to include this behavior. This pattern indicates potential tracking or malicious data collection, as the URL does not seem related to package functionality. No other malicious code, such as backdoors, data theft, or system manipulation, is present. The repeated external requests during both import and install stages are suspicious and may serve to monitor usage or collect system info covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by making external HTTP requests during import and installation, likely for tracking or monitoring purposes. There is no evidence of malicious payloads such as system damage or data theft, but the behavior warrants caution due to its covert nature and connection to an obscure domain.",
