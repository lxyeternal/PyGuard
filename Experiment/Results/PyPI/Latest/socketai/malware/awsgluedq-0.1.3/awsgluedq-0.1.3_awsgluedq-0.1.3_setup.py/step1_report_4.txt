{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom install command that performs an HTTP GET request to a specific external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; makes an HTTP GET request to http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver during import and in post-install.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call to the external URL can send data or trigger network activity; the response is not processed but the request is made.",
  "flows": "During module import, requests.get is called; during installation, post_install executes and calls requests.get again, establishing outbound network connections.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant network request to a suspicious domain; no validation or handling of response; no apparent legitimate purpose for these requests; hardcoded URL; no user consent or configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party 'requests'. It makes an external HTTP GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/ver' both at import time and after installation. This could be used to identify the presence of the package or to track installations, which is suspicious. The requests are made without validating responses or performing any operation with the data, indicating potential data exfiltration or covert tracking. The setup overrides the install command to execute code that performs network activity during package installation, which is considered malicious or maliciously suspicious behavior in supply chain security contexts. The domain and URL seem suspicious and could be part of a malicious tracking or command-and-control server.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs external network requests to a suspicious domain during import and installation without any clear purpose or user consent, indicating potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. This behavior could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or command-and-control activities.",
