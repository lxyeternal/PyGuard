      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through repeated external requests to an obscure server during import and installation, indicating potential covert tracking or malicious command-and-control activity. While no explicit malicious payloads are detected, the behavior's nature warrants a high security risk assessment and a malware score reflecting significant suspicion."

      "conclusion": "The code is simple and not inherently malicious but exhibits behaviors (external request to suspicious URL, no validation) that raise significant security concerns. It should be treated as potentially malicious with a malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score of about 0.65. Further investigation into the endpoint and context is recommended."
