{
  "purpose": "Initialize the Python package by importing 'test_function' from the sibling module 'module1' and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .module1 import test_function' reads the 'test_function' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks involving untrusted data, external communication, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'test_function'; there are no data flows leading to any sinks, external or internal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity is present. The code aligns with typical package initialization patterns, and there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package initializer with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
