  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initialization file that imports a test function from a sibling module and exposes it via __all__. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or any suspicious behavior. It serves as a standard __init__.py pattern in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard boilerplate for package initialization with no malicious intent or security risks.",
