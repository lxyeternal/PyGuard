  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious logic observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py file that imports a specific function from a sibling module and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns.",
