  "purpose": "Initialize the tests package and expose 'test_function' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .module1 import test_function",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import from relative module, exposing 'test_function' via __all__ for testing purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and conventional for Python package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific function from a relative module, which is standard in Python package development. The __all__ variable specifies the public API of the module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or unusual code constructs. No external data, environment variables, or system calls are involved. The code is minimal, simple, and typical for a package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
