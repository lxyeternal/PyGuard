  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\nThe provided code is a standard Python `__init__.py` file that imports a function from a sibling module and exposes it via `__all__`. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for package initialization.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Initialize test package, expose `test_function`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is standard, with no malicious intent.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n#### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Initialize package namespace, import `test_function`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that this is a typical import pattern with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n#### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Initialize package, expose `test_function`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious behavior or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n#### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Initialize package, expose `test_function`.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately describes the code as boilerplate, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n#### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Initialize package, expose `test_function`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states the code is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of security concerns.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, benign package initialization file with no security issues. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** The scores and analysis align perfectly with the code's nature.",
