{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static string, serving as a benign test or placeholder.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data sources, or environment variables; static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; no untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "None; the function returns a constant string directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic function with no inputs, outputs, dependencies, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious features are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's clarity and lack of external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, posing no security threat or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
