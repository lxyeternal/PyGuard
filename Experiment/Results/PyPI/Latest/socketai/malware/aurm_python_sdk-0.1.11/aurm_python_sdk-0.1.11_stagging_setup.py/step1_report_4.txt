{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'aurm-python-sdk' and modify user environment files by fetching and executing external code during installation.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen to fetch data from an external URL; open() calls to read/write user environment files (~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.fleetwood.py).",
  "sinks": "Writing fetched data into ~/.fleetwood.py; appending commands to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile; executing downloaded script via 'python3 ~/.fleetwood.py' if added to environment files.",
  "flows": "Fetches data from external URL -> Writes to ~/.fleetwood.py -> Appends command to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile -> User environment executes 'python3 ~/.fleetwood.py' upon shell startup.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and saves external data into a hidden file and configures environment files to execute this code automatically, which could be malicious. The external URL is hardcoded, and no validation or authentication is performed on the downloaded content.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom installation command that fetches data from a remote URL and saves it as ~/.fleetwood.py. It then attempts to add a command to run this script to user shell configuration files (~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile). The content fetched and executed is controlled by an external server, with no validation or integrity checks, creating a potential attack vector. This pattern resembles a supply chain attack, as malicious code can be delivered and executed during package installation. The code also silently suppresses exceptions, masking errors that could indicate malicious activity or misconfiguration. The overall behavior indicates an intentional backdoor mechanism that executes remote code on user systems during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious pattern: it downloads external code and configures the user environment to execute it automatically, which can lead to remote code execution and system compromise. This constitutes a supply chain security risk and potential malware behavior.",
