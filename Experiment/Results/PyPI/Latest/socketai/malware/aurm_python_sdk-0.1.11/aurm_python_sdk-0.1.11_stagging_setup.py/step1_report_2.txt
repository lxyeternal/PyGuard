  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to fetch remote data and modify user shell configuration files.",
  "sources": "URL 'https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb' for downloading content.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '~/.fleetwood.py', '~/.zshrc', and '~/.bash_profile' files on the user's system.",
  "flows": "Fetch data from remote URL -> write to ~/.fleetwood.py -> append command to shell config files.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes remote content without verification, writes potentially malicious commands into user shell files, and suppresses exceptions silently. It uses network access during install, which is unusual for typical package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that downloads a remote file from a specified URL. It saves the content into a hidden file in the user's home directory, then appends a command to run that script into common shell configuration files. The code does not validate the fetched content, nor does it prompt the user. Silent exception handling could hide errors. The behavior resembles a backdoor or persistence mechanism, potentially allowing remote code execution or data exfiltration if the remote URL serves malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by fetching remote data during installation and modifying user shell files to execute that data, potentially enabling persistent remote code execution. These actions are indicative of malicious intent or backdoor functionality, making this package highly risky to install.",
