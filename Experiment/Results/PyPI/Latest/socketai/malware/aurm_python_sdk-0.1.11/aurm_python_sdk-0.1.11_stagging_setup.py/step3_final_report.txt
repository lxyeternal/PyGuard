  "purpose": "The code fetches remote data during installation, writes it to a local file, and appends a command to user shell configuration files to execute this remote code at shell startup, enabling persistent remote code execution.",
  "sources": "urllib.request.urlopen() fetching data from external URL; reading from response; writing to '~/.fleetwood.py'; reading and writing to '~/.zshrc' and '~/.bash_profile'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'python3 ~/.fleetwood.py' via shell startup scripts; remote code execution; modification of user environment files.",
  "flows": "urllib.request.urlopen() retrieves remote code -> code writes to '~/.fleetwood.py' -> appends 'python3 ~/.fleetwood.py' command to shell configs -> shell executes remote code at startup.",
  "anomalies": "Silent broad exception handling suppresses errors; no validation or checksum of fetched content; hardcoded URL; persistent setup for remote code execution without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a remote fetch of potentially malicious code during installation, writes it to a hidden file, and appends commands to user shell configuration files to execute this code automatically at startup. Exception handling is broad, hiding errors, and no validation is performed on the fetched content, increasing risk. The pattern indicates a supply chain attack vector or backdoor. All reports correctly identify this behavior, assigning high malware and security risk scores. The code's straightforward nature and persistent setup confirm malicious intent. Scores should be at maximum levels: malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 1.0.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits highly malicious behavior, acting as a persistent backdoor through remote code fetch and execution. All reports accurately identify this pattern. To reflect the severity, the malware score should be 1.0, the obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score 1.0.",
