  "purpose": "Import and execute a function 'a' from a local module '.csjkdc'",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a local module '.csjkdc'",
  "sinks": "Execution of function 'a()' which could potentially perform any action",
  "flows": "Import '.csjkdc' -> call 'a()'",
  "anomalies": "Use of a potentially obfuscated or non-standard module name '.csjkdc', which may be intended to hide malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'a' from a module named '.csjkdc' and executes it immediately. The module name appears obfuscated or non-descriptive, which can be a sign of malicious intent. Without the source code of '.csjkdc', it's unclear what 'a()' does, making this potentially dangerous. The code is minimal but contains suspicious elements due to the obscure module name and direct execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code's simplicity and obscure module name suggest a potential security concern. The immediate execution of 'a()' could lead to malicious behavior depending on the contents of '.csjkdc'. Further inspection of the module is necessary to confirm safety.",
