{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function 'a' from a local module 'csjkdc' and immediately executes it, likely to run hidden or obfuscated code.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .csjkdc, execution of 'a()'",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'a()' which could perform any action depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import 'a' from 'csjkdc' -> call 'a()' immediately after import",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated module name 'csjkdc', immediate invocation of 'a()' without context, no visible implementation details",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing and executing a function from an obfuscated module. The module name 'csjkdc' is non-descriptive, raising suspicion. Without inspecting 'a()', behavior cannot be determined. The pattern of immediate execution from an obfuscated source is common in malicious scripts, but not definitive. Scores are assigned cautiously, with high obfuscation suspicion but low evidence of malicious activity. Further static or dynamic analysis of 'csjkdc' is recommended before execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern suggests potential obfuscation and possible malicious intent, but lacks concrete evidence. The high obfuscation score is justified, while malware and risk scores remain low but warrant caution. Further inspection of the 'csjkdc' module is necessary to confirm safety.",
