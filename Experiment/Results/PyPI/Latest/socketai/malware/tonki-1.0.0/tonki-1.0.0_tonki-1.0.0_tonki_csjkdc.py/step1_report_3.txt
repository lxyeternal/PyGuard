  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them as a message via Telegram API.",
  "sources": "User input through input() function for seed phrases.",
  "targets": "The Telegram API endpoint for sending messages, which receives the seed phrases as payload.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> stored in secret_words -> concatenated into message -> sent to Telegram API endpoint via requests.post().",
  "anomalies": "The code sends sensitive seed phrases directly to a third-party messaging service, which is highly insecure. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded. There is no validation or encryption of seed phrases before transmission. No authentication or authorization checks are in place.",
  "analysis": "The script prompts the user to input 12 seed words, which are then concatenated into a message string. This message is sent to a Telegram chat using a bot API, with the bot token and chat ID embedded directly in the code. The seed phrases are sent in plain text without encryption or obfuscation, representing a major security risk. Hardcoded credentials and the direct transmission of sensitive data suggest malicious intent, especially if this code were used in an unintended context. The code does not perform any validation or sanitization on the input beyond length check. It does not log, obscure, or secure the seed phrases before transmission. The approach indicates that this code could be used to exfiltrate sensitive information covertly or maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive seed phrases by sending them via Telegram, which constitutes malicious behavior. It hardcodes credentials and transmits unencrypted sensitive data, indicating a high security risk. The purpose appears to be malicious or unauthorized data collection.",
