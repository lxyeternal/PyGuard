  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them as a message via the Telegram Bot API.",
  "sources": "Input from user via input() function: 'secret_words'. Data is read from standard input.",
  "sinks": "Requests made to the Telegram API endpoint 'https://api.telegram.org/bot{bot_token}/sendMessage' with the seed phrases in the payload.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> input() captures data -> message is constructed -> HTTP POST request to Telegram API with seed phrases.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly sends sensitive seed phrases over an external API without encryption or obfuscation. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, which can be exploited if exposed. No validation of seed phrase content. No error handling beyond sys.exit(). The seed phrases are stored and transmitted in plaintext.",
  "analysis": "The script collects 12 seed phrases from user input, which are sensitive and private. It then constructs a message and sends it via the Telegram Bot API to a specified chat ID. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, making the credentials potentially accessible if the code is shared or leaked. The code does not perform any input sanitization or validation beyond checking for the number of seed words. It transmits the seed phrases as plaintext without encryption, raising privacy and security concerns. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data theft, system compromise, or backdoors. However, the act of transmitting sensitive seed data to an external service without proper safeguards constitutes a significant security risk. The code appears straightforward with no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the insecure handling and transmission of sensitive seed phrases by sending them directly via Telegram. While there is no active malicious behavior like data exfiltration or backdoors, the practice of transmitting unencrypted private seed data to an external API is a serious security vulnerability and could be exploited if misused. Overall, the code poses a high security risk due to potential leakage of confidential information.",
