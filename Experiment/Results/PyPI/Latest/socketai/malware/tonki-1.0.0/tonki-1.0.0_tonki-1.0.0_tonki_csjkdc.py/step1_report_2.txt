  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them via a Telegram bot message.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function for seed phrases.",
  "targets": "The Telegram API endpoint to send messages, transmitting seed phrases.",
  "flows": "Input of seed phrases → creation of message → POST request to Telegram API with seed data.",
  "anomalies": "The seed phrases are taken directly from user input without validation or encryption, and sent in plain text to a third-party API. Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID are security concerns. No sanitization or access control is implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code prompts the user to input 12 seed phrases for authorization. It then constructs a message containing these seed phrases and sends it via the Telegram Bot API. The presence of hardcoded bot token and chat ID indicates poor security practices. The direct transmission of sensitive seed phrases over a network, without any encryption or user consent confirmation, presents a severe security risk. There are no obfuscation techniques or complex logic, but the handling of sensitive information is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if used without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to exfiltrate seed phrases by sending them to a Telegram account, which is a malicious activity. It does not perform any validation or obfuscation and uses hardcoded credentials. Overall, it poses a high security risk and likely malicious intent.",
