  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them as a message to a specified Telegram chat via a bot API.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function for seed phrases; bot_token and chat_id variables within the code.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() function sending data to Telegram API endpoint, transmitting the collected seed phrases.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> stored in 'secret_words' -> concatenated into 'message' -> sent via requests.post to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "The seed phrases are collected and immediately sent over the network without encryption or additional security measures; hardcoded bot token and chat ID; no validation or encryption of sensitive data; lack of error handling or obfuscation; potential for abuse if misused.",
  "analysis": "The code prompts the user to enter 12 seed phrases, which are stored in a list. It verifies the length to be exactly 12, then constructs a message containing these phrases. The message is sent to a Telegram chat using a bot API. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, and the seed phrases are transmitted in plain text, posing a security risk. There is no obfuscation, encryption, or validation beyond length check, indicating potential malicious intent if misused. The data flow involves user input directly being sent over the network without any safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects sensitive seed phrases and sends them unencrypted over the network to a Telegram chat, representing a significant security risk. The hardcoded credentials and lack of data protection measures suggest malicious intent or severe negligence. It should be considered highly suspicious and dangerous.",
