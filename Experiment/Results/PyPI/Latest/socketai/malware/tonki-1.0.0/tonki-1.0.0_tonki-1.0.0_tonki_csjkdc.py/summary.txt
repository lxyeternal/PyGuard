  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates sensitive seed phrases over an insecure channel with hardcoded credentials, representing high security risk and malicious intent. The activity justifies a malware score around 0.9 and a security risk score of approximately 0.9. The code is not obfuscated. The behavior is suspicious and dangerous, warranting serious concern."
