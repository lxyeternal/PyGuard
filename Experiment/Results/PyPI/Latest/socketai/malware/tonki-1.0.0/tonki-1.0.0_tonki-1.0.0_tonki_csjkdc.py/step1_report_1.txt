  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them via Telegram API for notification or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "User input via the input() function for seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "Requests to the Telegram API endpoint that sends messages containing sensitive seed phrases.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> Seed phrases are concatenated into a message -> Message is sent to Telegram API endpoint via HTTP POST request.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly transmits sensitive seed phrases over an external API without any encryption or obfuscation. Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID are present, which could be misused if accessed maliciously. The input prompt asks for seed phrases in a potentially suspicious context, and the code lacks validation or anonymization.",
  "analysis": "The script requests 12 seed phrases from the user, then constructs a message containing these phrases. The message is sent to a Telegram chat via the bot API. The presence of hardcoded credentials (bot token and chat ID) is concerning, as it could allow unauthorized access to the bot or message interception if the code is leaked. The transmission of seed phrases over a network is a significant security risk, especially since it is sent unencrypted in the request payload. No obfuscation or encryption is applied. The code does not include any validation beyond checking for 12 phrases, nor does it handle errors beyond a simple exit, which may lead to leakage or misuse of seed data.",
  "conclusion": "The code captures sensitive seed phrases from the user and transmits them directly to a Telegram chat using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. This behavior indicates malicious intent or at least highly insecure handling of sensitive data, representing a significant security risk. The code appears designed to exfiltrate seed phrases, potentially maliciously.",
