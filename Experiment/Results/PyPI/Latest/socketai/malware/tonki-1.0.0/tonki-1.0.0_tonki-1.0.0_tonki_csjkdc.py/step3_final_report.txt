  "purpose": "Exfiltrate 12 seed phrases entered by the user via Telegram API using hardcoded credentials.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function for seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() call sending data to https://api.telegram.org, transmitting seed phrases in plaintext.",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> seed phrases stored in 'secret_words' -> concatenated into 'message' -> sent via requests.post() to Telegram API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded bot token and chat ID; transmission of sensitive seed phrases over network without encryption; no validation or sanitization beyond length check.",
  "analysis": "The code collects 12 seed phrases securely from user input, then constructs a message and transmits it via Telegram API with hardcoded credentials. It does not obfuscate or encrypt data, making the transmission insecure. The presence of hardcoded credentials and plaintext exfiltration of sensitive data are security vulnerabilities. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, but the behavior indicates potential malicious intent, especially if used without user consent. The high malware and security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by the exfiltration activity, though the malware score should be slightly lowered if considering the absence of actual malicious payloads. Overall, the code's behavior is highly insecure and potentially malicious due to data exfiltration, warranting high security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates sensitive seed phrases over an insecure channel with hardcoded credentials, representing high security risk and malicious intent. The activity justifies a malware score around 0.9 and a security risk score of approximately 0.9. The code is not obfuscated. The behavior is suspicious and dangerous, warranting serious concern.",
