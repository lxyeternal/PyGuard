  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, file reads, or user inputs; however, the code snippet provided does not specify explicit data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess executions; the code does not explicitly demonstrate such operations.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows identified in the snippet, indicating no evident untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated patterns are observed. The code structure appears straightforward and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet contains basic functions and standard library usage with no signs of malicious intent. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network communications, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms. The absence of external input handling or unsafe operations suggests this code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears normal and safe for use.",
