  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a typical `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project.\n- It reads static data from strings and a file (`README.md`), with no dynamic or user input involved.\n- The only potentially unusual aspect is the URL pointing to a Telegram link (`https://t.me/pozozal`), which is unconventional for package repositories but not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script.\n- **Findings:** Unusual URL (Telegram link), but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The URL is unconventional but not malicious.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script.\n- **Findings:** Uses `open()` without exception handling, but this is a minor concern, not a security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0.\n- **Justification:** The absence of exception handling isn't malicious but could be improved. The score of 0.1 for securityRisk seems reasonable, given the minor concern.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script.\n- **Findings:** Unusual URL (Telegram link), but no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup script.\n- **Findings:** Same as above; URL is unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring consistency:**\n- All reports agree that there is no malware present.\n- The `malware` score should remain 0.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0 across all, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low, reflecting minor concerns about reading files without error handling or the unconventional URL.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Given the minor issues (like reading files without exception handling and the unconventional URL), a score around 0.1 to 0.2 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign `setup.py` script.\n- No malicious or security-critical issues are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (due to minor concerns like lack of error handling and unconventional URL)\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The only notable aspect is the URL pointing to a Telegram link, which is unusual for package repositories but not malicious.
