  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'tonki'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or perform risky operations.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md content flows into the setup configuration to include detailed package description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'open' to read 'README.md' without error handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script defining package metadata and dependencies. It reads a README file for description, specifies package requirements, and sets metadata such as author info and classifiers. No untrusted data sources, no malicious code, no suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code present. The URL is a Telegram link, which is unconventional for project URLs but not malicious by itself. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'open' without exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious.",
