{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'tonki' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies ('requests'), package data (README.md), and metadata fields such as URL, author, and email.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data outputs or dangerous sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads static package info and dependencies; no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the URL is a Telegram link which is not inherently malicious but unconventional for package URLs. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to package a Python project. It reads the README.md file for long description, specifies dependencies, and sets package metadata. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or suspicious data flows. The URL points to a Telegram link, which is uncommon for package repositories but not malicious per se. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The use of a Telegram URL is unconventional but not inherently malicious.",
