{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'tonki'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package requirements from the 'install_requires' list and reads the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into 'long_description'; package metadata is configured for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The 'url' points to a Telegram link, which is unusual for project URLs but not malicious. The email address appears generic but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the long description directly from a file without processing. No user input, environment variables, or external data manipulation occurs. No code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The URL in the metadata is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, this is typical packaging setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
