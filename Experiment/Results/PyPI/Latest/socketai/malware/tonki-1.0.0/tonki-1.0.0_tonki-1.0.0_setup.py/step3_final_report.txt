  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'tonki'.",
  "sources": "Static strings in setup() parameters, reading 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from code into setup() parameters; no dynamic or external input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional URL pointing to a Telegram link; reading 'README.md' without error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static metadata. No dynamic code, user input, or network activity is present. The URL is unusual but not malicious. Reading 'README.md' without exception handling is a minor coding concern but not a security issue. No obfuscation or malicious payloads detected. The minor risk score reflects the unconventional URL and lack of error handling, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only noteworthy aspect is the Telegram URL, which is unconventional but not harmful. The code adheres to standard practices and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
