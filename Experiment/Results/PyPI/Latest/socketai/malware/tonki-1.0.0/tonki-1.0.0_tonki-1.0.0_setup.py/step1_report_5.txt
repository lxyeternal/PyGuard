{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'tonki' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the long description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "The only flow is reading the 'README.md' file content into the long_description field.",
  "anomalies": "The URL points to a Telegram link ('https://t.me/pozozal'), which is unusual for a typical package repository. No other suspicious code or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It uses 'find_packages()' to include all packages, specifies dependencies, and sets metadata. The URL to a Telegram link is unconventional but not inherently malicious. There are no code injection, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an unusual URL but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The package appears safe based on the provided code.",
