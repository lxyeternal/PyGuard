{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'tonki', intended for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description, and gathers package metadata from static strings and 'find_packages()'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or user input are present; the code primarily loads static data and package info.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading static files and assigning static metadata to package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It imports setup and find_packages, then calls setup() with package metadata, including name, version, packages, dependencies, description, URL, author info, classifiers, and Python version requirements. The only potentially dynamic part is reading 'README.md' for long description, which is typical and safe. No external input, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or security risks detected. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
