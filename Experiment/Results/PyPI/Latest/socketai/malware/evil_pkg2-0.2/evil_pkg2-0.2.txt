The package name and URL are misleading. The activity warrants caution but does not confirm malware. Scores should be adjusted downward to reflect the absence of malicious code, with malware around 0.2-0.3 and risk around 0.3-0.4."

The overall security risk is severe, and the malware score should be set to 1. The benign code is free of such patterns, with low risk and malware scores. The current scores for the suspicious code are justified, and benign code scores are appropriate."
