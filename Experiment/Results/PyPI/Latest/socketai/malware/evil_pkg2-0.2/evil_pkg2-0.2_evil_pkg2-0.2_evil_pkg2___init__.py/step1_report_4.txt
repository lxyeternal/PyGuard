{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs a specific task, but the exact purpose is not explicitly stated due to lack of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or network resources if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to console output, files, or sent over the network. Specific sink locations depend on code details such as print statements, file writes, or socket communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input, environment variables) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks (output, network).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious function calls are detected. However, if dynamic execution or obfuscated code is present, it could be malicious. The code structure appears straightforward, but lack of comments complicates analysis.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: The code's main functions and data flow were reviewed for suspicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, network connections to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration. Step 2: Checks for hardcoded secrets or credentials revealed no clear examples. Step 3: Any use of dangerous functions like eval, exec, or system calls were scrutinized; none detected. Step 4: Review of third-party libraries indicates standard use, not suspicious. Step 5: Absence of obfuscation or unusual constructs suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. Step 6: Overall, the code seems benign but lacks comments or explicit purpose, warranting a cautious confidence level.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit clear signs of malicious behavior or malware. Its overall security risk is low. However, due to incomplete context and minimal documentation, some uncertainty remains. No malicious payload or suspicious activity identified.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
