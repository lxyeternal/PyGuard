  "conclusion": "The dependency contains high-risk malicious patterns, notably eval()/exec() with untrusted data and hardcoded credentials, indicating likely malicious behavior. The overall security risk is severe, and the malware score should be set to 1. The benign code is free of such patterns, with low risk and malware scores. The current scores for the suspicious code are justified, and benign code scores are appropriate."
