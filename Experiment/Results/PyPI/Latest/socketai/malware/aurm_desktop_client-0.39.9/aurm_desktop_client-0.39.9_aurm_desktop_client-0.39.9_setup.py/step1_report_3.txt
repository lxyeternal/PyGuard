{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the installation process of a Python package to fetch external data and modify user shell configuration files during installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://fleetwood-dataset.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fleetwooddb' from which data is downloaded; the user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile).",
  "sinks": "Writing to ~/.fleetwood.py, appending commands to ~/.zshrc and ~/.bash_profile, which could execute the downloaded script or contain malicious commands.",
  "flows": "The code downloads data from the URL, saves it to ~/.fleetwood.py, then appends commands to shell profiles to run this script, potentially executing malicious code at shell startup.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically fetching and executing external data during package installation, writing potentially unverified scripts to user configuration files, lack of validation of downloaded content, suppression of exceptions which may hide failures.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command to download a script from an external URL during installation. It then writes this script to ~/.fleetwood.py. It also appends a command to run this script in user's shell configuration files (~/.zshrc, ~/.bash_profile). No validation or checksum is performed on the downloaded content, and exceptions are suppressed, preventing detection of failures. This behavior can lead to remote code execution, persistent malware, or backdoors being installed on the user's system, especially since the script is executed indirectly via shell startup commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious-like behavior by downloading and executing external code during package installation without validation, modifying user shell configuration files to run potentially untrusted scripts, which poses a significant security risk. This behavior is indicative of malicious intent or sabotage.",
