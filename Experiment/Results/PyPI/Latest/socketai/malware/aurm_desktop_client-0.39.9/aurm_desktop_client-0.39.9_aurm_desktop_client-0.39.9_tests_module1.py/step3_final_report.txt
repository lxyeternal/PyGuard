{
  "purpose": "A simple Python function returning a static string, likely used for testing or placeholder purposes.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; the code is self-contained.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output channels that could leak data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function simply returns a fixed string without external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function that returns a static string. It does not read inputs, write outputs beyond the return, depend on external data, or perform any operations that could be malicious. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies confirm that it poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
