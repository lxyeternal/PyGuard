  "purpose": "Standard Python package initialization, importing a function from a local module and exposing it.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .module1",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling",
  "flows": "Import of test_function from .module1 to __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and typical for package init files",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py that imports a function and exposes it. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code. No external data flows, network activity, or vulnerabilities are evident. The confidence in benign assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe package initialization script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are accurate and consistent with the analysis.",
