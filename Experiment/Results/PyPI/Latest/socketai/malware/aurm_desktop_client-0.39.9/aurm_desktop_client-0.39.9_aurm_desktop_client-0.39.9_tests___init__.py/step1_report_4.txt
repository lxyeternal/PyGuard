  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the import simply makes a function available",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py file that imports 'test_function' from a local module 'module1' and exposes it via __all__. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The structure is typical for Python package initialization, and no external or untrusted data is handled here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks.",
