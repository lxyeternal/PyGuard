{
  "purpose": "This file initializes the package namespace by importing a test function from a module, likely for testing or development purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module '.module1' when importing 'test_function'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data or external output is generated by this script.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import 'test_function' from '.module1', then expose it via __all__ for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code is standard for Python package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The script only imports a function from a local module and declares it as part of the package's public API. There are no external data sources, no data processing, no code execution beyond standard import statements. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. It appears to be a simple test module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python testing setups, and shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
