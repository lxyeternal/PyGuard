  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "This is a standard package initialization file that imports a specific function and sets __all__ for module exports. It contains no network operations, data handling, or security-sensitive behavior. No suspicious activities or malicious code indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical __init__.py file with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply exposes 'test_function' from 'module1'.",
