  "purpose": "Manage Azure Machine Learning workspace setup, resource groups, and compute provisioning using environment variables for credentials and configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for tenant ID, service principal ID, password, subscription ID, resource group name, workspace name, and location.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK calls for resource group creation and workspace provisioning; no data leaks or external network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start; used in authentication and resource creation functions; no external data flows outside SDK interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Nested getenv calls (e.g., os.getenv(os.getenv(...))) are unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure ML workspace and resource group management using SDKs. It relies on environment variables for secrets, which is common but can pose security risks if environment is compromised. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The nested getenv calls are atypical but serve as variable indirection, not obfuscation. No signs of malware or malicious intent. The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The security risk is low, primarily due to reliance on environment variables, which is standard in cloud scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical environmental risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and performs its intended infrastructure management functions without malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The main security consideration is ensuring environment variables are secured, but this is standard practice. No further action required.",
