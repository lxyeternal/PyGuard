  "sinks": "Azure SDK functions (Workspace.create, resource_client_factory, resource_groups.create_or_update) that perform network and resource management actions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Authentication object → Azure resource management → Workspace creation and resource group setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables with nested getenv calls (e.g., os.getenv(os.getenv(...))) which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or credentials present. No suspicious network calls or file manipulations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code authenticates with Azure using service principal credentials stored in environment variables. It creates or verifies the existence of resource groups and workspaces using Azure SDKs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is present. The environment variables are used for configuration and authentication, which is standard practice. The code performs resource provisioning and workspace setup securely without evident malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Azure ML workspace setup utility with no signs of malicious behavior. It manages resources securely and relies on environment variables for sensitive data, which is typical. There are no malicious code patterns or suspicious network actions detected.",
