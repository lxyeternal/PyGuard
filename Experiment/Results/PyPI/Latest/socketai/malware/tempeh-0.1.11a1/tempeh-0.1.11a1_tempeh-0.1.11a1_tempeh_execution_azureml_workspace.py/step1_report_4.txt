  "purpose": "Utilities to connect to an Azure Machine Learning workspace for tracking performance test results.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: VARIABLE_NAME_TENANT_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION.",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK calls that create or update resource groups and workspaces, which could potentially be misused if environment variables are maliciously set to incorrect values.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start; credentials are used to authenticate and create/update resources in Azure; resource group and workspace are created or ensured to exist.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nested getenv calls (e.g., os.getenv(os.getenv(...))) could lead to misconfiguration or failures, but not malicious per se. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code reads sensitive environment variables related to Azure credentials and configuration. It uses these credentials to authenticate and ensure that specific resource groups and workspaces exist in Azure. The process appears standard and appropriate for infrastructure setup. No indications of data leakage, malicious data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The only potential concern is reliance on environment variables for sensitive data, but this is common practice and not malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Azure resources, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It securely uses environment variables for credentials, and all SDK calls are standard. No malware or security risks are evident.",
