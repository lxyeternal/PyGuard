  "purpose": "Utilities to connect to and manage an Azure Machine Learning workspace, including resource group and workspace creation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: VARIABLE_NAME_TENANT_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION.",
  "sinks": "The code uses environment variables for credentials and workspace info, but does not directly handle untrusted input beyond environment variable reading. No explicit data leaks or external data transfers are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Authentication object; Environment variables -> resource group and workspace creation functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive data is standard but can be risky if environment is compromised. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code creates resource groups and workspaces but does not validate or sanitize environment variable values; however, this is typical for infrastructure management scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles Azure ML workspace setup using environment variables for configuration and authentication. It employs standard SDK functions for resource group and workspace creation. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network communication outside Azure, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Use of environment variables for secrets is common but can be risky if the environment is insecure. The code is straightforward and functional, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for Azure ML workspace management without malicious intent. It employs standard SDKs and practices, with no evidence of malware or security risks. The primary concern is reliance on environment variables, which is typical but should be secured appropriately.",
