{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to automate the setup and management of an Azure Machine Learning workspace, including resource group and compute target provisioning.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as VARIABLE_NAME_TENANT_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_ID, VARIABLE_NAME_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_PASSWORD, SUBSCRIPTION_ID, RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME, WORKSPACE_NAME, WORKSPACE_LOCATION",
  "sinks": "Azure SDK functions that create or update resource groups and workspaces, potentially modifying cloud resources based on environment variables",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> auth credentials -> Azure resource management client -> creation/update of resource group and workspace",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive data; dynamic resource management via SDK; no hardcoded secrets or credentials present; no suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code or unusual language features",
  "analysis": "The code reads configuration and credential data primarily from environment variables, which is standard practice for cloud automation scripts. It authenticates using a service principal and then creates or updates Azure resource groups and workspaces via SDK calls. The environment variables for secrets are dynamically looked up, avoiding hardcoded secrets. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code performs expected Azure SDK operations for resource management with proper logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and intended for cloud resource management. No malicious behavior or malware indications are present. The use of environment variables for secrets is typical for such scripts, and no suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
