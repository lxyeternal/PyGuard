  "purpose": "Utility functions to connect to and set up an Azure Machine Learning workspace and resource group.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv) for credentials and configuration details.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data output or network connections outside expected Azure SDK interactions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (sources) are used to configure credentials and workspace info, which are then used to authenticate and create resource groups and workspaces.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nested environment variable lookups (e.g., os.getenv(os.getenv())) could be misused to obscure or manipulate credentials, but in this context, it appears intended for variable indirection. No hardcoded secrets found. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages environment variables for credentials and creates Azure resources via SDK calls. It does not contain any code injection, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The use of environment variables for credentials is standard, though the nested getenv could potentially be misused if misconfigured. No malicious or suspicious logic is present; it is a straightforward resource setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate utility for Azure ML workspace setup with no indications of malicious intent. The use of environment variables is standard, and no suspicious behavior or malware signs are detected.",
