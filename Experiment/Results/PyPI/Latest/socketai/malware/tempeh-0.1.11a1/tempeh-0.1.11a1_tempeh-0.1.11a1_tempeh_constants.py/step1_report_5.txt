  "purpose": "Define constants for a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all constants are hardcoded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to potentially malicious operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines constants without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden logic; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with string constants representing various categories such as data types, algorithms, tasks, metrics, datasets, and parameters. There are no functions, data input/output, or dynamic code execution. The constants appear to serve as static configuration or enumeration values for a larger framework. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leakage, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely defines constants for use in a machine learning framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious logic, or security risks.",
