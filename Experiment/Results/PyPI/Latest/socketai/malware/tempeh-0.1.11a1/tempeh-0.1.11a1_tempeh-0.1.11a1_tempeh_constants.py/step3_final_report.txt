  "purpose": "Defines constants for use in a machine learning performance testing framework, including data types, algorithms, tasks, metrics, parameters, datasets, and related configurations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions containing string constants and numerical parameters; no input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "Static references to constants; no data flow or dynamic execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with string constants and numerical parameters serving as configuration for a performance testing framework. It contains no input/output operations, dynamic code execution, or external dependencies. All security assessments from the reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the static, configuration-only nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) reflects the clarity and safety of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static constants module for a machine learning framework, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores provided are accurate and justified. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
