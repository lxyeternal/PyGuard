{
  "purpose": "This code defines various constants and class variables for use in a performance testing framework related to machine learning.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that could leak untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions and constant assignments for organizing parameters, metrics, datasets, and configurations used in a machine learning performance testing framework. There are no input/output operations, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. The structure and content are typical for configuration or constants modules, with no signs of obfuscated code, malware, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign configuration module with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It serves as a structured set of constants for a performance testing framework without any evidence of security threats.",
