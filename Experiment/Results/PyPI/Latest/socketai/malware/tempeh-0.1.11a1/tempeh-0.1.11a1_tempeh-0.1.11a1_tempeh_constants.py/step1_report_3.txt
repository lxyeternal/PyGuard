  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines constants and class variables, no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no data processing or input handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are detected. All constants are straightforward, well-documented, and intended for configuration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with string constants for various categories such as data types, algorithms, tasks, metrics, datasets, and parameters. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The constants are used for configuration within a machine learning testing framework. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard and purpose-specific, with no indications of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign collection of constants used for configuration in a machine learning performance testing context. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a straightforward, well-structured setup for a larger framework.",
