  "purpose": "Definition of constants and configuration parameters for a performance testing framework related to machine learning models and datasets.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; all data appears to be predefined constant values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable operations; the code does not perform data processing or I/O.",
  "flows": "N/A; as the code only defines constants and static variables, there are no data flow paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of class definitions with string constants and numerical values.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple class definitions with constants for dataset names, model parameters, metrics, and other configuration values. It appears to serve as a centralized constants module for a larger performance testing or machine learning framework. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious logic is present. All elements are static and well-structured, indicating standard, maintainable code for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign collection of constant definitions for a machine learning performance testing framework. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
