  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration parameters for a machine learning performance testing framework.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading sources; all constants are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or processing functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code solely consists of class and constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of class-based constant definitions used for configuration in a machine learning framework. It contains no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured constants module with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining constants for use in a machine learning testing framework. It contains no malicious, suspicious, or security-threatening elements.",
