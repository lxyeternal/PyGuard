  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code content, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple assignment of a version string with licensing comments.\n- The code is straightforward, with no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code snippets are identical in purpose and structure.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets are just variable assignment and comments; no additional code or logic exists.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; the code is purely metadata.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** None; the code does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-issue review:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Defines version info. Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)\n  - Confidence: 1 (appropriate)\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** License header and version string. Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no issues.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1, appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Set version string. Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; minimal code, no risks.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Metadata declaration. Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Set package version info. Correct.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, confidence 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All are 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1 for all, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are accurate in their conclusions.\n- The code is a standard package metadata snippet with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No adjustments needed for scores.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as harmless metadata. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
