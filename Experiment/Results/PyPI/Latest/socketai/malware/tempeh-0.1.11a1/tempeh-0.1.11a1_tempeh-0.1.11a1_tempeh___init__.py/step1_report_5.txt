  "anomalies": "Minimal; only version string assignment, no suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a copyright and license comment, a version string assignment, and license statements. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no external data sinks or network operations. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a minimal metadata fragment typical of Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to specify package version information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
