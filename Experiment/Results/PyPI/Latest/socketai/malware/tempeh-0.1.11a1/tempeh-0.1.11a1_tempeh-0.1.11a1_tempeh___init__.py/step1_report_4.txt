  "purpose": "Metadata declaration and licensing information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow; code does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only version and license comments, no functional code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments, a copyright statement, license note, and a version string. There are no functions, classes, input handling, data processing, or other executable code. This is typical for the initial part of a Python module or package metadata, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. The absence of any code logic means no potential for malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues is present here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata and contains no executable or suspicious elements. It poses no security risk.",
