  "purpose": "Define package version information with licensing comments.",
  "sources": "License comments and version string assignment (__version__ = \"0.1.11a1\")",
  "sinks": "None; no input/output or data flow present",
  "flows": "None; code is static metadata",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward assignment with licensing comments, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static snippet consisting of licensing comments and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is typical for package metadata and contains no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata snippet with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
