  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the snippets are purely licensing comments with no executable code, data input/output, or data flows.\n   - There are no signs of code obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that these snippets are benign licensing headers.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident. They correctly identify the absence of code and malicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all snippets are just license comments with no executable code, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the lack of executable code or suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the content of the snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- Given that these are only licensing comments, the risk is negligible.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on these snippets.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippets are benign licensing headers with no security implications. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the actual content.",
