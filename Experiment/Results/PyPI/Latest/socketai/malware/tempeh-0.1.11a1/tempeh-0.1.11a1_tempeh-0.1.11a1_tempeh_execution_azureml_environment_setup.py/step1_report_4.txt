  "purpose": "Configure an Azure Machine Learning environment with optional private wheel and required dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'requirements.txt' file, optional wheel file input, environment configuration.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input directly, but environment setup can involve external dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reading 'requirements.txt' -> adding private wheel (if provided) -> adding azureml SDK package -> enabling Docker.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up an Azure ML environment, adding dependencies from a requirements file and an optional private wheel. It enables Docker for environment consistency. No external data is processed unsafely, and the code uses established Azure ML SDK functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious data flows. The logic is straightforward and aligns with standard environment configuration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate environment configuration script for Azure Machine Learning with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
