  "purpose": "Configure an Azure ML environment with specified requirements and optional private wheel.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'requirements.txt' file, optional 'wheel_file' input, environment configuration methods, and adding packages.",
  "sinks": "Potentially adds private pip wheel to environment, modifies conda dependencies, and enables Docker.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements file -> Adding private wheel (if provided) -> Adding azureml-sdk package -> Enabling Docker.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; use of environment variables appears standard; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and azureml.core.Environment to set up a machine learning environment. It reads requirements from a file, optionally adds a private wheel, adds azureml-sdk, and enables Docker. All operations are typical for environment setup in Azure ML. No suspicious, malicious, or maliciously obfuscated patterns are present. The functions appear to be legitimate for environment configuration without any hidden or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Azure ML environment configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
