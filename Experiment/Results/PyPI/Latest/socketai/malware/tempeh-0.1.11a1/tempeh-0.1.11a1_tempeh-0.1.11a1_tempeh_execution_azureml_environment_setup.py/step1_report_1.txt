  "purpose": "Configure an Azure Machine Learning environment with optional private wheel and necessary dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements.txt, optional wheel_file parameter, environment configuration functions.",
  "sinks": "Environment setup functions that could potentially load external packages or execute subprocesses (though not used here).",
  "flows": "requirements.txt -> environment creation -> optional wheel_file -> environment modifications",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of subprocess for execution, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscated code. The code uses AzureML SDK functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an Azure ML Environment object, adds dependencies from a requirements file, optionally adds a private pip wheel if provided, and includes 'azureml-sdk'. It enables Docker for the environment and logs a success message. No external inputs are directly executed as code; the functions used are standard SDK calls. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. It appears to be standard environment setup code for Azure ML workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on environment configuration for Azure Machine Learning with no evident malicious behavior or security risks.",
