  "purpose": "Configure an AzureML environment by loading requirements, optionally adding a private pip wheel, and enabling Docker for AzureML compute.",
  "sources": "requirements.txt file, optional wheel_file parameter for private wheel, environment.add_private_pip_wheel method, environment.python.conda_dependencies.add_pip_package calls",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only interacts with AzureML SDK functions and local files",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies from requirements.txt -> adds optional private wheel -> adds azureml-sdk -> enables Docker -> returns environment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment setup with standard SDK functions; no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AzureML environment configuration: loading dependencies from a requirements file, optionally adding a private wheel via AzureML SDK, adding azureml-sdk package, enabling Docker. It does not execute external code, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated logic. The handling of private wheels involves uploading to Azure Blob storage, which is standard in AzureML workflows. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is well-structured, and the operations are typical for environment setup. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard AzureML environment configuration script with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. The private wheel handling is a normal operation within AzureML workflows and does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe, and no changes to the scores are warranted.",
