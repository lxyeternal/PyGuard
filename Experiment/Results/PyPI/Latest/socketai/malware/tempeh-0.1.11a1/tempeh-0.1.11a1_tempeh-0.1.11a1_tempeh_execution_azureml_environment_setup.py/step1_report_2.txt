  "purpose": "Configure an Azure ML environment with optional private wheel and necessary dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements.txt for external dependencies, optional wheel_file parameter for private wheel, environment configuration functions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Read requirements.txt -> Configure environment -> Add private wheel if provided -> Add azureml-sdk -> Enable Docker",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code follows standard environment setup procedures with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a function to configure an Azure ML environment, reads dependencies from a requirements file, optionally adds a private pip wheel, includes azureml-sdk, and enables Docker. All operations are standard for environment setup. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward environment configuration script for Azure ML, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any suspicious actions or leak sensitive information.",
