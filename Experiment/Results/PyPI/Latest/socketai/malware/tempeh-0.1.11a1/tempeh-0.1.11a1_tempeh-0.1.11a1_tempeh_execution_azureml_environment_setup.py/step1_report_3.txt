  "purpose": "Configure an Azure ML environment with specified requirements and optional private wheel.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for external requirements, optional private wheel file input, and workspace context for adding private packages.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment.add_private_pip_wheel() which involves uploading a wheel to Azure Blob storage, but no direct untrusted data sink or external network connection is evident.",
  "flows": "Reads requirements from file -> optionally uploads private wheel -> adds azureml-sdk -> enables docker -> returns environment object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code present. Usage of external files and Azure SDK methods appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and AzureML SDK components. It configures an environment object by loading requirements from a file and optionally adding a private wheel. The process involves adding pip packages and enabling Docker, which are typical steps for environment setup. No data is being sent over the network outside Azure SDK interactions, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears to perform legitimate environment configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward environment configuration script for Azure ML. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The only potential concern could be the handling of private wheel files, but this is a standard operation within Azure ML workflows and not inherently malicious.",
