  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of wrapper classes and functions for creating and training Keras models for classification and regression.\n- It imports keras, tensorflow, numpy, and suppresses stderr during import to hide verbose logs.\n- Model creation functions are straightforward, with standard layers, compile, and fit steps.\n- No network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns.\n- Use of stderr suppression is typical for cleaner logs, not malicious.\n- Dataset inputs are used solely for training; no inference or external data handling suspicious in context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines Keras model wrappers and creation functions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, standard ML code.\n- **Score justifications:**\n  - Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n  - Security risk: 0.2 (low, due to stderr suppression)\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar wrapper classes and functions.\n- **Analysis:** Standard ML code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, standard practice.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.1, reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Wrapper classes and functions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, standard code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports describe standard ML wrapper code with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- **Malware score:** All zero, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, justified.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), justified by stderr suppression, which is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly due to stderr suppression, which is common and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are appropriate given the code's nature. No security risks or malware are evident. The code appears to be a typical implementation of Keras model wrappers for ML tasks.",
