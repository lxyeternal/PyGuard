{
  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes for Keras models (regression, binary classification, multiclass classification) and functions to create and compile these models.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as keras, tensorflow, numpy, os, sys; reads dataset attributes like shape and size; uses keras utilities for data conversion.",
  "sinks": "Model compilation and training functions (fit), model creation functions, keras utilities, and environment variable handling.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to model creation functions; dataset attributes flow into model constructors; data flows into model.fit() calls; model outputs are returned.",
  "anomalies": "Suppresses stderr during imports, which may hide warnings or errors; no use of untrusted data sources or external network communications; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports keras and tensorflow in a manner that suppresses error messages to avoid visibility of import issues, but this is a standard practice and not inherently malicious. The core functions create neural network models for regression and classification, training them immediately with the provided datasets. The model architecture is simple and consistent, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No external data sources, network communications, or system modifications are present. The environment variable handling is limited to suppressing stderr temporarily, which may hide import errors but does not pose a security risk. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation of neural network wrappers and does not contain malicious or maliciously intended behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Keras model wrappers for regression and classification tasks with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The suppression of stderr during import is benign and typical for silent error handling. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious code is detected.",
