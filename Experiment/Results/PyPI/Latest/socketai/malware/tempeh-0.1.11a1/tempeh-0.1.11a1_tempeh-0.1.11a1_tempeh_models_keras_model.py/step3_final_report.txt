  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes and functions for creating, compiling, and training Keras models for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Dataset attributes (_X_train, _y_train), input data during model.fit() calls",
  "sinks": "Model training functions, no external data handling or network communication",
  "flows": "Dataset data flows into model creation functions, then into model.fit() for training",
  "anomalies": "Suppression of stderr during imports to hide verbose logs; no malicious code or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Keras model wrappers for classification and regression tasks. It imports keras and tensorflow, suppresses verbose logs, and defines functions to create and train models with standard layers and compile steps. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The suppression of stderr is a common practice to reduce log noise, not malicious. The dataset inputs are used solely for training, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious manipulation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2), justified by benign practices like stderr suppression. Overall, the code is a typical ML wrapper with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of Keras model wrappers for ML tasks, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The suppression of stderr is benign. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent across reports. No modifications are necessary.",
