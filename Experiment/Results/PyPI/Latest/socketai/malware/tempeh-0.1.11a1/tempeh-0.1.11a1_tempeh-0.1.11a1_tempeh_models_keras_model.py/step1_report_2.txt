{
  "purpose": "Defines wrapper classes and functions for creating and training Keras deep neural network models for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from keras, tensorflow, numpy, and standard libraries; functions creating and compiling models; dataset inputs (X, y).",
  "sinks": "Model fitting (`model.fit`) with dataset inputs; model creation with potentially untrusted data shapes or parameters.",
  "flows": "Dataset inputs (X, y) flow into model creation functions, which generate models and fit them using the datasets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of suppressed standard error for tensorflow import is typical and not suspicious. Model creation code appears standard for ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a wrapper framework for Keras models used in ML tasks, including functions to generate models for regression, binary, and multiclass classification. It uses standard libraries and follows typical ML workflows. No obfuscated language features, malicious network calls, or suspicious behavior are evident. Dataset inputs are used solely for training models; no data leakage or insecure handling detected. No hardcoded secrets or credentials present. The suppression of stderr during import is common to suppress verbose tensorflow logs. The code appears focused on model training and architecture definition without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for ML model setup using Keras, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs typical data processing, model creation, and training routines. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
