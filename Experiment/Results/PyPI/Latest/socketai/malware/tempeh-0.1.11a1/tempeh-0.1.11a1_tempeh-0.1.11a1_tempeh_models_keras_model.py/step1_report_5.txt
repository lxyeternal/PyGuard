{
  "purpose": "Defines Keras-based wrapper classes and functions for creating neural network models for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as keras, tensorflow, numpy, os, sys; reads dataset attributes; uses np.unique for number of classes.",
  "sinks": "Model training calls (model.fit), data conversions (to_categorical), and import statements which could be manipulated.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset inputs to model creation functions, which compile and train models using potentially untrusted dataset data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.stderr redirection to suppress tensorflow logs, which is common but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or credentials. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. No network communications, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for wrapping Keras models tailored for different tasks and functions to create models. It handles dataset inputs, converts labels for multiclass classification, and compiles models. The use of suppressing stderr logs is typical for cleaner output. No external network activity, no suspicious file operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present. Data flows from dataset attributes to model training, which appears legitimate. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of Keras model wrappers and creation functions for common ML tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not perform any network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification activities. The suppression of logs is benign and related to usability.",
