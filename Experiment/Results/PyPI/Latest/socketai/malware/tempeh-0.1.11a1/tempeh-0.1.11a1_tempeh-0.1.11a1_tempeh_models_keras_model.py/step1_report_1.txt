  "purpose": "Defines Keras-based machine learning model wrappers and creation functions for classification and regression tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from keras, tensorflow, numpy, sys, os, and local modules; functions creating models using input data shapes.",
  "sinks": "Model compilation, fit methods, and data transformations such as to_categorical; no high-risk sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) flows into model creation functions, through model compilation, and into training (fit) functions.",
  "anomalies": "Suppresses stderr during module import; uses a standard pattern for model creation. No suspicious or unusual code patterns or hardcoded secrets are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for constructing and training neural network models using Keras. It includes measures to suppress import errors and logs for missing modules. Model creation functions involve standard deep learning practices: defining models, compiling, and training on provided datasets. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of 'sys.stderr' suppression is typical for silent imports but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, secret leaks, or suspicious data handling are present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard implementation for ML model training with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Keras model wrappers and creation functions. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The suppression of stderr during imports is typical for avoiding noisy logs but does not indicate malicious activity. No anomalies or signs of sabotage are present.",
