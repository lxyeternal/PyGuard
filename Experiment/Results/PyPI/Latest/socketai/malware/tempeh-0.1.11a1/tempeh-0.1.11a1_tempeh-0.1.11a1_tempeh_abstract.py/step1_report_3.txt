{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class (ABC) compatible with multiple Python versions using the 'six' library.",
  "sources": "Importing 'six' library, checking 'six.PY3' to determine Python version, importing 'ABC' or defining a compatible class.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "Import and version check flow leading to class definition; no data flows or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard practice for compatibility; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to maintain compatibility for defining an ABC across Python 2 and 3 using the 'six' library. It conditionally imports 'ABC' for Python 3 or defines a compatible class using 'ABCMeta' for Python 2. The code includes standard licensing and copyright notices. No suspicious, malicious, or maliciously obfuscated behaviors are present. The structure is typical for cross-version compatibility support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured compatibility shim for Python ABCs, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs no input/output operations or data handling that could pose security concerns.",
