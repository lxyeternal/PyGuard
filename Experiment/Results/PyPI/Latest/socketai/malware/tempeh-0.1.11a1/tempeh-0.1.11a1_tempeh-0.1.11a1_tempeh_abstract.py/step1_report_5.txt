{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class (ABC) that is compatible across different Python versions using the 'six' library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'six' and conditional import of ABC or ABCMeta based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code only sets up class inheritance structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for maintaining compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'six' library to handle compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3. Depending on the Python version, it imports 'ABC' directly (Python 3) or defines an 'ABC' class with 'ABCMeta' as metaclass (Python 2). This is a standard compatibility pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The code does not process external input or perform any operations beyond setting up a class structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign compatibility utility for defining abstract base classes across Python versions. No malicious activity or security risks detected.",
