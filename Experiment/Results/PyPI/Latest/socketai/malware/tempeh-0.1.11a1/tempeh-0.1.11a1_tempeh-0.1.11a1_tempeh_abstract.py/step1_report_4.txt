  "purpose": "Define an Abstract Base Class (ABC) compatible with multiple Python versions.",
  "sources": "Importing 'six' module for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard version compatibility pattern using 'six'. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'six' to check the Python version and defines an 'ABC' class accordingly for compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It only involves version detection and class definition patterns, with no external data inputs or outputs, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. This is a standard compatibility pattern and does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for defining an abstract base class across Python versions. It does not contain malicious code or security risks.",
