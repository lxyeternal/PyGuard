  "purpose": "Define a version-compatible Abstract Base Class (ABC) for use across Python 2 and Python 3 environments.",
  "sources": "Importing 'six' for version detection, importing ABC or ABCMeta depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external output, or sensitive data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is only importing and defining classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward version compatibility implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'six' library to detect the Python version and conditionally imports the 'ABC' class or 'ABCMeta' metaclass for compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It defines an 'ABC' class in the Python 2 case by setting '__metaclass__'. There are no dynamic code execution, hidden behaviors, or malicious constructs. The code is a standard compatibility pattern used in many open-source projects, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version compatibility utility for defining abstract base classes in a cross-version compatible way. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
