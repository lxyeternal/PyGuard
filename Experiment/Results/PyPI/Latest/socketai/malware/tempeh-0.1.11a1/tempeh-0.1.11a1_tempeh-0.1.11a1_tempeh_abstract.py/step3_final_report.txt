  "purpose": "Compatibility layer to define an abstract base class (ABC) compatible with both Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'six' library, version check 'six.PY3'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external sinks, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Version check via 'six.PY3' leads to conditional import or class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward compatibility pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'six' to determine Python version, then conditionally defines 'ABC' for cross-version compatibility. It does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or contain obfuscation. The logic is standard, well-understood, and widely used in open-source projects. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is simple, clear, and purpose-specific, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports correctly identify its purpose and safety. The assigned scores (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
