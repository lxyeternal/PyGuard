  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class (ABC) that is compatible across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Importing 'six' module to determine Python version; importing ABC or ABCMeta accordingly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only imports modules and defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, version compatibility handling, and licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'six' module to check the Python version and conditionally defines an abstract base class 'ABC' for cross-version compatibility. The licensing comment indicates proper attribution. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The structure is typical for maintaining compatibility between Python 2 and 3. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility shim for defining an abstract base class across Python versions. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and the implementation is straightforward and benign.",
