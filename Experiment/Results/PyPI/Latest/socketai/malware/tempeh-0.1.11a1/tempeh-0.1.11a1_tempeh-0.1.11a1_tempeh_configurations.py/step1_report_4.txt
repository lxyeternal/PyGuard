{
  "purpose": "Defines datasets and models for machine learning experiments, loading various datasets and associating model classes with identifiers.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tempeh' package modules; dataset generation functions called with dataset names and sizes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or external data handling in the code.",
  "flows": "Data is generated via dataset class methods; model classes are assigned to dictionary entries; no data flow from external untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Usage of dataset class generators and model class assignments appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports dataset and model classes from a 'tempeh' library, then creates dictionaries mapping dataset names to generated dataset classes and model names to class references. No input validation, external data handling, or network operations are present. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are identified. The code structure is straightforward and typical for ML setup scripts, with no obfuscated or misleading elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup script for machine learning datasets and models, with no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected.",
