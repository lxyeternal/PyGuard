{
  "purpose": "The code initializes datasets and models for machine learning experiments and enqueues them into dictionaries for later use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tempeh.datasets', 'tempeh.models', and 'tempeh.constants'; dataset generation functions called within dictionary definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data outputs or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; dataset generation calls are internal and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; code consists solely of class imports and dataset/model instantiations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dataset and model classes, then defines dictionaries to hold dataset and model class references or generated dataset classes. All operations are standard, explicit, and do not include any external input, network activity, or data leaks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a typical setup for machine learning experiments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on dataset and model setup without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, and no suspicious activities are evident.",
