{
  "purpose": "The code sets up datasets and models for machine learning experiments by importing classes and generating dataset classes with static parameters.",
  "sources": "Dataset generation functions called with fixed string parameters; class imports from 'tempeh' library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, no data leaks, no network connections, no external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static calls to dataset generation functions and class references; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and dictionary definitions mapping dataset/model names to class references or generated dataset classes. All dataset generation functions are called with hardcoded string parameters, indicating static, controlled data. There are no external inputs, network activity, or data leaks. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or environment manipulation. The structure is typical for ML setup scripts, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a standard setup script for datasets and models, and all signals indicate safety.",
