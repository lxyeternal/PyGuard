{
  "purpose": "The code defines datasets and models for machine learning tasks, primarily wrapping existing dataset generators and model classes for automated enqueuing and training.",
  "sources": "Imports from tempeh.datasets, tempeh.models, and tempeh.constants modules; dataset generation calls within the datasets dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data directly; dataset generation functions and class references are used.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; dataset generation calls generate data internally, and class references are used for model instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. All code appears to be standard library usage for dataset/model setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific dataset wrappers and model classes, then creates dictionaries mapping dataset names to generated dataset classes and model names to class references. There are no dynamic code evaluations, input processing, or external data handling beyond dataset generation calls. All functions and class references appear standard and appropriate for ML workflows. No suspicious or malicious activities, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and consistent with typical data setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dataset and model setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be part of an ML pipeline for benchmarking or training purposes.",
