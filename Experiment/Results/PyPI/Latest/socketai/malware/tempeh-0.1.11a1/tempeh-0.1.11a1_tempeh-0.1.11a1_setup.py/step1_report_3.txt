  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'tempeh' Python library, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, importing 'tempeh' module for metadata, and listing dependencies for installation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Importing 'tempeh' -> setup() using 'tempeh' attributes and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. Standard setup script with dependencies and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and 'tempeh', reads a README file, and configures package setup parameters including dependencies and metadata. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The dependencies are typical for a machine learning project and do not indicate malicious intent. No data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. The code appears to be a standard package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package named 'tempeh'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this script.",
