{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'tempeh' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; imports 'setuptools' and 'tempeh' modules; accesses 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__' for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None involving untrusted data or user input; no direct data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and imports modules; uses 'setuptools.setup' to configure package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated elements present; the code is standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script for packaging a project named 'tempeh'. It reads a local README file and sets up package metadata using 'setuptools'. It imports the 'tempeh' module to obtain the package name and version, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The dependencies listed are common machine learning and data processing libraries. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup configuration script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
