{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tempeh' Python package, intended to package and distribute the library with dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long_description; imports 'tempeh' module for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; setup process primarily handles package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads package description from file -> accesses 'tempeh' module attributes -> proceeds with package installation.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__' for package metadata, which assumes the 'tempeh' module correctly defines these attributes; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a README file for long description and uses attributes from the 'tempeh' module for package name and version. No untrusted data sources, user input, or suspicious code patterns are present. No suspicious behaviors or malicious code execution mechanisms are detected. The package dependencies are typical for a machine learning testing framework. No indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
