  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project named 'tempeh'.\n- The code reads a README.md file, imports the 'tempeh' module to access __name__ and __version__, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, well-understood parameters.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external untrusted data sources are mentioned or detected.\n- Dependencies are typical for a machine learning framework and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 and security risk of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any code that could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated.\n- The use of 'tempeh.__name__' and 'tempeh.__version__' assumes these attributes are properly defined in the 'tempeh' module, which is standard practice.\n- No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, network activity, or other malicious behaviors.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The reliance on 'tempeh' module attributes for package metadata is safe only if the module is trusted and well-maintained, but that is outside the scope of this script's security analysis.\n- The script is static and straightforward; no signs of supply chain attack vectors or malicious payloads.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The 'malware' score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The 'obfuscated' score is 0, which is accurate.\n- The 'securityRisk' score is 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports are thorough and align with my analysis. The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious features.",
