{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'tempeh' project, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md'; imports 'tempeh' module to access '__name__' and '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no network or file operations beyond reading README.",
  "flows": "Reads README -> imports 'tempeh' -> passes attributes to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script, performing static package configuration. It relies on 'tempeh' module attributes for metadata, which is standard. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling is present. The dependencies are common for ML frameworks. The code is straightforward and aligns with best practices, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. All signals indicate a safe package setup process.",
