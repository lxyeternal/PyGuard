{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'tempeh' Python project, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Importing 'tempeh' module to access its __name__ and __version__ attributes; reading README.md for long description; list of dependencies in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code; setup parameters are static.",
  "flows": "Imported 'tempeh' attributes are used to populate package name and version; dependencies are statically specified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. No signs of obfuscation or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for Python packaging. It imports the 'tempeh' module to dynamically set package name and version, reads a README file for description, and specifies dependencies for the package. All code is static and conventional for Python package setup. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical and benign setup configuration script for a Python package. No malicious activity or security concerns are identified.",
