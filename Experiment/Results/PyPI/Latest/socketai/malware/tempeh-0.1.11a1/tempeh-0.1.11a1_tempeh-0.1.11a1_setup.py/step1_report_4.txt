{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package called 'tempeh', intended to be installed via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; imports 'tempeh' module to access its name and version; no external input or untrusted data sources present.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup' to install the package and its dependencies; no suspicious sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content, imports package metadata, and calls setup() with static data; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscation or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' and 'tempeh', reading a README file, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. All data used is static or derived from known package metadata. No external inputs or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It securely defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
