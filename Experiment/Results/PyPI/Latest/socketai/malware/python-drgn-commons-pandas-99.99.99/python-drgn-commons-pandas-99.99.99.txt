      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration of system information during package installation, posing significant privacy and security risks. While no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, the behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the overall assessment indicates a high security concern due to privacy invasion and unauthorized data transmission."
