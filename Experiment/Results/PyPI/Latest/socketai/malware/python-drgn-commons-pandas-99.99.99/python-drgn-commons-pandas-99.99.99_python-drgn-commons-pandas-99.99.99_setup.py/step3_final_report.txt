{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (OS details, hostname, user, IP, current directory) during package installation and transmits this data to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for system info, os.system() executing curl command for data transmission",
  "sinks": "The os.system() call executing a curl POST request to the Slack webhook URL",
  "flows": "System info gathered via os.popen() flows into variables, then into a JSON payload, which is sent via os.system() executing curl to external URL",
  "anomalies": "Automatic, silent exfiltration of system info during package install without user notification; hardcoded webhook URL; use of os.popen() and os.system() without validation or error handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs platform-specific system info collection and exfiltrates this data during installation via a hardcoded webhook, indicating privacy-invasive behavior. No obfuscation or destructive payloads are present. The exfiltration occurs covertly, which is suspicious. The data flow from system commands to external transmission is straightforward, with no safeguards or user consent. The behavior aligns with malicious privacy invasion, justifying high security and malware risk scores. The code's actions are consistent across reports, and the assigned scores (malware ~0.7, security risk ~0.8, obfuscated 0) are appropriate given the behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration of system information during package installation, posing significant privacy and security risks. While no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present, the behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the overall assessment indicates a high security concern due to privacy invasion and unauthorized data transmission.",
