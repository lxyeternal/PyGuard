{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook, likely for monitoring or logging purposes during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to gather system info, hostname, whoami, and curl command to obtain public IP, as well as the final os.system() call that posts data to Slack.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a curl command that sends collected data to an external URL, and os.popen() calls that execute system commands to gather sensitive system information.",
  "flows": "System commands (sources) via os.popen() collect data; the data is stored in variables; then, these variables are interpolated into a curl command executed by os.system() (sink), transmitting data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code captures potentially sensitive information (hostname, user info, IP addresses) during installation and exfiltrates it unconditionally to an external URL. The URL appears to be a Slack webhook, which could be used for monitoring or malicious exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the setup process, overriding the run() method of the install class. It gathers system information (OS details, hostname, user, IP addresses) using subprocess commands. It then constructs and executes a curl command to send this data to an external webhook. The data exfiltration occurs during package installation without user consent or transparency. The URL used appears to be a Slack webhook, which could be used for benign logging or malicious data collection. The use of os.popen() and os.system() to execute commands and send data indicates a clear data exfiltration behavior. No other malicious payloads, backdoors, or harmful actions are present, but the exfiltration of system information at install time without disclosure is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is its unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive system information during package installation. This behavior is suspicious and could be malicious, especially if used without user knowledge or consent. The code does not perform harmful actions on the system itself but violates privacy principles by exfiltrating data to an external service. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent related to data exfiltration.",
