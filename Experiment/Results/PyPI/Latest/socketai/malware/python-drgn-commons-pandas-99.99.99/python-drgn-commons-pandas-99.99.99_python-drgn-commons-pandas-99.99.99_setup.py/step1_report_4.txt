  "purpose": "Custom installation script for a Python package that collects system information and posts it to a Slack webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system info with os.popen('uname -a'), 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'whoami', 'hostname', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist'; Reading current directory with os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "os.popen, os.system, subprocess calls (curl POST request) that send collected data to an external URL (Slack webhook)",
  "flows": "System info and user data collected via os.popen/os.system flow directly into a POST request via os.system, which transmits data to an external server",
  "anomalies": "The code captures system info, user identity, hostname, and IP addresses and sends this data to an external Slack webhook during installation, which is unusual behavior for package setup scripts and could be used for tracking or data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, during the run method, gathers various system details based on the platform (macOS, Linux, Windows). It reads OS info, current directory, IP configuration, and user identity. Then, it constructs a message with these details and posts it to a Slack webhook URL via os.system. This behavior is atypical for package installation and raises privacy and security concerns due to unsolicited data transmission. No hardcoded credentials are present other than the webhook URL, which is external. The data collected could be used for tracking or reconnaissance, and the POST request to an external URL without user consent is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects detailed system information during installation and transmits it to an external Slack webhook, which is suspicious behavior outside normal package setup processes. It may be used for tracking or data exfiltration, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive intent.",
