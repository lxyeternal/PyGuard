  "purpose": "Custom installation script for a Python package that gathers system information and sends it via a webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen('uname -a'), os.popen('ifconfig'), os.popen('curl ifconfig.me'), os.popen('systeminfo'), os.popen('ipconfig'), os.popen('tasklist'), os.popen('whoami'), os.popen('hostname')",
  "sinks": "os.system('curl -X POST ...') - sending collected system info to a remote URL",
  "flows": "Data from system commands (sources) are collected and then embedded into a JSON payload sent via an HTTP POST request (sink) to a Slack webhook",
  "anomalies": "Use of system commands to collect potentially sensitive system information; sending this info to an external URL without validation or user consent; hardcoded webhook URL; execution of multiple system commands during installation; no clear justification for data collection",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon running, gathers various system details depending on the OS platform. It collects hostname, current directory, OS details, network configurations, and the output of 'whoami'. It then constructs a JSON payload containing these details and posts it to a Slack webhook URL using 'os.system'. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which could allow data exfiltration. The code executes during package installation, which could be unexpected and intrusive. No input validation or user notification is present. The data collection appears comprehensive, possibly to monitor or track system information surreptitiously.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits potentially malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information during installation and exfiltrating it to an external webhook without user consent. It is suspicious due to its covert data collection and transmission, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
