{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to gather system information and send it via a Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'sys.platform', 'os.popen' commands for 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'whoami', 'hostname', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', and 'tasklist'.",
  "sinks": "The code sends data to a Slack webhook URL using 'os.system' with 'curl' and formatted JSON payload.",
  "flows": "Sources like 'os.popen' and command outputs are collected into variables, which are then interpolated into a JSON payload sent via 'curl' to the Slack webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes system commands to gather detailed system info and then transmits this data externally without user consent. The use of 'os.popen' and 'os.system' to send system info to an external URL is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, executes platform-specific commands to retrieve system details such as OS info, network configuration, and current user details. It then composes a message with these details and posts it to a Slack webhook URL. The information transmitted includes hostname, current user, public IP address, and other system information, which could be used for reconnaissance or privacy invasion. The data flow involves collecting system info and then sending it externally without any apparent user permission or disclosure. No malicious payload or destructive actions are observed beyond data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code exfiltrates system information during package installation to an external Slack webhook, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent or privacy violation. It does not perform harmful actions beyond data collection and transmission, but the behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
