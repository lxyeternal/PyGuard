{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'wweb3' and customizes the installation process with a specific install command.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.name), loads encrypted data for decryption, and imports external modules ('requests', 'fernet') during execution.",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), network request capabilities via requests module, and decryption process which could potentially load malicious code.",
  "flows": "Environment check (os.name) triggers import and execution of decrypted code, which is executed dynamically via exec(). Decryption key and encrypted data are hardcoded and decrypted during install.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload decrypted at runtime and executed with exec(), which is a significant anomaly. The long description appears as random characters, possibly obfuscation. The custom install class dynamically runs code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script that includes a custom installation class. During installation on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts and executes code dynamically using a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is run with exec(), which is a high-risk behavior, potentially executing malicious code hidden within the encrypted data. The encrypted string and the use of exec() indicate obfuscation and possible malicious intent. The long description is nonsensical, suggesting an attempt to evade simple detection. All external modules ('requests', 'fernet') are declared as setup requirements but are used directly in code execution, creating a risk of remote code execution during install. Overall, these behaviors are highly suspicious and typical of malicious package obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior through dynamic code execution of decrypted payload during installation, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent. The obfuscated, encrypted payload and use of exec() point to a potential backdoor or malicious functionality embedded in the package. It should be considered dangerous and unsafe to install or distribute.",
