  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'wweb3', including custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing modules like os, requests, and fernet, executing decrypted code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, importing potentially malicious modules, network requests via requests (though not explicitly used here).",
  "flows": "Environment check (os.name) -> import requests and Fernet -> decrypt and execute code via exec() on Windows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of encrypted payload executed at install time, the decryption key and cipher text are hardcoded, use of exec() with decrypted code, obfuscation in variable names and description strings, no visible legitimate purpose for decrypting and executing code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install class that runs during package installation. If on Windows (nt), it imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload, and executes it dynamically with exec(). The code is obfuscated through the use of unusual class names, variable names, and long, meaningless strings. The hardcoded encryption key and cipher text suggest intentional concealment of malicious or unwanted behavior. The decrypted code could perform any action, including malicious activities like system modification, data theft, or establishing backdoors. No other legitimate setup functions justify this behavior, and the encrypted payload remains unknown, representing a high security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious activity: it decrypts and executes code during installation on Windows systems, likely as a backdoor or malicious payload. The obfuscation and hardcoded encrypted data strongly indicate malicious intent. The package should be considered highly dangerous and avoided.",
