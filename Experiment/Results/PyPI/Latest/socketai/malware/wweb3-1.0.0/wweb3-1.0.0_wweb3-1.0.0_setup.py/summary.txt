  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by decrypting and executing arbitrary code during installation on Windows, with obfuscation and hardcoded payloads indicating intent to conceal malicious activity. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the package should be considered highly dangerous and avoided."
