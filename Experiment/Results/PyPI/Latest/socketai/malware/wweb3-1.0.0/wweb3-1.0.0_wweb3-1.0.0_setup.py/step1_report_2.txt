{
  "purpose": "Set up and install a Python package named 'wweb3' with custom post-install behavior that decrypts and executes embedded code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.name), importing modules (requests, fernet), and decrypting embedded encrypted data.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decrypted code, potentially malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "os.name check → import requests & Fernet → decrypt & execute code via exec()",
  "anomalies": "Encrypted payload within the code, use of exec() on decrypted data, conditional code execution based on OS, obfuscated variable and class names, suspiciously long and random strings for version and descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is primarily standard, but it contains a custom install command class that, when run on Windows, imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' from 'cryptography', then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string and executes it via exec(). The presence of embedded encrypted code that is decrypted at runtime and executed is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity. The code does not specify where the decrypted payload comes from but executing arbitrary decrypted code poses a high security risk. The use of obfuscated class names and long random strings further suggests intent to hide malicious behavior. The script does not reveal any benign purpose beyond installing a package; the main malicious activity is within the run() method, executing code decrypted from embedded data.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a highly suspicious behavior: on Windows systems, it decrypts and executes hidden code during installation, which could be malicious. This pattern suggests potential malicious intent, such as executing backdoors, stealing data, or other malicious actions. The obfuscation and encrypted payload strongly imply malicious or at least suspicious activity.",
