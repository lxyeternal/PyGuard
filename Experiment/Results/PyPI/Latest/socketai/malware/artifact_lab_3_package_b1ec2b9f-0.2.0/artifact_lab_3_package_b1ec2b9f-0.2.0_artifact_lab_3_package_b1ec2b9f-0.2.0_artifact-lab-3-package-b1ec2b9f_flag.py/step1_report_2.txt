  "flows": "Environment variables -> Base64 encoding -> HTTP POST request to external server",
  "anomalies": "Encoding entire environment variables and sending them to an external URL without any validation or user input; the target URL appears suspicious and may be used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code captures the entire environment variables as a string, encodes it in ASCII, then base64 encodes this data, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded URL. The URL is on a suspicious domain, which may be used for malicious purposes like data exfiltration. The code does not sanitize or restrict what is being sent, and sending environment data externally without consent is suspicious. There are no other functions, inputs, or logic that modify or restrict this behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be exfiltrating environment variables to an external server, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of a suspicious URL and the lack of any validation or user consent strongly indicate malicious intent.",
