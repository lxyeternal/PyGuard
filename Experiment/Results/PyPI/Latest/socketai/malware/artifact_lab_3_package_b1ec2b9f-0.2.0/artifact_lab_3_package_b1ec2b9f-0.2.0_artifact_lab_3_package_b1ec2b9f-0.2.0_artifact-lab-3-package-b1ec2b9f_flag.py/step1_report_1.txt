  "purpose": "Collects environment variables, encodes them in base64, and sends them via HTTP POST request to an external URL.",

  "sinks": "requests.post to an external URL with encoded environment data",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> base64 encoding -> HTTP POST request to external domain",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes all environment variables and exfiltrates them to an external server without any validation or user interaction. The domain URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the entire environment variable set, encodes it in base64, and sends it to a remote server. This behavior indicates potential data exfiltration. The external URL looks suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes such as stealing environment secrets, credentials, or system info. No input validation or security checks are performed. The purpose seems malicious or at least privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates environment variables to an external server without user consent, indicating malicious intent or privacy violation. The suspicious domain further supports this concern.",
