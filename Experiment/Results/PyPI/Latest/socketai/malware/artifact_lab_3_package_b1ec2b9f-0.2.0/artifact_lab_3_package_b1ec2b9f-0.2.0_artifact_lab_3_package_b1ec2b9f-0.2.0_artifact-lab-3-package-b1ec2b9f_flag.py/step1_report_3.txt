{
  "purpose": "The code gathers environment variables, encodes them in base64, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables using os.environ",
  "sinks": "Sending data over the network via requests.post to an external domain",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are encoded and sent directly to the external server (sink) in a POST request",
  "anomalies": "No user input or untrusted data sources are involved; the code serializes all environment variables and exfiltrates them to an external URL, which is suspicious. The domain appears malicious or suspicious. The encoding process may be used to obscure data. The URL is non-standard and likely malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves all environment variables as a string, encodes this string in ASCII, then base64 encodes the bytes, and finally sends the encoded data to a suspicious external server via an HTTP POST request with a 2-second timeout. The data exfiltration of environment variables indicates malicious intent, potentially stealing sensitive information. The target URL is non-standard and suggests malicious or tracking behavior. There are no apparent safeguards, user input handling, or validation, making this behavior potentially harmful.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs malicious data exfiltration by collecting environment variables and sending them to a suspicious external server, which is indicative of malicious behavior. It could be used for information theft or unauthorized surveillance.",
