  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files; specific data sources are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands; no explicit sinks are identified as malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through functions or variables, but no suspicious source-to-sink pathways are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code structure appears typical without unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows standard Python coding practices without obfuscation or malicious constructs. No suspicious network calls, data exfiltration routines, or dangerous system manipulations are detected. The code's purpose aligns with benign functionality, and no anomalies indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It is a typical Python script with standard practices, posing no security threats based on the provided snippet.",
