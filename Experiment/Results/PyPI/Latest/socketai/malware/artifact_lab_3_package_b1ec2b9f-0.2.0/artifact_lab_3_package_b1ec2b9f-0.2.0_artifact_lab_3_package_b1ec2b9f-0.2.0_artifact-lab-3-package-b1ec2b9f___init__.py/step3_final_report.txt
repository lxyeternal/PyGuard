  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "eval/exec statements, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation routines, external data reads",
  "sinks": "network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "source indicators (eval/exec, secrets) leading to potential malicious actions (network, file system)",
  "anomalies": "use of eval/exec, high obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, ambiguous code purpose",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits eval/exec usage and obfuscation, indicating potential malicious intent. Hardcoded secrets further increase suspicion. Absence of code or benign descriptions in other reports justify zero scores. The high confidence (0.8) and scores (malware 0.7, obfuscated 0.7, securityRisk 0.75) for Report 1 are justified by these indicators. Benign reports correctly have zero scores. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with no adjustments necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 demonstrates high suspicion of malicious activity due to eval/exec, obfuscation, and secrets, warranting high malware and risk scores. Other reports lack code or show benign behavior, justified with zero scores. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described behaviors and indicators.",
