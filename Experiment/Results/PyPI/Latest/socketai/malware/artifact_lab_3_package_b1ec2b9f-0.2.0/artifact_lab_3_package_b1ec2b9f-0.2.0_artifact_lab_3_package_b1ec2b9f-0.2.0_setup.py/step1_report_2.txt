  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it specifies package requirements and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed; no potential data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code primarily defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions, defines package name, version, and dependencies, and calls 'setup()' with this information. It appears to be a standard, straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious activity. The dependencies specified are common and benign. There are no embedded or hidden commands, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious code paths.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
