{
  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'setup()' function parameters, including package name, version, packages via find_packages(), and dependencies via install_requires.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code does not execute external code or handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing setuptools, defining package metadata, and specifying dependencies, with no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports 'setuptools', specifies package name, version, and dependencies, and uses 'find_packages()' to locate packages. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic execution. Dependencies are standard and well-known. No external inputs or data sinks are involved. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and minimal security risk score (around 0.0 to 0.1) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
