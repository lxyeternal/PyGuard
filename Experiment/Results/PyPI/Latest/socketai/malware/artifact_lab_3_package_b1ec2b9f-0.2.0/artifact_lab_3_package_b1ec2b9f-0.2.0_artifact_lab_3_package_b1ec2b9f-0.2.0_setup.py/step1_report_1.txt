  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for a Python package, specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version) and dependencies from the 'setup()' function arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data outputs or untrusted data handling in this script.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining package metadata and dependencies into executing the 'setup()' function, which registers the package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or unusual patterns are present. Use of 'find_packages()' and explicit dependencies is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python projects. It imports 'setuptools' functions, specifies package metadata, and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as malicious code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The dependencies listed are standard and safe. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup configuration script for a Python package. No malicious or security issues are detected.",
