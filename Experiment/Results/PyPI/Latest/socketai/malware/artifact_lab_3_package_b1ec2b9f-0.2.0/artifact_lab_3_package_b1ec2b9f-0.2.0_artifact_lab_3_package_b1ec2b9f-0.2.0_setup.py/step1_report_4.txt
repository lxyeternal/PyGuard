{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'artifact-lab-3-package-b1ec2b9f', specifying dependencies and package information.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package name, version, and dependencies; uses 'find_packages()' to locate package modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted input or data sinks; it is a setup script that primarily defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists; the script only defines static configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py structure with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and uses 'setup()' with static parameters for package configuration. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling is present. The 'install_requires' list specifies a versioned dependency on 'requests'. The code appears straightforward and conventional for a setup script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and benign, serving the purpose of defining package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
