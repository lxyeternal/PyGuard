  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The 'setup.py' script reads package configuration, version, and dependencies.",
  "targets": "The 'install_requires' list indicates external dependencies that will be installed.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; dependencies are specified for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; the code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies, with no dynamic code, obfuscated parts, or suspicious logic. It simply declares the package name, version, dependencies, and finds packages automatically. There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data, nor any anomalies such as hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only specifies package info and dependencies.",
