  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- It imports 'setuptools', defines package metadata, dependencies, and uses 'find_packages()'.\n- No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- Dependencies are standard (requests), with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The reports uniformly conclude benign intent, which aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as a typical setup.py with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, confirms standard setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard setup script. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1).\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n\n**Analysis:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 suggests minimal concern, perhaps due to the dependency installation. Since dependencies can sometimes be vectors if malicious, but here they are standard, this is acceptable.\n\n**Justification:** No actual malicious activity or vulnerabilities are present. The score seems reasonable, though perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, confirms benign, standard code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0, confidence=1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Analysis:** Similar to Report 3, the slight securityRisk score reflects the potential for dependency issues but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0.0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0.0, with a couple of reports assigning 0.1, which is reasonable given the dependency installation, but still minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations & Final Justification**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- The slight securityRisk of 0.1 in some reports is justified due to dependency installation but does not indicate a real threat.\n- No changes needed; all assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0  \n**Security risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 (most conservative estimate: 0.0, given no actual risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The scores assigned across reports are reasonable and justified.",
