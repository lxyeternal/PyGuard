  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables and system info to an external server during package installation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and consistent with this behavior. No obfuscation is present. This code constitutes a serious security threat and should be flagged for review and remediation."
