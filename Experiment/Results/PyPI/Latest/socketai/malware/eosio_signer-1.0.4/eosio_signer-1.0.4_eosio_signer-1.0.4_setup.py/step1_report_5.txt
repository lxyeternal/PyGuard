  "purpose": "Custom post-installation script to collect environment variables and system information, then upload data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA), system commands (hostname, whoami, ifconfig), file operations (/tmp/r).",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing shell commands, curl command sending data over the network.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> extract_once() -> os.system commands and file write -> curl POST request to remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "Uses environment variables directly in shell commands and data written to a temporary file, which could be exploited if variables are manipulated. The remote server IP (61.28.229.27) is hardcoded, and data is sent without validation or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that runs after package installation. It retrieves sensitive environment variables and executes system commands to gather system info. The data, along with environment variable values, is written to a file and then uploaded to a hardcoded IP address via a curl POST request. The presence of environment variable usage in shell commands, combined with the data exfiltration over network, raises security concerns. No obfuscation is present; code is straightforward but suspicious due to potential data theft and remote data exfiltration. The code's malicious potential hinges on the intent behind sending data to the specified IP, which could be used for unauthorized monitoring or data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears designed to collect environment and system data and send it to a remote server, which could be malicious if used without user consent. It exhibits suspicious behavior such as environment variable misuse and network exfiltration, indicating a high security risk.",
