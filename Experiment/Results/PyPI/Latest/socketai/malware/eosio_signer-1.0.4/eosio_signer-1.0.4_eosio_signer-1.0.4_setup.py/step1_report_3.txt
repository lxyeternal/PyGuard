{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package 'eosio_signer' with a custom post-installation command that executes system commands and sends data to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'BX_API_HOSTNAME', 'BX_PRIVATE_KEY', 'BX_API_METADATA'; system commands via os.system; reading environment variables.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing hostname, whoami, ifconfig; writing to /tmp/r; curl POST request to a remote IP address.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are gathered and embedded into a string written to /tmp/r; system commands execute system info collection; then /tmp/r content is uploaded via curl to a remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for executing system commands and data exfiltration; writing sensitive data and environment info into a temporary file; hardcoded remote IP address for data upload; reliance on environment variables that could be set maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom install command that, when run, retrieves environment variables likely containing sensitive data. It executes system commands to gather system information and appends environment data into a temporary file. Subsequently, it performs an HTTP POST to a suspicious IP address, uploading the collected data. The use of environment variables, combined with executing system commands and data exfiltration via curl, indicates malicious intent or at least malicious behavior, especially in a supply chain context. The code does not contain obfuscation but uses techniques that can facilitate covert data collection. The remote IP is not associated with any recognized service, raising suspicion. Overall, the code appears designed to collect potentially sensitive environment data and transmit it to an external server without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by gathering system information and exfiltrating it to a remote server during package installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. The presence of data exfiltration and the use of environment variables for sensitive data suggests a high security risk.",
