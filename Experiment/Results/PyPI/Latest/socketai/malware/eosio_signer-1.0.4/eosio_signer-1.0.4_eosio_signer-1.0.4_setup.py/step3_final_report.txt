{
  "purpose": "The code performs data exfiltration by collecting environment variables and system info during package installation and sending it to an external IP, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA), system commands (hostname, whoami, ifconfig), and the file /tmp/r.",
  "sinks": "The external IP address via curl command, which transmits collected data outside the system.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system info are gathered, written to /tmp/r, then transmitted via curl to external IP.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during installation, use of hardcoded IP, execution of system commands, and writing sensitive info to a temporary file.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and executes system commands to gather system info, then writes this info along with environment variables to /tmp/r. It then uses curl to POST this file to an external IP address. These actions occur during the package's install process, without user consent or notification. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but performs suspicious activities indicative of malicious behavior. The external IP is hardcoded, and the data transfer is unencrypted, increasing security concerns. The behavior aligns with supply chain attacks, backdoors, or data theft malware. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscation 0) are consistent with this analysis. The code's activity warrants high malware and security risk scores, justified by the active exfiltration of sensitive data, system info, and the potential for privacy violations or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables and system info to an external server during package installation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and consistent with this behavior. No obfuscation is present. This code constitutes a serious security threat and should be flagged for review and remediation.",
