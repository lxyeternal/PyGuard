  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the 'eosio_signer' package, including a custom post-installation script.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'BX_API_HOSTNAME', 'BX_PRIVATE_KEY', 'BX_API_METADATA'; os.system calls; file reading/writing /tmp/r.",
  "sinks": "os.system commands executing shell commands; HTTP POST request via curl; writing sensitive info and environment variables to a temporary file.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read, then data is written to /tmp/r; then a curl command posts this file to an external IP address.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with combined commands, including hostname, whoami, ifconfig; writing potentially sensitive environment variables to a temporary file; transmitting data via an external IP address without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script reads environment variables related to API credentials and metadata. It executes multiple shell commands via os.system, collecting system info and appending the environment variables to a temp file. It then posts this file to an external IP address using curl, which could leak sensitive data. The code is intended to run after package installation, potentially exfiltrating environment data without user consent. The use of os.system for executing shell commands and sending data externally is suspicious, especially given the hardcoded external endpoint. No obfuscation or encrypted code is present. The purpose appears to be data collection and exfiltration, possibly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system and environment data and exfiltrating it to an external server without user awareness. It leverages post-install scripts to run covert operations, indicating a high security risk. The overall risk score is high due to data exfiltration tactics and lack of transparency.",
