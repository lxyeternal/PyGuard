  "conclusion": "The cryptographic implementation appears legitimate; however, the embedded behavior of collecting system info and exfiltrating it to an external server is malicious and poses a significant security risk. The scores should reflect a high probability of malicious intent, with malware score around 0.8 and security risk around 0.9, due to the data exfiltration activity."
