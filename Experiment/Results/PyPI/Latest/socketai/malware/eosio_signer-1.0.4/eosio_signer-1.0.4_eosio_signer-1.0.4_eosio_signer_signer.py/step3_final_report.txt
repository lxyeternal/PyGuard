{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract interface for cryptographic signing operations, serving as a base class for subclasses implementing specific signing logic.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the class only declares abstract methods; the constructor accepts a parameter but does not process external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows; abstract method signatures indicate intended source-to-sink paths, but none are executed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the unused 'private_str' parameter in the constructor, which suggests incomplete implementation or a placeholder, but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a benign abstract base class with no executable logic, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The unused parameter 'private_str' is a minor anomaly, likely intended for subclasses or future extension. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "This is a safe, standard interface template for cryptographic signers with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor anomaly of the unused parameter does not impact security. Overall, the code is benign and should be considered secure.",
