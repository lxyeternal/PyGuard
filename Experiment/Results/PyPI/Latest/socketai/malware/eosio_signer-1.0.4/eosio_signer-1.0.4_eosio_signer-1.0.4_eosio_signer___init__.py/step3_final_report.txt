  "purpose": "Import the EOSIOKey class from a local module named key.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which reads the local module 'key' to access 'EOSIOKey'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with clear syntax and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, standard in Python projects, importing 'EOSIOKey' from a local module 'key'. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with high confidence scores (0.9-1). Malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk scores are minimal (0-0.1), consistent with the benign nature. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores are appropriate and align with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a safe, standard import statement with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
