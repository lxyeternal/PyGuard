  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports consistently indicate that the code is a simple import statement: `from .key import EOSIOKey`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns in any report.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying that this is a benign import statement.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The conclusion in each report aligns with the code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n   - Malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n   - This is consistent with the code snippet.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that, based solely on this line, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: benign import statements with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The consistent reporting and scoring support this conclusion.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code.\n- No adjustments needed; the current scoring and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
