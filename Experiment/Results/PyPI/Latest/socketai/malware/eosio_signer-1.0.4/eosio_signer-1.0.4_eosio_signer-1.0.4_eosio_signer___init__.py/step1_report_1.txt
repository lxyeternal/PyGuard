  "purpose": "Importing the EOSIOKey class from a local key module, likely for cryptographic or blockchain key management.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module named 'key'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this single line.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected in this line.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard import from a relative module, which is common in Python projects. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscated patterns, or security risks by itself. Since this is only a single line with a straightforward import, there is no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior. No sensitive data is accessed or transmitted at this point.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for a local module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe based on this isolated snippet.",
