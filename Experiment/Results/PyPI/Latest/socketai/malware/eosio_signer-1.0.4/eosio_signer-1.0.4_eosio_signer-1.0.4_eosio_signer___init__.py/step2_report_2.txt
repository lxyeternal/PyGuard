  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n1. **Code Presence and Validity**:\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .key import EOSIOKey` (or similar).\n- The code is a straightforward import from a local module, which is standard practice in Python projects.\n- There are no indications of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior.\n- They uniformly conclude that the code appears safe, which aligns with the code snippet.\n- No logical errors or misconceptions are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of an import statement.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable.\n- Confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- Import statements alone generally do not pose security risks unless combined with malicious code elsewhere.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:\n- All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n- Since the code is only an import, this is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts that this is a simple import.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code snippet.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment**:\n- The code snippet is a benign import statement.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering minimal risk in larger context, but based solely on this snippet, 0 is appropriate)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis import statement is safe, and no further action or concern is warranted based on this isolated code snippet.",
