  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential security sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks; only a class import.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that brings in the EOSIOKey class from a local module named 'key'. It does not process, read, or handle any untrusted data, nor does it execute any dynamic code or perform network operations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. Since this is just an import statement, it provides no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
