  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "eval/exec statements, hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, environment variable reads, network connections, base64 or other obfuscation patterns.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file writes, environment variable access, eval/exec execution points, data exfiltration pathways.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into eval/exec or data transmission functions, indicating potential malicious data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution via eval/exec, hardcoded secrets or credentials, suspicious URLs or network activity, base64 or other encoding schemes, inconsistent or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with suspicious patterns like eval/exec, hardcoded credentials, and network connections to suspicious domains. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent, especially when combined. Benign code lacks such patterns. The presence of obfuscation and hardcoded secrets increases suspicion. Scores are adjusted to reflect the severity: malware score increased from 0.3 to 0.6, security risk from 0.6 to 0.65, and obfuscation remains high. The analysis aligns with the scores, emphasizing the potential for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows significant indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded secrets. The adjusted scores better reflect the observed risks. Overall, the dependency should be treated with caution due to high suspicion of malicious intent.",
