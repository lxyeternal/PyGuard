  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static code in setup() parameters: name, version, packages, author, author_email, description, url, classifiers, python_requires, entry_points.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no network or file I/O within this script.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' are unprofessional and potentially malicious, but do not affect code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script using setuptools, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or dynamic behavior. The only notable anomalies are the unprofessional contact details, which could indicate malicious intent outside the code scope. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the code content. The security risk score is slightly elevated (~0.2-0.3) due to metadata concerns but no actual security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The package code is benign and standard; no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The primary concern is the suspicious metadata, which warrants caution but does not constitute a security threat within the code itself. Overall, the security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a modest risk score (~0.2-0.3).",
