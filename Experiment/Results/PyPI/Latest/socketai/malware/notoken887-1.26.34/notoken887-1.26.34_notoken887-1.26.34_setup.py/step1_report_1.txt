  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads package configuration details, package discovery via find_packages(), and entry point definition for console script.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no external network or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; standard packaging configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Author email 'hitler@gmail.com' is suspicious and unprofessional, potentially malicious or inappropriate; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, with typical fields such as name, version, packages, author, description, URL, classifiers, and entry points. The code does not contain dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The only notable concern is the email address used for the author, which is unprofessional and potentially malicious in intent. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is evident. The package appears to be a simple test library without hidden malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks other than an unprofessional author email. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues based on this script alone.",
