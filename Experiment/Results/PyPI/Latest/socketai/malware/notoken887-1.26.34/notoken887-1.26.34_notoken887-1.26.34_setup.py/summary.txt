  "conclusion": "The package code is benign and standard; no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The primary concern is the suspicious metadata, which warrants caution but does not constitute a security threat within the code itself. Overall, the security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a modest risk score (~0.2-0.3)."
