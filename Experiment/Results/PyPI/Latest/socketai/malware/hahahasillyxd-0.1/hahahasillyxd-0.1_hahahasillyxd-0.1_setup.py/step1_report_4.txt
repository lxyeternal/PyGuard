{
  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an MP3 file from a specific URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the internet via a curl command executed through PowerShell and also accesses the local filesystem to check for the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded MP3 file using PowerShell's Start-Process, which could be used to run arbitrary files if the download URL is malicious.",
  "flows": "Download command (source) via curl URL -> saved as 'b.mp3' -> executed with Start-Process (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an MP3 file from a remote URL and then automatically plays it without any validation or user consent. The URL appears to be a direct link to a media file on Discord, which could be used to deliver malicious content or payloads disguised as media. The use of PowerShell commands for download and execution during package installation is suspicious and atypical for legitimate packages.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the default install command to run a custom script. It constructs a PowerShell command to download an MP3 file from a Discord CDN link directly into the current working directory. It then immediately attempts to play this file using Start-Process, which could execute malicious or unwanted media files without user knowledge. The download URL could potentially host malicious payloads. The process lacks any verification, validation, or user consent prompts. This behavior indicates malicious intent, likely aiming to silently download and execute arbitrary content during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and automatically executing a media file from a remote source without user consent. This behavior can be used to deliver malicious payloads or compromise the host system. The package exhibits high malicious intent and security risk.",
