  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'hello' to the console.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code performs a benign print operation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code executes a straightforward print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single print statement with no input, external data, or network interactions. It is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code's simplicity confirms its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
