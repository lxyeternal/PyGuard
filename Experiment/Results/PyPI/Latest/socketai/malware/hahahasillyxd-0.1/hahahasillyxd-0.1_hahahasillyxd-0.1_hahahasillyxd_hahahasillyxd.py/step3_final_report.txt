  "purpose": "Simple print statement outputting 'hello'",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only outputs a static message",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with no input handling, external dependencies, or complex control flow. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no anomalies, and the code does not interact with sensitive sinks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and justified given the simplicity and benign intent of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
