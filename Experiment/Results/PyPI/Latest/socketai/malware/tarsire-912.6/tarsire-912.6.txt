      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a security concern. While the actual maliciousness depends on the content of 'main.py', the behavior itself warrants a high suspicion level. The current reports' scores are reasonable, but a slight increase in malware and risk scores is advisable to reflect the potential severity. Further review of 'main.py' is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert system info exfiltration to suspicious domains, with no obfuscation. It poses a high security risk due to privacy violations and potential malicious use. The malware score should be set around 0.75-0.8, and the risk score around 0.75-0.8, consistent with the behavior. Current scores in most reports are appropriate, but some underestimate malware severity. Overall, the code should be classified as malicious with high severity."
