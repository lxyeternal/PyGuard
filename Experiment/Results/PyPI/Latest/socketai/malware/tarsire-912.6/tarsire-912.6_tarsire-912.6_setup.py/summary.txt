  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a security concern. While the actual maliciousness depends on the content of 'main.py', the behavior itself warrants a high suspicion level. The current reports' scores are reasonable, but a slight increase in malware and risk scores is advisable to reflect the potential severity. Further review of 'main.py' is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."
