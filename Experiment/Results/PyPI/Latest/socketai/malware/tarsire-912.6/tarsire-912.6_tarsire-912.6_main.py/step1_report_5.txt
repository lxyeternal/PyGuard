  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded external URLs with suspicious domain names, dynamic URL construction, no user consent or transparency, potential data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It then constructs URLs pointing to seemingly suspicious or malicious domains and sends system information as URL parameters. The code includes exception handling for network requests. The URLs and data transmission appear designed for covert data exfiltration or tracking without user awareness. The code does not perform any malicious actions like modifying files or executing hidden commands but does transmit potentially sensitive system info to external servers, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect and transmit system data to suspicious external servers without user consent, indicating potentially malicious intent related to data exfiltration or tracking. No direct malicious payloads like backdoors or damaging actions are present, but the behavior is concerning.",
