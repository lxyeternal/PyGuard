  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - makes HTTP requests to external servers with system info as URL parameters",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) is gathered, combined with a random number, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded external URLs that appear suspicious and domain names that do not match typical legitimate services. The code does not handle or sanitize input, and it unconditionally sends data to multiple external servers. The purpose of these requests is unclear and could be used for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system information such as hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number to differentiate requests. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending system info as URL parameters. The URLs are accessed via urllib.request.urlopen(), with responses read and logged. The external domains are potentially malicious or used for tracking, and the code runs unconditionally in the main block, which suggests an intent to exfiltrate data or track users without consent. No obfuscation or complex code patterns are present, but the behavior is suspicious due to external network requests with system info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious or used for tracking, as it collects system data and sends it to suspicious external URLs without user consent. The network activity and data collection indicate a security concern, warranting further investigation or blocking.",
