  "purpose": "The script collects system information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to several external URLs, possibly for tracking or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sending HTTP requests with system data embedded in URL",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current path, random number) from sources → URL construction → HTTP request to external server (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple external domains with suspicious and obfuscated-looking URLs; data is sent unencrypted via GET parameters; no user consent or transparency; the purpose appears to be covert data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system identifiers and a random number, then constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious domains, and makes HTTP GET requests to them. These requests include system details as URL parameters, which could be used for tracking or malicious monitoring. The external URLs are suspicious and appear to be part of a malicious infrastructure. The code does not process responses beyond logging, and there is no user interaction or explicit permission. The use of random numbers and URL encoding for system data suggests an intent for covert data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform covert data exfiltration by sending system information to malicious domains without user consent. It is likely malicious given the suspicious URLs, data collection behavior, and lack of transparency.",
