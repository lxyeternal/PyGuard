  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert system info exfiltration to suspicious domains, with no obfuscation. It poses a high security risk due to privacy violations and potential malicious use. The malware score should be set around 0.75-0.8, and the risk score around 0.75-0.8, consistent with the behavior. Current scores in most reports are appropriate, but some underestimate malware severity. Overall, the code should be classified as malicious with high severity."
