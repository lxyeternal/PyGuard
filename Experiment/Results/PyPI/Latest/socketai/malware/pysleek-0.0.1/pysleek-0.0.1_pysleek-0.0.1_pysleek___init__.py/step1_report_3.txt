{
  "purpose": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL and then executes it silently.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/zwerve.exe' used in curl.exe command; the current working directory for output path",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via PowerShell's Start-Process",
  "flows": "Download command reads data from the URL; the file is saved locally; then the code executes the saved executable",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes an external executable without validation, which is suspicious. No checksums or signature validation are performed. The URL is a raw GitHub link that could host malicious payload. The process is automated with no user prompts, potentially facilitating malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script constructs a command to download an executable from a GitHub raw URL and saves it as 'zwerve.exe' in the current working directory. It uses PowerShell's curl.exe for the download, which may be suspicious if not expected. After downloading, it checks if the file exists and then silently runs the executable. This pattern resembles typical behavior of malware loaders or dropper scripts. The lack of validation, such as checksum verification or user confirmation, increases the risk. The code could be used maliciously to download and run malware without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is potentially malicious as it downloads and executes a remote executable without validation or user consent. This pattern is commonly associated with malware droppers or malicious installers. Due to the remote code execution and lack of safeguards, it should be regarded as high risk.",
