  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to automatic, unvalidated remote download and silent execution. The behavior aligns with typical malware delivery mechanisms. The scores of 0.9 for malware and 0.9 for security risk are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior."
