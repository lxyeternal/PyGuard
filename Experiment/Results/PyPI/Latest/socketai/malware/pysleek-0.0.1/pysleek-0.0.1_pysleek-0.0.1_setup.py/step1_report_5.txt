  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with static, hardcoded package metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, environment variable usage, network calls, or code execution. No potential for malicious behavior or sabotage is detected. The author field contains a potentially suspicious username, but it does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward package setup configuration without any malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply defines package metadata for distribution.",
