  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'pysleek' with static metadata.",
  "sources": "Static strings assigned to name, version, author, description, and packages parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or input handling present; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual author string 'skibidiohiosigma123' and description set to 'None', which are atypical but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools with static, hardcoded values. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The author string's oddity does not imply malicious intent. The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware scores are appropriately zero; the obfuscated scores are zero; the security risk scores are minimal (0.1) in some reports due to the unusual author string but do not indicate actual threats. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The minor concern over the author string does not justify increased security risk. All reports' scoring and conclusions are consistent and appropriate.",
