  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the Python project 'pysleek'.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters: name, version, author, description, packages.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The author field contains a seemingly random or non-standard string 'skibidiohiosigma123', but this alone is not malicious. The description is 'None', which is unusual but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata without any input validation or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or potentially malicious code segments are present. The author string appears unconventional but does not indicate malicious intent. The setup script is straightforward, serving its purpose of package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The unusual author string warrants minimal concern but does not impact security.",
