  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging and distributing the 'pysleek' Python module.",
  "sources": "Constants defining package metadata (name, version, author, description, packages list).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; standard setup invocation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration data used.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sources or sinks. The author field contains a simple username, and description is 'None', indicating minimal metadata. The structure follows standard packaging conventions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be legitimate package metadata configuration.",
