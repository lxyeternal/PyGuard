      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, depending on 'main.py'. The scores assigned are appropriate, but higher caution is warranted given the behavior. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the malware likelihood is non-negligible if 'main.py' contains harmful code."

      "conclusion": "The script functions as a covert data exfiltration or fingerprinting tool, exhibiting behaviors associated with malicious surveillance but lacking direct malware payloads. The activity warrants security review but should not be classified as outright malware. The high suspicion is justified by external communication to suspicious domains and silent data transmission, though the code's core logic is primarily information gathering and exfiltration."
