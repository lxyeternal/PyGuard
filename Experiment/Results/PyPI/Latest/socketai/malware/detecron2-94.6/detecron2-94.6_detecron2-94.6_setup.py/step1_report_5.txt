  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'detecron2' package, including a custom installation step that calls a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' module inside the custom run method of the install class.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' from 'main' module during installation process.",
  "flows": "The installation process triggers the custom 'run' method, which then imports and executes 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The 'run' method executes 'main()' unconditionally during installation, which could execute arbitrary code during setup. No explicit safeguards or validation of 'main' are present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, upon running, imports and executes 'main()' from the 'main' module. This behavior can be used to run arbitrary code during package installation, which is suspicious. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The act of executing 'main()' during installation is potentially malicious if 'main' contains malicious code or unwanted behavior. Overall, the pattern indicates a potential for malicious behavior or unwanted side-effects during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code's key concern is executing 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. While no explicit malicious code is visible, this pattern is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
