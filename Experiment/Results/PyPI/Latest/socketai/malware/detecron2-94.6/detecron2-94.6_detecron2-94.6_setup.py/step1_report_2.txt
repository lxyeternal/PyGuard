{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'detecron2' Python package that customizes the installation process to run a main function after installation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'setuptools', 'install' class, and 'main' module within the 'run' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function imported from 'main' module, executed during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method calls 'install.run(self)', then imports 'main' and executes 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes a function 'main()' from an external module immediately after installation, which is unconventional and potentially risky. No evidence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that extends 'install' and overrides the 'run' method. After standard installation procedures, it imports and executes 'main()' from the 'main' module. This behavior means that upon package installation, some code within 'main.py' will automatically run, which could be used maliciously to execute arbitrary code without user consent. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are evident within this script. The primary concern is the execution of arbitrary code during install, which could be exploited if 'main.py' contains malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a custom install step that runs external code ('main()') automatically upon package installation. While this is not inherently malicious, it is unconventional and can be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main.py' is malicious. No direct malware signatures or obfuscated code are present, but the automatic execution during installation poses a security concern.",
