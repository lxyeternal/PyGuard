  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, depending on 'main.py'. The scores assigned are appropriate, but higher caution is warranted given the behavior. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the malware likelihood is non-negligible if 'main.py' contains harmful code."
