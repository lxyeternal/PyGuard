  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation command that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and custom install class; the 'main' function imported and called in run() method.",
  "sinks": "The call to main() in the custom run() method; potential execution of arbitrary code within main().",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method executes, calling main() from main.py, which could perform arbitrary actions.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes main() unconditionally during install, which is unusual and potentially malicious if main() performs harmful actions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Python package with specified metadata and dependencies. The key unusual aspect is the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class that overrides the install process to call 'main()' from main.py after installation. If 'main()' contains malicious code or performs harmful actions, this could compromise the system. No other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The behavior depends heavily on the content of main.py, which is not provided, but the act of executing main() at install time is a red flag for potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the invocation of main() during installation, which could allow malicious behavior if main() is harmful. Without knowing main.py, the risk cannot be definitively assessed, but the pattern suggests potential malicious intent.",
