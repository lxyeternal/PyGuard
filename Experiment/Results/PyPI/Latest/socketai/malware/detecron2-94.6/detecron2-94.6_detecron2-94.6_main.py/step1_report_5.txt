  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data encoded in base64 to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network info",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls with constructed URLs sending encoded system data",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is collected, encoded, and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits potentially sensitive system data to external servers without any authentication, encryption, or user consent; URLs appear suspicious and controlled externally; use of base64 encoding may be an obfuscation attempt, but not malicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identification data including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. The MAC addresses are retrieved differently per OS and then encoded in base64. The data is then sent via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs, which appear suspicious and could be used for tracking or data exfiltration. No malicious payload, backdoors, or malicious behaviors like executing arbitrary code, data theft beyond system info, or network malicious activity (e.g., malware delivery, reverse shells) are explicitly present. The code appears to be a form of fingerprinting or tracking mechanism. Although suspicious due to data transmission without user consent, there is no direct malware or malicious intent detected beyond potential privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system info collection and transmits it covertly to external servers. While this indicates a privacy concern and potential misuse, there is no clear evidence of malicious payload or malware. It may be used for tracking or fingerprinting, but it does not exhibit malicious behavior or exploit vulnerabilities.",
