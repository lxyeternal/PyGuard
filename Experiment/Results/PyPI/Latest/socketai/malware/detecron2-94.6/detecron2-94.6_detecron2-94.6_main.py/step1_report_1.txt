{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads MAC addresses, random.randint() for generating a number, and base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with embedded system info as query parameters.",
  "flows": "System info is collected from sources (platform, getpass, os, MAC retrieval, random number, base64 encoding) and then appended as URL parameters in HTTP requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external domains possibly for data exfiltration. No obvious hardcoded credentials but the URLs seem suspicious and used for data collection. No evident obfuscation, but URL patterns and base64 encoding suggest covert data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific data such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encoding MACs in base64. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends this data via HTTP GET requests. The URLs are obscure and may be malicious, designed for tracking or exfiltration. The code does not perform malicious actions on the system but quietly transmits sensitive information. No obfuscation or malware code like reverse shells or data theft functions is present. The code appears to be a data collection or tracking script possibly used for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily functions as a system info logger transmitting data to external domains, which may be malicious depending on context. It does not perform destructive or malicious actions but could be part of a surveillance or data exfiltration chain. Overall, suspicious due to data collection and external communication with obscure URLs.",
