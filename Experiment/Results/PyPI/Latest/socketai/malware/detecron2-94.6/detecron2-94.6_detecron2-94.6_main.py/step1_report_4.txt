{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and sends this data to predefined URLs as query parameters.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen().",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is gathered and encoded, then appended as URL parameters in HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs targeted are suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of base64 encoding of MAC addresses suggests obfuscation of data. The script does not process responses and silently ignores exceptions, which is typical for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code collects environment and hardware data, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends this information to multiple external servers. The URLs are obfuscated and suspicious, indicating possible data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities. The data collection is straightforward without validation or sanitization, and network requests are made silently, which is consistent with malicious data harvesting. The code does not perform any malicious actions beyond data transmission but is designed to stealthily transmit potentially sensitive system info to external entities.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be used for covert data collection and exfiltration, indicative of malicious or reconnaissance behavior. The use of suspicious URLs and silent network communication reinforces this suspicion.",
