{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to add a specified executable to Windows startup, exclude it from Defender scans, and hide its file attributes.",
  "sources": "Reads the executor_path parameter, configuration from AutostartConfig, and file system state (existence, copying files).",
  "sinks": "Creates a copy of the executable, runs PowerShell commands to modify Defender exclusions, sets file attributes to hidden.",
  "flows": "Copies the provided executable to an autostart directory -> Excludes the file from Defender scans -> Hides the file, enabling persistent and stealthy execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs actions that can be used to establish persistence, hide files, and disable security checks without user consent; no explicit validation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script manages persistence by copying an executable to a startup folder, attempts to evade Defender by adding exclusions, and hides the file attribute. These behaviors are typical of potentially malicious persistence mechanisms. No code injection, data leakage, or network activity is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but it implements common techniques to conceal and persist malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code facilitates persistence and stealth on Windows systems, which can be malicious if used without user consent. Its actions align with common tactics employed by malware to remain undetected and persist. The overall intent appears suspicious, likely malicious.",
