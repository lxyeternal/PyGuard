  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'speedtestpython' Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports 'setuptools' modules for setup and package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script performs static packaging configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the script is a standard setup configuration without suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard packaging modules and invokes setup with static package metadata. It uses find_packages() to discover packages in the project directory, which is common practice. No dynamic code execution, no input reading, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The script appears to be a straightforward, benign setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
