{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for packaging the Python project 'speedtestpython' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata (name, version) and uses find_packages() to include all packages in the project directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only sets up package configuration with static data and a package discovery method.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard setup configuration without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static parameters for package name and version, along with automatic package discovery. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious behavior observed. The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
