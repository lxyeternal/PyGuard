  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'speedtestpython' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup.py' file itself, which reads no external or untrusted input; it uses static data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or perform network, file, or system operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines package metadata with static values, typical for package distribution setup files. It does not execute any runtime code beyond the standard setup configuration, and it does not include any malicious or suspicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
