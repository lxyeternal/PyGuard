  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the original code, then evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Summary:** The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior.  \n   - **Assessment:** The code indeed is a typical `setup.py` using setuptools with no dynamic or malicious code.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — all appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup configuration.  \n   - **Assessment:** No issues detected; the code is static and benign.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Summary:** Standard setup script with no anomalies.  \n   - **Assessment:** Matches the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Summary:** Typical packaging setup with no malicious intent.  \n   - **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, static, and contains no suspicious elements.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Summary:** Standard setup script, no anomalies.  \n   - **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's content.  \n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identified the code as benign, with malware=0.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and straightforward; all reports assigned 0, which is accurate.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** The code performs no dynamic operations, no input/output, no network activity, and contains no secrets or vulnerabilities; a score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned across all reports are consistent and appropriate.  \n- No modifications are necessary.  \n- The code is a benign, standard `setup.py` script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project, with no security concerns. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
