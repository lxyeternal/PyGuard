  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'speedtestpython' Python package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; imports 'setuptools' for packaging functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output channels; no untrusted data handling or transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward setup configuration with no hidden or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines a package setup with a name, version, and package discovery. It performs a standard packaging operation without executing any additional code, network operations, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. The code is minimal and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines packaging parameters for 'speedtestpython'.",
