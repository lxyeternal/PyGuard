  "purpose": "This code defines the public API for a module by importing and exposing the AbstractSender class from a submodule.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own sender submodule.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing from a relative module and exposing it; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward and minimal, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class and defines the public interface. It does not execute any functions, handle input/output, or include any dynamic or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard module export pattern. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
