{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a module that exports an abstract sender class for use in a larger package.",
  "sources": "No direct input or data reading; only module import from sender and export declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only imports and defines exports without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious constructs identified. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named AbstractSender from a local module sender. It then defines __all__ to include only 'AbstractSender', indicating that it is a module intended to expose this class for external use. The code is simple, clean, and does not perform any operations beyond defining exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module export statement with no malicious or suspicious elements. It functions as a clean interface definition, with no indicators of malware or security issues.",
