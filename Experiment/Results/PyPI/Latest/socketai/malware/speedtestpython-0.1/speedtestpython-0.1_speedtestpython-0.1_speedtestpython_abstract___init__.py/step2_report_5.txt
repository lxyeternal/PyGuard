  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The original code is a minimal module that imports a class from a local module and exposes it via `__all__`. All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, with no data processing, external inputs, or dynamic behavior. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are reasonable given the code's simplicity. No changes are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. All reports correctly assign a score of 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are cautious and accurate in their evaluation.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores reflect the actual security posture.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is entirely benign. No security concerns are present, and the current scoring is appropriate.",
