{
  "purpose": "This code defines a minimal Python module that imports the AbstractSender class from a local sender module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module .sender to import AbstractSender.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement from .sender; there are no data flows beyond the import, and no untrusted data reaches any sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; it is a straightforward module export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import and export pattern, with no dynamic code execution, data processing, or external input handling. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports and scores are consistent and accurate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
