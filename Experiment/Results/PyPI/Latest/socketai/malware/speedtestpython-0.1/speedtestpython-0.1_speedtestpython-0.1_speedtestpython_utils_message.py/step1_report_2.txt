  "flows": "MessageConfig data -> MessageBoxW display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code constructs. The code simply displays a message box with configurable text.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Windows API via ctypes to display a message box with content sourced from MessageConfig. The MessageConfig class is external and not shown here, so its contents are unknown; however, assuming it contains message text and title, this is a benign use of the Windows API. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The try-except block suppresses exceptions, which might obscure errors but is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to perform a simple UI action without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script designed to show a fake error message window. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
