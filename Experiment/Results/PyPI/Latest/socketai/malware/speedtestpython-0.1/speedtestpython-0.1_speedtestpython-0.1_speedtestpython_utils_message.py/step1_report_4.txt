  "purpose": "Display a fake error message window using Windows API for possibly misleading or deceptive purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from speedtestpython.helpers.config for MessageConfig, which provides message text and title.",
  "sinks": "windll.user32.MessageBoxW is called to display a message box with content from MessageConfig.",
  "flows": "Message object initializes with MessageConfig; run() calls __create_message_window(), which uses windll to show a message box with configured message and title.",
  "anomalies": "Uses windll to create a Windows message box, which is uncommon in typical Python scripts unless intentionally for UI purposes. No user input is processed. Exception handling suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a fake error message window, which could be used deceptively but does not contain any malicious code or malware. The use of MessageConfig suggests customizable message content, but no malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and leverages Windows API to display a message box. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious side effects are present. It appears to be intended for benign or potentially deceptive UI display.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but could be used for deceptive purposes (e.g., fake error messages). There is no malware, no suspicious data leaks, and no security risks beyond possible misuse for deception. It is a benign utility script.",
