{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enums from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils, importing specific classes and enums.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network operations, file writes, or command executions in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: imported classes and enums are gathered and then exposed via __all__ for external use; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or hidden behaviors are evident. The code is clean and standard for module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules, presumably within the same package. It sets __all__ for explicit export, which is common practice for Python modules. No external data inputs, no network or file I/O, and no dynamic code execution are present. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or a module that aggregates exports. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module aggregator that imports and re-exports classes and enums. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign component of a larger package.",
