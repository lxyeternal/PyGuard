  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard module initializer or API aggregator, performing static imports and defining `__all__`.\n- No report mentions any dynamic behavior, network activity, data processing, or external input handling.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are zero or very low, consistent with the code's nature.\n- The code is straightforward, with no anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The actual code snippet is simple: static imports from local modules and an `__all__` declaration.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify this as benign package setup code with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious constructs.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or close to 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n- No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation, a risk score of 0.0–0.1 is justified.\n- Malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score of 0 is correct, as the code is clear.\n- Security risk is minimal, given the code's static, benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious intent based solely on static import patterns. While this is reasonable, it’s always good to consider that malicious code could be hidden elsewhere or in other parts of the package.\n- However, based on this snippet alone, the assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0–0.1 (negligible security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a benign, standard package initializer. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
