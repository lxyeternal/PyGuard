  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward package initializer, importing internal modules and defining `__all__`. \n   - No report indicates any anomalies, malicious activity, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code snippet is consistent across reports and aligns with standard Python package setup.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are uniformly accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), aligning with the absence of security concerns.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), fitting the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct. The code is purely for module setup without any malicious intent.\n   - If any score were higher, it would require evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerability, which is not present here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious operations such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not rely on unfounded assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static analysis.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate for the described code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 or very close to 0 (appropriate, no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard module initializer, importing internal components and exposing them via `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the comprehensive analysis above.",
