  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, designed to import specific classes and enums from local modules and define public API exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no use of untrusted data or external outputs within this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected; code is straightforward package initialization",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and enums from internal modules and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no runtime data manipulations, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are evident. The structure indicates standard package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a typical package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply exposes certain components for external use.",
