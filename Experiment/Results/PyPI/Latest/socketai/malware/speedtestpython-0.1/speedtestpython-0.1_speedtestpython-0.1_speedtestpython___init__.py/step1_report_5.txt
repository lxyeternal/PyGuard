{
  "purpose": "This code is for importing and exposing specific classes and enumerations for use in other modules or packages, likely related to some computational or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ms, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks of untrusted data are present in this snippet; no data processing or external output functions are visible",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident; the code only performs static imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected. The imports are from local modules, which appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and exposes them via __all__, a common pattern for API definition. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, code injection, or data leaks. The code structure is straightforward and typical for package initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign module initialization or API definition snippet with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
