{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal modules and exposing selected classes, enums, and utilities for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.ms, .enums, .utils)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that process external data or perform network operations",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flows from external sources to sinks; no runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing classes and enums from internal modules and defining __all__ for public API exposure. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The code structure is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no anomalies or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initializer with no malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
