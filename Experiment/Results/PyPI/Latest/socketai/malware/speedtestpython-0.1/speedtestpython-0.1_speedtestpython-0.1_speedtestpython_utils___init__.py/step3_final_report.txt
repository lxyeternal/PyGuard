  "purpose": "Module initializer that imports classes from local submodules and exposes them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from .autostart, .message, .loader, .protector, .grabber",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration; no data flow beyond module setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py module that imports classes from internal modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's structure and content do not suggest malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initializer with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and consistent with the code's content. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
