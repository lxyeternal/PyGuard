{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an __init__.py file to export specific classes from internal modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data handling or untrusted input processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; merely exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior; only import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and an explicit __all__ list to define public API. It does not execute any logic, handle data, or perform any operations that could be malicious. All modules are referenced via relative imports, which is standard for package internal structure. There are no signs of obfuscation, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package initializer defining the public interface. It presents no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
