{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports several classes from local files and exports them as a public interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imports and exports classes without data flow or external input processing",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected; straightforward module exports",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports five classes from relative modules and defines __all__ for export. No runtime data handling, user input processing, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior is present. The structure indicates a typical Python package interface file, with no anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
