  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a package by importing classes from local modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules and an __all__ declaration to specify exports. It does not include any data handling, user input, external network communication, or other potentially malicious operations. The module appears to serve as an interface aggregating several components.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code snippet. It functions as a straightforward module initializer or aggregator. The code is simple and does not contain any suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
