{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from local submodules and defines the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious code, no unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. There is no data input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a straightforward module setup. No malicious indicators or suspicious behavior are present. The structure suggests standard Python package organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module aggregator for local classes. No malicious or suspicious activity is identified based on the provided snippet.",
