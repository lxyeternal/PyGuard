  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, release, and deployment automation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, but presence of hardcoded credentials ('sikrit') in the `sanity_test_from_v1` function.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs legitimate automation tasks but highlights security risks due to plaintext passwords.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4. These seem reasonable, given no malicious code but insecure secrets.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, release, and testing automation.\n- **Findings:** Hardcoded credentials (`env.password`, `connect_kwargs.password`, `env.gateway`) with plaintext 'sikrit' and 'mypass'.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the security risk of secrets embedded in code. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.7. The high risk score is justified due to sensitive data exposure.\n\n**Note:** The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate. No adjustment needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Packaging and testing automation.\n- **Findings:** Hardcoded credentials ('sikrit', 'mypass') and environment modifications.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, security concerns about secrets but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3. Slightly lower risk, which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, release, testing, documentation.\n- **Findings:** Hardcoded passwords ('sikrit', 'mypass'), sys.path manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes insecure practices but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.6. Justified due to insecure secrets and environment handling.\n\n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, testing, release.\n- **Findings:** Hardcoded secrets, environment modifications.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes insecure practices, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n\n- **Code does not contain malware or obfuscated code.** All reports agree on this.\n- **Main issues are insecure handling of secrets** (hardcoded passwords and environment variables).\n- **Scores for malware are consistently 0,** which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores are high where secrets are hardcoded** (up to 0.7), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** Given the presence of plaintext secrets, I would assign a **risk score around 0.6** overall, reflecting significant security concern but no active malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.6**\n\nThe reports are consistent with this assessment. The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets, which should be addressed but does not constitute malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code should be refactored to externalize secrets and avoid hardcoded credentials to mitigate security risks.",
