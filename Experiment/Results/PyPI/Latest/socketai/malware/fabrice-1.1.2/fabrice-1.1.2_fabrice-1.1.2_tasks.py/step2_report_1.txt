  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for the issues raised, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, release, and deployment automation.\n- **Main concerns:** Hardcoded credentials are *not* present in the code snippet. The only mention is a comment referencing 'sikrit' password, but the code itself does not include plaintext passwords.\n- **Analysis:** No evidence of malicious code or secrets. The code is standard build automation with no obfuscation or malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.4 (possibly due to general security best practices, but not justified here).\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion that hardcoded secrets are present is inaccurate; the code does not contain such secrets. The risk score should be lowered to 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, release, testing, with explicit mention of hardcoded credentials like `'sikrit'`, `'mypass'`, and a gateway URL.\n- **Analysis:** Hardcoded secrets are indeed present, which is a security concern. No malicious code or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.7 (justified due to secrets).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code. The high risk score is appropriate given the hardcoded secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Packaging and testing workflows.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to above, hardcoded passwords `'sikrit'` and `'mypass'` are used, along with manipulation of `sys.path`.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.3 (lower, considering the code's benign intent but insecure practices).\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly identified insecure practices. The risk score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build, release, testing, with environment variable and secret handling.\n- **Analysis:** Hardcoded credentials `'sikrit'`, `'mypass'`, and other secrets are present. Manipulation of `sys.path` is noted.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.6 (justified).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Build/test automation with environment variables and secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Similar issues with hardcoded secrets and environment modifications.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.3.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious payloads or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Varying from 0.1 to 0.7, mainly due to hardcoded secrets and insecure practices.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- The core issue is the presence of hardcoded plaintext secrets (`'sikrit'`, `'mypass'`) and environment manipulation, which are security risks but do not constitute malware or obfuscation.\n- The code is standard build automation with insecure secret handling.\n\n**Recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.4 (moderate, due to secrets and environment manipulation)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n\n- The reports are consistent with the code.\n- The primary concern is insecure handling of secrets, not malicious intent.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical build/deployment script with insecure practices (hardcoded secrets). It does not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk score should be moderate, around 0.4, reflecting insecure secret management but no active malicious activity.",
