  "flows": "Source data (secrets/env vars) used in environment setup and system commands during build and deployment tasks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded plaintext secrets ('sikrit', 'mypass') and manipulation of sys.path and environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build and deployment automation with no obfuscated or malicious code. It contains hardcoded secrets and environment modifications, which are security risks but do not constitute malware. The malware score is 0, as no malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The obfuscated score is 0, with straightforward code. The risk score is moderate, around 0.6, reflecting insecure secret handling and environment manipulation but no active malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build/deployment script with insecure practices such as hardcoded plaintext secrets and environment modifications. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the insecure handling of secrets, which should be addressed, but the code does not exhibit malware or sabotage. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a moderate risk score of approximately 0.6.",
