  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build/deployment script with insecure practices such as hardcoded plaintext secrets and environment modifications. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the insecure handling of secrets, which should be addressed, but the code does not exhibit malware or sabotage. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a moderate risk score of approximately 0.6."
