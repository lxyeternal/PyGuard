  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing internal modules and exposing classes/functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file that imports internal modules for API exposure. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. The structure is typical and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriately zero, reflecting its harmless nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
