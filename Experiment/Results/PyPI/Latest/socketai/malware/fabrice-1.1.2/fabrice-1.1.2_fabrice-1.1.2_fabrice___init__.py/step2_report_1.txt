  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard `__init__.py` module, performing straightforward import and re-export of internal classes and functions.\n   - The code does not process external input, perform network operations, write files, or execute dynamic code. It simply exposes internal modules for external use.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Indicators:**\n   - No report mentions any suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution.\n   - The code structure is typical for Python packages, with no anomalies or signs of tampering.\n   - The import statements are from internal modules, which is standard and does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the analysis that the code is purely structural.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (1), reflecting the clear understanding of the code's purpose.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - Since the code is purely import statements with no dynamic or external data handling, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The analysis correctly dismisses any suspicion of supply chain attack or malware.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of any suspicious activity, should be **0**.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- Even if future code adds dynamic behavior, this snippet alone is benign.\n- The consistent high confidence and zero suspicion across all reports are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module initialization file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
