{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a larger Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception classes are static definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code is only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code consists solely of class definitions and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, each serving a specific purpose within a larger codebase. There are no dynamic operations, no data processing, and no interaction with external inputs. The comments suggest potential future refactoring or code movement, but no executable logic that could be malicious. The classes are straightforward, with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application, serving as structured exception handling.",
