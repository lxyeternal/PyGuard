  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a set of simple class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No dynamic logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - The classes serve as structured error handling within a larger application.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in stating that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly identify that these are just exception class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, and the code is simple class definitions, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, obfuscation, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not contain malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the true nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and standard.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed explanation or further analysis.",
