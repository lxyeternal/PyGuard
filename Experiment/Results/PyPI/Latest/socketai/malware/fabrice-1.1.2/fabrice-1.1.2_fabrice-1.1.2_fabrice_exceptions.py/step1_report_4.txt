  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to task grouping and environment validation in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their constructors, primarily the exception classes and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are used for error signaling only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious behavior. The classes are standard and used for error handling. No security issues, malicious activities, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
