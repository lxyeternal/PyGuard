  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exception classes for use in a larger Python application, possibly related to task grouping and environment validation.\n- **Findings:** No external input, data processing, or malicious activity. The code is static class definitions with comments indicating potential future refactoring.\n- **Security assessment:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining custom exceptions for task grouping and environment validation.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic behavior, no external data handling, straightforward class definitions.\n- **Security assessment:** No malicious activity or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines exception classes for error handling.\n- **Findings:** Static class definitions, no dynamic code, no external input.\n- **Security assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Exception classes for task grouping and environment validation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no external data.\n- **Security assessment:** No malware or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, defining exception classes.\n- **Findings:** Static class definitions, no external interactions.\n- **Security assessment:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports analyze identical or very similar code: simple, static exception class definitions.\n- **Malware Risk:** None detected in any report. The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security Risk:** None evident; the code is purely structural.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is standard, benign exception class definitions with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall risk.",
