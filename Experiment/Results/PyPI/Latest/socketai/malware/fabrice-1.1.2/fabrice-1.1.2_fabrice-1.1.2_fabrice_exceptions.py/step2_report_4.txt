  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the findings:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only contains class definitions for exceptions with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not introduce any security concerns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that these are benign exception class definitions.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty in their assessments.\n   - The scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - If any score were higher, it would require evidence of malicious intent or security issues, which are absent here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that the code is standard exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the assessments provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely defining custom exception classes with no dynamic or external interactions. It is standard, straightforward, and free from malicious or obfuscated elements. The existing assessments are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores are appropriate, and there is no indication of security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The code is a safe, typical part of a larger Python application.",
