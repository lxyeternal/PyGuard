  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated structures identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions with docstrings and a comment. There are no external inputs, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The classes are simple, inheriting from Exception, used for error handling. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class definitions for exception handling, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is standard and safe.",
