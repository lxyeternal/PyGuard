{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external input, data reading, or dynamic data sources; static class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with comments indicating potential future refactoring but no current suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with no dynamic or executable logic. It does not interact with external data, perform code execution, or contain obfuscation. The comments suggest possible future refactoring but do not introduce security concerns. The code is standard for error handling and poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
