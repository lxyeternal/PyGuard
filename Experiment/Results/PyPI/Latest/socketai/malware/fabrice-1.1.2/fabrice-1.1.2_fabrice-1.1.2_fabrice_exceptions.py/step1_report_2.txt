{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a Python project, likely related to task grouping, environment validation, and error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines classes and exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data handling; only class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. Each inherits from Exception and has straightforward constructors or docstrings. There are no dynamic imports, code execution, or data handling. The code appears to be part of a larger application where these exceptions are used for control flow or error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security concerns. It serves as a structural component within a larger codebase.",
