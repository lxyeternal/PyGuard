  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no dynamic operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears benign and typical for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious activity, there is no justification for a higher risk score. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the fact that there is no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that the code is benign and standard.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall Justification**:  \nThe code is a set of standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe code is safe, benign, and serves as a structural component for error handling. No further action or concern is necessary.",
