  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, configuring package names, version, dependencies, and entry points based on environment and directory checks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, directory existence checks, reading version info from '_version.py', reading README file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of '_version.py' via exec(), which could execute arbitrary code if the file is malicious.",
  "flows": "Environment and directory checks influence package and binary naming; reading '_version.py' and executing its content sets the version; dependencies and entry points are configured for setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute '_version.py' content, which is a known pattern but can be risky if the file is compromised; no other suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with minimal security concerns. The primary issue is the use of exec() on a local version file, which could be exploited if the file is malicious or tampered with. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the context. The code's logic is straightforward, and no malicious intent is evident. To improve security, replacing exec() with safer version parsing or importing the version module directly is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a minor security concern related to exec(). No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score is justified but could be lowered if safer version loading methods are used. Overall, the code is benign with a known pattern that warrants cautious handling of '_version.py'.",
