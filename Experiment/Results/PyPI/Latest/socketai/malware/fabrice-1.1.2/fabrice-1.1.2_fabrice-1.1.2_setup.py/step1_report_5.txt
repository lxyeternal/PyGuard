  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package for distribution, including dependency management, version reading, and entry point definition.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, reads README and version files, dynamically executes version file content, and gathers package files.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing contents of _version.py; reading files (README.rst, _version.py); environment variable (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2).",
  "flows": "Environment variable determines package configuration -> reading files for description and version -> executing _version.py to obtain version -> setup() function finalizes package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute _version.py content can be risky if the file is compromised or malicious, as it executes code without validation. No other suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package: determining package names based on environment variables and directory presence, reading version info from a file, reading README for long description, and configuring setup parameters. The only potentially suspicious element is the use of exec() to execute _version.py, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with, but in typical open-source packages, this is common for dynamic version reading. No malicious behaviors such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script with a minor security concern regarding the use of exec() for executing version code, which could be exploited if _version.py is maliciously altered. No signs of malware or malicious intent otherwise.",
