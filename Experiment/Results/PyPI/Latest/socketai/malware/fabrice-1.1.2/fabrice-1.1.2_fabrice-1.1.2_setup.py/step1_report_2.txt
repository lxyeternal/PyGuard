{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup for a Python package named 'fabrice', including determining the package version, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), file reads (README.rst, _version.py), directory checks for 'fabric' and 'fabric2'.",
  "sinks": "Reading files (README.rst, _version.py), executing code from _version.py via exec(), setting entry points for console scripts.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences package naming -> Directory checks influence package selection -> Reading version info from _version.py via exec() -> Reading README -> Setup configuration -> Defining console script entry point.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute code from _version.py without validation or sandboxing, which can be risky if the _version.py content is malicious or tampered with. No other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, including reading version info and configuration details. The use of exec() on _version.py, if manipulated, could execute malicious code; however, in normal circumstances, this is a common practice for dynamic version loading. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious behavior is detected. The code structure appears conventional and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily standard setup script with a potentially risky use of exec() on a version file, which could be exploited if the _version.py file is compromised. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware, but the exec() pattern warrants caution.",
