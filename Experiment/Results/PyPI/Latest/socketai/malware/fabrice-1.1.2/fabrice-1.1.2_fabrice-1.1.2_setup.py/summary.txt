  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a minor security concern related to exec(). No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score is justified but could be lowered if safer version loading methods are used. Overall, the code is benign with a known pattern that warrants cautious handling of '_version.py'."
