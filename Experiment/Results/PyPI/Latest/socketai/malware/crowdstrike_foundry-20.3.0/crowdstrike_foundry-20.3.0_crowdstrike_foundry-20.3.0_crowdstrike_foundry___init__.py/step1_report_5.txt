  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious behavior is present. No data transmission or network activity shown.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a telemetry class and creates an instance, likely for usage elsewhere in the package. No malicious or suspicious actions are evident in this snippet. The only concern would be the telemetry's behavior, but that is outside the scope of this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard telemetry initialization, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
