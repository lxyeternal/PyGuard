  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry tracking when the package is imported",
  "sources": "Import statement for Telemetry class, instantiation of telemetry object",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; telemetry object could potentially collect or transmit data",
  "flows": "Import -> instantiate Telemetry -> assign to telemetry variable",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behavior observed in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class called Telemetry and creates an instance of it during module import. The purpose appears to be to enable telemetry tracking, which could involve data collection. The code itself is straightforward and lacks any obfuscated or malicious constructs. However, the actual behavior depends on the implementation of the Telemetry class, which is not provided here. Without additional context or the Telemetry class code, it is not possible to determine if data collection is malicious or privacy-invasive.",
  "conclusion": "The code sets up telemetry tracking by instantiating a Telemetry object upon import. There is no direct evidence of malicious intent in this snippet alone. The primary concern is that the Telemetry class might collect and transmit user data, but this cannot be confirmed without inspecting that class's implementation. Overall, the code is simple and does not exhibit malicious behavior by itself.",
