  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry functionality upon module import, potentially for data collection or analytics.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Telemetry class; instantiation of Telemetry object at module load.",
  "sinks": "Potential data transmission or logging within the Telemetry class, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import of Telemetry -> Instantiation of Telemetry object -> Possible internal data handling or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and instantiation. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class and creates an instance immediately, which could trigger data collection or transmission. The actual behavior depends on the implementation of the Telemetry class, which is not provided. The code is clear and standard for telemetry setup. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the limited information. The primary concern is whether the Telemetry class performs data exfiltration, but this cannot be assessed here. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary unless further details are revealed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for initializing telemetry. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk is low, primarily due to potential data collection, but this cannot be confirmed without the Telemetry class implementation. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained unless additional information indicates malicious behavior.",
