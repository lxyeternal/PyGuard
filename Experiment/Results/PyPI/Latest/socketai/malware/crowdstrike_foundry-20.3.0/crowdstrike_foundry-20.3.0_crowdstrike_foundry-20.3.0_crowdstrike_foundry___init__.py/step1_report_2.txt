  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry tracking when the package is imported",
  "sources": "Import statement for telemetry module, instantiation of Telemetry object",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output operations present",
  "flows": "Import leads to instantiation of Telemetry object; no data flow observable from the code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard initialization pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports a telemetry module, creates an instance of Telemetry, and sets a version string. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior. The telemetry object might collect usage data, but this is typical in many packages and not inherently malicious. No sensitive data, credentials, or external connections are evident here.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard telemetry initialization without malicious intent. There are no suspicious behaviors or security risks detected within this small snippet.",
