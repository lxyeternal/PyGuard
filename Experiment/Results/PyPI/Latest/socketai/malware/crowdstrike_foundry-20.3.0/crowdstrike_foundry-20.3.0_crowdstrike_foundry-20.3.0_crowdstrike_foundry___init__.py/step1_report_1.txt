  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry for data collection or usage tracking when the package is imported.",
  "sources": "Import statement from telemetry module, creation of Telemetry instance",
  "sinks": "Potentially sends data over network if Telemetry class includes such behavior (not visible here)",
  "flows": "Import from .telemetry -> instantiate Telemetry -> possibly send data during or after initialization",
  "anomalies": "No explicit anomalies in this small snippet; the code itself is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Telemetry class from a local module, then creates an instance immediately upon import, which may trigger telemetry data collection or transmission if the class is designed to do so. The version string indicates the package version but is not inherently suspicious. Without the implementation of the Telemetry class, we cannot confirm if it sends data externally or performs malicious actions. The code is minimal and standard for initializing telemetry or analytics, common in many packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple telemetry initialization with no evident malicious behavior in this fragment. The potential security concern depends on the Telemetry class implementation, which is not provided here. Based solely on this code, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent.",
