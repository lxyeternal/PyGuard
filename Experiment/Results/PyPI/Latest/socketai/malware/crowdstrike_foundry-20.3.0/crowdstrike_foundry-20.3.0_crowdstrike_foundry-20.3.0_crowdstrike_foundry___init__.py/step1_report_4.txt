  "purpose": "Initialize telemetry object upon package import for tracking or analytics",
  "sources": "Import statement from .telemetry module, instantiation of Telemetry() object",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import -> instantiate Telemetry object -> potential telemetry data collection",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no obvious anomalies; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Telemetry from a local module, then creates an instance immediately upon import, and sets a version string. There are no visible data leaks, external network calls, or malicious behaviors. Without the implementation details of the Telemetry class, it's impossible to determine if it performs malicious actions, but based on this snippet alone, it appears to be for telemetry collection. No obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely used for telemetry or usage tracking. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet. The main concern depends on the behavior of the Telemetry class, which is not visible here.",
