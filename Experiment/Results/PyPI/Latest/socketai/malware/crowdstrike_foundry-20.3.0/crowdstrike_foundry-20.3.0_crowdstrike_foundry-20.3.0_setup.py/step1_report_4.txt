{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for 'crowdstrike-foundry' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, package discovery, reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to untrusted outputs or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters (e.g., install_requires, long_description) are set from static values or local files, with no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.md').read() without exception handling or validation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and file reading for the long description. The open() call to read 'README.md' is common practice but could be improved with exception handling to avoid runtime errors if the file is missing. No suspicious code, no external data ingestion beyond dependencies and local files, and no malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices and does not contain malicious or suspicious code segments.",
