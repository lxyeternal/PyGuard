{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'crowdstrike-foundry' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads package information, version, dependencies, author details, description, and README content from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows lead to security-sensitive sinks such as network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content for long description; uses this data in package setup without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Reads 'README.md' directly without sanitization, but this is standard practice. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It reads the long description from an external file, which is typical. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or untrusted input handling that could indicate malicious activity. The code is straightforward setup configuration with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
