  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and read the README.md file for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file directly via open() without exception handling",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external network calls; static configuration data",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static package metadata assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without a context manager, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and reads the README.md file directly. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or handling of untrusted user input. The only minor concern is the use of open() without a context manager, which is a style issue but not a security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward and standard nature of the code. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minor style issue with file handling does not impact security. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The overall security risk is negligible, and the package can be considered safe for use.",
