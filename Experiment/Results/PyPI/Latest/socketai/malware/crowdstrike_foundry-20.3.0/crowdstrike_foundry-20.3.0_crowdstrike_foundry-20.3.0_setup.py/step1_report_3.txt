{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'crowdstrike-foundry' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The content of 'README.md' could potentially include untrusted data if the file is tampered with, but this is standard practice and unlikely malicious.",
  "flows": "The file content is read and passed as an argument to 'long_description'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows typical setup.py patterns. The use of 'open' without a context manager is a minor style issue but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines the setup configuration, including package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads 'README.md' to include as a long description. There are no dynamic code executions, no network calls, and no handling of untrusted user input. The code performs a straightforward package setup process without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies, with no embedded malicious logic.",
