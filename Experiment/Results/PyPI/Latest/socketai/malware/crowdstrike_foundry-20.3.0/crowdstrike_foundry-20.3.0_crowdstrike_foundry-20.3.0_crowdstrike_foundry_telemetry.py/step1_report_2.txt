  "purpose": "Collect and send system telemetry data to a specified webhook URL for monitoring or tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, fqdn, IP address, OS details, Python version, installation path, current working directory, and current timestamp.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via HTTP POST request to the webhook URL, which transmits collected system info over the network.",
  "flows": "System information is gathered in get_system_info() and then transmitted in send_telemetry() via an HTTP POST request to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically sends detailed system information upon instantiation without user consent. The webhook URL is hardcoded, and no validation or opt-out mechanism is present. No data encryption or user notification is implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class Telemetry that collects various system details and sends them to a specified webhook URL immediately upon instantiation. It uses standard Python modules for system info collection and requests for network transmission. The data includes hostname, IP address, OS details, Python version, and current directories, along with a timestamp. The information is transmitted via an HTTP POST request with JSON payload. There are no obvious malicious behaviors such as code injection, data theft beyond system info, or reverse shell activities. The main concern is the silent data exfiltration of detailed system info without user consent or notification, which could be considered privacy-invasive or suspicious depending on context. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and sends it to an external webhook automatically, which can be considered privacy-invasive and potentially malicious in contexts where user consent is lacking. However, it does not contain malicious payloads or malware behaviors like data theft, system damage, or reverse shells. Its primary concern is the covert transmission of system data, which warrants caution but does not constitute malware.",
