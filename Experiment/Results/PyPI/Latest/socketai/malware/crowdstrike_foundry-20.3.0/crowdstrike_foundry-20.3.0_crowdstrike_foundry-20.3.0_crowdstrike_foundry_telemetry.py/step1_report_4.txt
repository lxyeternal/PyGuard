  "sinks": "requests.post() to the webhook URL with system info as JSON payload",
  "flows": "System info is gathered via get_system_info() and sent directly to the webhook in send_telemetry()",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL; no validation or obfuscation of data; no user consent or encryption indicated",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information such as IP address, hostname, OS details, Python version, and current working directory. It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a specified webhook URL. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration beyond monitoring or backdoor access. The hardcoded URL and data collection could be used for tracking without user consent but do not directly constitute malware. No suspicious obfuscation, malicious code, or dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for telemetry collection, possibly for legitimate monitoring or for malicious tracking. It does not exhibit malware or malicious intent based on the current analysis but could be used for privacy-invasive purposes. The code itself is straightforward without obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
