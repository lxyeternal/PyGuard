  "flows": "System info obtained via get_system_info() -> data prepared -> sent via requests.post() to webhook_url",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL which could be used for exfiltration; no user input is read, so no input flow anomalies; no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that gathers detailed system information, including IP address, hostname, OS details, and current working directory. It then sends this data to a hardcoded webhook URL using an HTTP POST request. The data collection is straightforward and involves no user input or data manipulation beyond system info collection. The webhook URL is a fixed, external endpoint, which could potentially be used for exfiltrating system details without user consent. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious backdoors, or other malicious behaviors. The code seems to serve the purpose of telemetry or system monitoring, but the use of a suspiciously named or external webhook could be a privacy or security concern depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for system information collection and exfiltration via a webhook. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code. However, the hardcoded webhook URL and the silent failure on exceptions could be considered suspicious if used without user awareness. Overall, it appears to be a telemetry tool with potential privacy implications but no clear malicious intent.",
