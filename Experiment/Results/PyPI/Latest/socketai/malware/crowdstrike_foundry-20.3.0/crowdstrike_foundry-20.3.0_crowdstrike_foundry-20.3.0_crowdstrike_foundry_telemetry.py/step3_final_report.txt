{
  "purpose": "Collects system information (IP, hostname, OS details, etc.) and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded webhook URL, likely for telemetry or tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostbyname, socket.gethostname, socket.getfqdn, platform.system, platform.version, platform.release, platform.python_version, os.path.abspath, os.getcwd, datetime.utcnow",
  "sinks": "requests.post to a fixed external URL with JSON data",
  "flows": "get_system_info() gathers data -> send_telemetry() posts data to webhook URL",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling that suppresses errors; hardcoded webhook URL; automatic data exfiltration upon class instantiation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward telemetry script that collects system info and sends it to a fixed external URL without user consent or encryption. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The primary concern is privacy invasion through silent data exfiltration. The exception handling suppresses errors, which could hide failures but does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0 or 0.1, security risk: 0.3-0.6, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the behavior. Given the absence of malicious payloads, the malware score should be 0. The privacy invasion and silent exfiltration justify a moderate security risk (~0.5-0.6). Overall, the code is not malware but has privacy implications that warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs passive system info collection and exfiltration without malicious payloads or obfuscation. It is primarily privacy-invasive telemetry. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score around 0.5-0.6 due to privacy concerns. It should be reviewed for user consent if deployed in production.",
