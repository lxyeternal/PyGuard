  "conclusion": "The code performs passive system info collection and exfiltration without malicious payloads or obfuscation. It is primarily privacy-invasive telemetry. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score around 0.5-0.6 due to privacy concerns. It should be reviewed for user consent if deployed in production."
