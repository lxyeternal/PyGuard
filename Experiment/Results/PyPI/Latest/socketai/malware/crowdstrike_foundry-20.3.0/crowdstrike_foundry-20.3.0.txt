All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The overall security risk is negligible, and the package can be considered safe for use."

The current scores are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score around 0.5-0.6 due to privacy concerns. It should be reviewed for user consent if deployed in production."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for initializing telemetry. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The risk is low, primarily due to potential data collection, but this cannot be confirmed without the Telemetry class implementation. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained unless additional information indicates malicious behavior."
