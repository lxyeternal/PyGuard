  "sources": "The source is the import statement from the local module './main'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple import statement with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual patterns. The import statement is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors. The import is standard Python syntax. No embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. Due to the simplicity, there's no indication of malicious intent or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, representing a simple module import. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain compromise, or security risks.",
