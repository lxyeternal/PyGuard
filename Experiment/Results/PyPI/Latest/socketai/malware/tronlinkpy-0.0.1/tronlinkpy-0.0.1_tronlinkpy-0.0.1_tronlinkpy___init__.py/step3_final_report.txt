{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of 'perm' from a local module 'main', likely to use the imported function or variable elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module 'main'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "The source (import) provides 'perm' to the rest of the code; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import, which is standard in Python projects. It does not execute code beyond importing a symbol. Without inspecting 'main.py', no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The import itself is benign, with no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores should remain at 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and poses no security threat by itself. Any malicious behavior would depend on the contents of 'main.py', which cannot be assessed here. The scores are consistent with this analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
