  "purpose": "Importing the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing paths are present beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple relative import from a local module, which is standard in Python packages. There is no evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues within this snippet. The import could be part of a larger application, but on its own, it does not exhibit any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and performs a standard import operation. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
