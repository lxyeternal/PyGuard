  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a module named 'main' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'perm' from a local module called 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this single import statement; it is merely importing code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists in this isolated code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with only an import statement. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a component called 'perm' from a local module 'main'. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic that could be malicious. The presence of an import alone does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or security issues are evident from this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a Python module.",
