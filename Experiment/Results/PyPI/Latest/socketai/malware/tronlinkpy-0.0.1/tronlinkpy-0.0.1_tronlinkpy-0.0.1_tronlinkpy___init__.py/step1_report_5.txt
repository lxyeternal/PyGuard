  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module file 'main' when importing.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the import itself is a static operation without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A, the import statement does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement; there are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a specific component 'perm' from a local module named 'main'. It is a standard Python import statement with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code present. The minimal nature of this code suggests it functions as part of a larger codebase, and on its own, it poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not introduce any security risks by itself.",
