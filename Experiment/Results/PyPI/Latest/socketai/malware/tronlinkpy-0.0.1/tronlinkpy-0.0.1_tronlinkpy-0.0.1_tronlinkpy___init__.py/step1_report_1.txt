{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module from the local package, potentially executing code in 'main.py'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the code only performs an import, which does not by itself lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source (import) may execute code within 'main.py', which could contain malicious behavior, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a single import statement; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident from this isolated line.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports 'perm' from a local module 'main'. The import may execute code within 'main.py', but without inspecting 'main.py', no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The minimal code does not include any suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. As it stands, it's a straightforward import statement.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code. However, potential malicious behavior could reside within 'main.py', which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
