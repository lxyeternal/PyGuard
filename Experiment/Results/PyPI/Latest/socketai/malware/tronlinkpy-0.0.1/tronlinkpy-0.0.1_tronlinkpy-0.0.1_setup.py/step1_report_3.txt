  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'tronlinkpy' to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; no network or system command executions observed.",
  "flows": "Read from README.md file -> package setup metadata -> package installation dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The URL in 'project_urls' is a generic placeholder, not malicious but indicates a non-verified source.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file for long description, defines package metadata, dependencies, author info, and repository URL. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The URL is a placeholder and does not point to a malicious site. The script does not perform any network operations, code execution, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign package configuration file.",
