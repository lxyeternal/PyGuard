{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'tronlinkpy' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, and static metadata definitions (name, version, author, etc.).",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted input sources; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; only static assignments and file reading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a basic setup script with no validation, but no suspicious or malicious code detected. The URL 'https://github.com' is generic and placeholder-like but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools, reads a README file for package description, and defines package metadata. No code execution, network connections, or handling of untrusted data is present. The only noteworthy aspect is the generic GitHub URL, which is a placeholder. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies.",
