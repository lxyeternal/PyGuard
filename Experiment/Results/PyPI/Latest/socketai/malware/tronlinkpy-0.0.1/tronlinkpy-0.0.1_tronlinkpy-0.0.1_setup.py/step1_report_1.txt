{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'tronlinkpy', used for packaging and distribution of the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, user inputs via package metadata (author, email). No untrusted data sources present.",
  "targets": "No specific sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity; the setup process involves standard package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process external input dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The source URL is a placeholder and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, reads a README file for description, and defines package metadata. It uses a benign approach typical for Python packaging. No suspicious code, no external data inputs, no network activity or code execution is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
