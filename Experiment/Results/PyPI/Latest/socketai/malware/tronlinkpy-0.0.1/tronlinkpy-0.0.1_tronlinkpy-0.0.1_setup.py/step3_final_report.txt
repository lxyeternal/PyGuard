  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'tronlinkpy' Python library, reading README.md for long description, and specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; static package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder URL ('https://github.com') is incomplete but not malicious; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python packaging script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated segments. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero. The only minor concern is the placeholder URL, which does not pose a security threat but indicates incomplete configuration. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The placeholder URL is not malicious but suggests incomplete info. All reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
