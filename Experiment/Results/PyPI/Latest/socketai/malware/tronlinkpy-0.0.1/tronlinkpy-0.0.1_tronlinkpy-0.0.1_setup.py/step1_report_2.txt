  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'tronlinkpy' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools, defining package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no external code execution or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md content during package setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; no dynamic execution or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads a README file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All code appears to be straightforward and typical for Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious injections are present. The only external input is the README.md file, which is a common practice and unlikely to be malicious. No suspicious or anomalous code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and standard for Python package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code.",
