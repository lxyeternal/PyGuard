  "conclusion": "The code is designed (or flawed) to exfiltrate private keys to an external server, representing a serious security threat. The high malware and risk scores are justified by this behavior. The typo and improper data structure suggest possible obfuscation or negligence, but do not diminish the malicious intent. Overall, the code should be considered malicious with a high security risk."
