  "flows": "Data collected from environment, package metadata, and call stack flows into JSON payload, which is sent over HTTPS to external server",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code; data transmission occurs unprompted without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code gathers environment details, package info, and call stack, then sends this data to an external URL via HTTPS. It uses standard libraries and straightforward logic. No malicious actions such as code injection, data theft, or destructive operations are present. The external URL is a testing endpoint, indicating benign intent. Privacy concerns are notable but do not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for diagnostics or monitoring, with no evidence of malicious activity. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. The primary concern is privacy, due to unprompted data transmission. Malware score should be 0; obfuscation score 0; security risk around 0.2-0.3 reflecting privacy implications.",
