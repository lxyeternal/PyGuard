  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple, benign, with no external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- The code consists of two functions: one prints a static message, the other adds two parameters.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are claimed or observed.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Confirmations and issues:**\n- The code matches the description: no anomalies, no suspicious behavior, straightforward functions.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- The purpose and flow descriptions are accurate.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or points to challenge:**\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The \"malware\" score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent.\n- The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable given the straightforwardness.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n- The scores reflect the actual risk level appropriately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scoring aligns well with the analysis. No adjustments needed.",
