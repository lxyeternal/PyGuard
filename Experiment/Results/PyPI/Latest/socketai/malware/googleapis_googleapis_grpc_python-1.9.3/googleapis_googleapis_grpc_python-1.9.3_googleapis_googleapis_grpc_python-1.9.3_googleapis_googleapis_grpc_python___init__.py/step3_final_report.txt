{
  "purpose": "The code provides simple logging and addition functions, intended for basic utility within a package.",
  "sources": "The functions do not read external input, environment variables, or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to function parameters and a static print statement; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions: one prints a static message, the other adds two numbers. No external data sources, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The functions are simple, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent, correctly identifying the straightforward and safe nature of the functions. No adjustments to scores or analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
