  "purpose": "Provides simple logging and mathematical addition functions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for simple_math_operation.",
  "sinks": "Return value of simple_math_operation; output to stdout via print in log_message.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into the addition operation; result used internally and no external sink involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one prints a static message, the other adds two inputs. There are no external data sources, no network operations, or hidden behaviors. Usage appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs basic logging and addition functions without any suspicious patterns.",
