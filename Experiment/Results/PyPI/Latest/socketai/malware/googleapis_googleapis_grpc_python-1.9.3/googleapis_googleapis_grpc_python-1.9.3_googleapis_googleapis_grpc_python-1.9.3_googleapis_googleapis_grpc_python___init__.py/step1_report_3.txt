  "purpose": "Provides simple logging message and performs basic addition operation",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' in simple_math_operation",
  "sinks": "Return statement in simple_math_operation; print statement in log_message",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into addition operation; output flows to return; print outputs message to console",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions: one prints a static greeting message, and the other performs addition of two inputs. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. No external data sources or untrusted input handling beyond normal parameter passing, and no unsafe operations identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple logging and addition with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
