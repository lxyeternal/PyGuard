{
  "purpose": "The code defines simple functions for logging and basic addition, likely intended for illustrative or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; all data is hardcoded or passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, system effects, or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; functions operate independently with no external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward function definitions: one for printing a message and one for performing addition. Both functions operate on parameters or constants with no external input, environment variables, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and serves basic utility or illustrative purposes without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
