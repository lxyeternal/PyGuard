{
  "purpose": "The code provides basic logging message output and a simple mathematical addition function.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' in the function simple_math_operation.",
  "sinks": "The print statement in log_message which outputs a static message; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters 'a' and 'b' into the addition operation in simple_math_operation, but the output is not used beyond return; no external data flows out.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two straightforward functions: one prints a static greeting message; the other performs an addition operation. There are no external data inputs (beyond function parameters) that could be exploited, no use of environment variables, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The print statement outputs a fixed message with no user input influence. The addition function simply returns the sum of its parameters without side effects or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic operations and outputs a static message, posing no threat.",
