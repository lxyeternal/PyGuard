  "purpose": "Provides simple logging and basic addition operation",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' for the addition function",
  "sinks": "Return statement in 'simple_math_operation'",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow into the addition operation, result returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior, only straightforward functions",
  "analysis": "The code contains two simple functions: one prints a greeting message, and the other performs an addition of two inputs. No external data sources, network communication, or environment variable usage are present. The code does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be benign and intended for basic logging and mathematical operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs straightforward functions, and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
