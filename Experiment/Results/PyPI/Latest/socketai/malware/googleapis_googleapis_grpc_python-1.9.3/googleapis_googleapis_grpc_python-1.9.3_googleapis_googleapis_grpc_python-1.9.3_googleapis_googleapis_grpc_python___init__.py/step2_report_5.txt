  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple, benign, and without malicious intent.\n- The code only contains two functions: one for printing a static message, and one for adding two parameters.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or environment variable usage is mentioned.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are observed.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which seems consistent with the described code.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward and matches the descriptions. No issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors or flaws in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores assigned:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign description.\n   - The `confidence` scores are all 1, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is clearly benign, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - No malicious activity is indicated or implied.\n   - Malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they state the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - No problematic claims are present.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is very simple, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- All scores are appropriate.\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed.",
