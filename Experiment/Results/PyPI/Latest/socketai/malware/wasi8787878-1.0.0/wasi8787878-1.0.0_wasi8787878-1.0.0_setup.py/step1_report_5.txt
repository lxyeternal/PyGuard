  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to an external URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with parameters including hostname, cwd, username",
  "flows": "System info gathered from sources and sent via HTTP GET request to external URL in the run() method",
  "anomalies": "The code unconditionally sends system information to an external server without user consent or obvious necessity. It overrides the install command, which is unusual for legitimate packages.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, collects hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain with this information. The URL appears to be a malicious or testing domain used to exfiltrate data, which is highly unusual and indicative of malicious intent. The code executes this action every time the package is installed, with no opt-out or warning, which is suspicious. There are no other benign or necessary functionalities; this pattern is consistent with malicious activity aimed at data exfiltration during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system data to an external server during package installation. This is a clear security concern, indicating malicious intent or a backdoor. It is highly likely to be malicious due to the suspicious URL and data collection behavior.",
