{
  "purpose": "The code exfiltrates system information during package installation by sending hostname, current directory, and username to a remote server via an HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from system calls: socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends data to an external URL, transmitting collected system info over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source functions (hostname, cwd, username) to the requests.get() call, which transmits the data to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The data exfiltration occurs during setup.py execution without user consent, using a suspicious, obfuscated URL; the exfiltration is embedded directly into the installation process, which is unusual and malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, gathers system info and sends it via an HTTP request to a suspicious URL. This behavior is not typical for benign setup scripts and indicates malicious intent, such as covert data collection. The URL appears obfuscated or dynamically generated, further suggesting malicious activity. The exfiltration occurs during every package installation, making it a persistent privacy violation. No other malicious behaviors are present. The activity is clearly malicious, involving unauthorized data transmission, which justifies high malware and security risk scores. The suspicious URL and covert nature support an obfuscation score of approximately 0.8. Overall, the code demonstrates malicious behavior with high confidence, and the activity poses a significant security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, representing malicious activity. It justifies a malware score of 0.9, a security risk score of 0.9, and an obfuscation score of 0.8. The activity compromises user privacy and system security, warranting high alert and removal from repositories.",
