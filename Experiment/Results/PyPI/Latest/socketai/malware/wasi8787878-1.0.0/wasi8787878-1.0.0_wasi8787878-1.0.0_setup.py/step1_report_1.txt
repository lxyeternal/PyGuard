  "purpose": "Custom installation process that sends system information to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - system data; requests.get() call sending data to external URL",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with parameters containing system data, which is sent to an external server",
  "flows": "Gather hostname, current working directory, and username -> send via HTTP GET request to external domain",
  "anomalies": "Code performs data exfiltration during installation without user consent; no validation or obfuscation; hardcoded URL for data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, collects hostname, current directory, and username, then makes an HTTP GET request to a remote URL with these parameters. This behavior is indicative of potential malicious activity, such as system data exfiltration. The URL used is suspicious and resembles a command-and-control or tracking server. The rest of the setup code appears standard, but the side-effect during installation is highly suspicious and designed to covertly transmit data.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes malicious behavior, exfiltrating system information during installation without user consent. This constitutes malicious code designed to spy on the system or gather information surreptitiously.",
