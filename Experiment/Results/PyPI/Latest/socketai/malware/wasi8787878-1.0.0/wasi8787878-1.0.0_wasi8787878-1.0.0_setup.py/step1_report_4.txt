  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to include sending system information to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname via socket.gethostname(), current working directory via os.getcwd(), and username via getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "Performs an HTTP GET request to a remote URL with collected system information as parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects system info (source) and sends it over the network through requests.get (sink), potentially exposing system details during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends sensitive system info to an external server without user consent, which is suspicious. The URL appears obfuscated and potentially malicious. The code executes during installation, which is unusual for benign setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom install command that, after running the normal installation, gathers hostname, current directory, and username. It then sends this data to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking. The URL is obfuscated, which is common in malicious code to avoid detection. Such activity during package installation can be used for malicious tracking, system fingerprinting, or data theft. The code does not perform any other benign function beyond typical setup tasks. This pattern strongly indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious activity.\n\nThe package itself appears innocuous, but the embedded behavior during install is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it secretly transmits system information to an external server during installation. This activity is suspicious and could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration, violating user trust and security best practices.",
