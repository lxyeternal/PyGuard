{
  "purpose": "The script customizes the installation process of a Python package, and during installation, it collects system information and exfiltrates it to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The exfiltration occurs at the requests.get call to an external URL, sending collected system data.",
  "flows": "Data from system information variables (hostname, cwd, username) flows directly into the parameters of the external GET request, which transmits the data to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The requests to a suspicious external URL (which appears to be a dynamic or obscured domain) during package installation, with no legitimate reason. The code embeds this behavior inside the install command, indicating possible data theft or malicious tracking. No other suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py script defines a custom installation command that, upon execution, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL that is likely malicious or at least suspicious. The URL appears to be obfuscated or dynamically generated. This behavior is hidden inside the package installation process, which could be exploited to perform unauthorized data collection or exfiltration. No other malicious actions such as code execution, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior in the form of data exfiltration during package installation, indicating potential supply chain sabotage or privacy violation. The external request to a suspicious domain during setup is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
