  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to send system information to a remote server during package installation.",

  "sinks": "requests.get() with constructed URL and parameters",
  "flows": "Gather hostname, current working directory, and username -> Send data via HTTP GET request to remote server during installation",
  "anomalies": "Code sends system information to an external server during package install without user consent, which is unusual. The URL is obfuscated or disguised, indicating potential malicious intent. Use of requests in setup script is uncommon and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools 'install' command with a custom run method. This method collects hostname, current directory, and username, then makes a GET request to a remote URL with this data. The URL appears obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious activity. The purpose seems to be exfiltration of system info during package installation, a malicious behavior. No validation or user consent is present, indicating a privacy violation or potential backdoor. The code does not perform any other obvious malicious actions but exfiltrates data without transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect and send system information to an external server during package installation, indicating malicious intent for data exfiltration. It is suspicious due to its covert data transmission and obfuscated URL.",
