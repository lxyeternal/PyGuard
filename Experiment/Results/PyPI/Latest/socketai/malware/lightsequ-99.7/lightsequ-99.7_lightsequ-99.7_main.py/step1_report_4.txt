  "anomalies": "Sends system hostname, username, current path, and a random number to multiple external domains without user consent; URLs are suspicious and appear designed for data collection or exfiltration; no apparent legitimate purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host information such as hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending the collected info as URL parameters. It then attempts to open each URL, effectively sending this data over the network. The code uses standard libraries but leverages them to transmit potentially sensitive system data to external servers. The domains and URL patterns suggest malicious or at least covert intent, possibly for tracking or data theft. No user interaction or legitimate purpose is evident, and the use of external URLs with system info indicates malicious data exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system information and sending it to suspicious external domains without user consent, indicating malicious intent related to data collection or exfiltration. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious backdoors but demonstrates malicious behavior via covert data transmission.",
