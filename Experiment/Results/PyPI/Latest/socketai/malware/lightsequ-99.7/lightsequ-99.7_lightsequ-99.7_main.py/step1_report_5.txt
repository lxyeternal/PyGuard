  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current path) -> URL construction -> HTTP request to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "URLs are obfuscated with unusual domain names, data is sent to multiple suspicious domains, no user consent or obvious legitimate purpose, data includes hostname, username, and current directory, which could be sensitive.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information including hostname, username, and current working directory. It constructs URLs with these parameters and a random number, then makes HTTP GET requests to external servers. The URLs appear suspicious and could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The data flow indicates potential privacy invasion, and the code does not include any user consent or legitimate reason for data transmission. The use of obfuscated domain names and sending data without user awareness is suspicious. No malicious payload like file modification or destructive actions is present, but the activity itself raises privacy concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system information and transmits it to suspicious domains without clear intent or user consent, indicating potentially malicious privacy-invasive behavior. While it does not perform destructive actions, its data exfiltration behavior is suspicious.",
