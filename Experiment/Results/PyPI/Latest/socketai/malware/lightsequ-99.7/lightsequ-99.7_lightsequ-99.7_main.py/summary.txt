  "conclusion": "The code performs covert collection and transmission of system information to suspicious external servers, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive activity. The scores should reflect high malware likelihood (~0.8) and security risk (~0.8), with no obfuscation. The activity warrants treating this code as malicious due to its data exfiltration behavior."
