  "flows": "System info variables (hostname, username, current_path) and a random number are encoded as URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious URLs with unusual domain names (oast.cn, oast.fun), sends system info to these URLs, and generates a random number for each request, which could be used for tracking or command control",
  "analysis": "The code gathers host information such as hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or testing domains. It sends HTTP GET requests with these parameters to remote servers, which could be used for data exfiltration, user tracking, or command-and-control purposes. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely used for monitoring or malicious activities. There are no evident code injection or data leakage issues within the code itself, but the behavior of collecting and transmitting system info to unknown domains raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and sends it to external URLs that appear suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent such as user tracking or data exfiltration. No explicit malware behavior like damage or reverse shells is present, but the network activity and remote data collection suggest a security risk.",
