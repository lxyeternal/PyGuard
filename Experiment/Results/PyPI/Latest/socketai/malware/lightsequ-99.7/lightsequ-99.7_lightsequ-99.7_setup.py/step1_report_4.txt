{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'lightsequ' package that customizes the installation process to execute a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from main.py during the custom install command execution.",
  "sinks": "The invocation of 'main()' from main.py, which could potentially execute arbitrary code if main.py is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method calls 'main()' from main.py, which may contain untrusted code execution.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' executes 'main()' post-install without any validation or restrictions. The class name itself is suspicious and suggests malicious intent. The setup script itself appears standard, but the post-install hook is unusual and potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py uses standard setuptools functions to configure package installation. The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' overrides 'run()' to execute 'main()' from main.py immediately after installation. This behavior is atypical and potentially malicious because it executes code upon package installation, which could be exploited to run arbitrary or malicious code on the user's system. The class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' hints at malicious intent. No other suspicious code, such as network connections or credential handling, is present. The 'install_requires' and 'setup_requires' dependencies are normal. The overall design raises security concerns due to automatic code execution during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious post-install hook that automatically executes 'main()' from main.py after installation. The class name and behavior suggest malicious intent, as it could run arbitrary code without user consent. This behavior warrants a security alert and should be reviewed or removed to prevent potential harm.",
