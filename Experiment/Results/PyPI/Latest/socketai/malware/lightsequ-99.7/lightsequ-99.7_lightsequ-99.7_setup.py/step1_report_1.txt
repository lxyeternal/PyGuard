{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'lightsequ' package that executes a main function from 'main' module after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from 'main' module within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' could potentially execute arbitrary code if 'main' contains malicious instructions.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method executes 'main()', which may run untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes 'main()' upon installation without any validation or restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after running the standard install procedure, imports and executes 'main()' from the 'main' module. This behavior can be dangerous if 'main' contains malicious code or was tampered with. The package dependencies are standard ('requests') and there are no suspicious or obfuscated parts of the code. However, executing 'main()' automatically during installation is unusual and could be exploited to run malicious code without user consent. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code is present. The malicious potential hinges on the content of 'main'.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. This behavior is suspicious and could be used to run malicious payloads post-installation without explicit user approval.",
