  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration and execute main() from main module during installation",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'setup' function parameters and imports from the 'main' module during installation",
  "sinks": "The 'main' function imported from 'main' is executed during installation, which could potentially run malicious code",
  "flows": "During the install process, the custom 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main' module, executing its code",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes 'main()' during setup, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main' contains harmful code",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup configuration for a Python package named 'lightsequ'. It overrides the install command to run a 'main()' function from the 'main' module after installation. The 'run' method executes 'main()' unconditionally during install, which could execute arbitrary code if 'main' is malicious or compromised. The setup specifies 'requests' as a required dependency, which is benign. The overall structure is typical for package setup, but executing external code during installation is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary suspicious aspect is the execution of 'main()' during installation, which could run malicious code if 'main' is compromised. The rest of the code appears standard for a setup script, but the deliberate execution during install warrants caution.",
