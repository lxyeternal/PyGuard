      "conclusion": "The setup script unconditionally executes 'main()' during installation, which is highly unusual and could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code. The class name and behavior suggest potential malicious intent. The risk and malware scores should be high, around 0.7-0.8, to reflect this concern. The actual maliciousness depends on the content of 'main()', which is unknown, but the pattern itself warrants caution."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert collection and transmission of system information to suspicious external servers, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive activity. The scores should reflect high malware likelihood (~0.8) and security risk (~0.8), with no obfuscation. The activity warrants treating this code as malicious due to its data exfiltration behavior."
