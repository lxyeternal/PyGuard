  "purpose": "Define versioning information for a software project using semantic versioning.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, _SUFFIX).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output operations present.",
  "flows": "Concatenation of version components into version strings (VERSION_SHORT and VERSION).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses static string assignments with simple formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version number components as static strings and constructs version strings via string formatting. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, nor suspicious behavior. The structure is standard for version definitions. No obfuscated or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines versioning variables using static values and simple string formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The purpose is purely to manage version information.",
