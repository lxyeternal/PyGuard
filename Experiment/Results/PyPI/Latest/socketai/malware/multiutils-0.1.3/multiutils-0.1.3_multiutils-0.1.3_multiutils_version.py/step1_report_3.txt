  "purpose": "Define versioning information for a software package, including major, minor, patch, and suffix components.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments and string formatting operations.",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted data or pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Variables _MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, and _SUFFIX are assigned static values; these are used in string formatting to generate version strings.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward version string assembly; no unusual constructs, obfuscation, or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code declares version components as static string variables. It constructs version strings using format strings. No input reading, no data leaks, and no dynamic or malicious code execution are present. The code appears to be standard version management code with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines and constructs version strings for a software package. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. It is typical version management code with no security concerns.",
