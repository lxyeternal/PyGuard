  "purpose": "Define version number components and format version strings for a software project.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals for version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, _SUFFIX).",
  "sinks": "Format strings used to generate VERSION_SHORT and VERSION variables.",
  "flows": "Concatenate hardcoded version components into formatted version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and uses standard string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code declares hardcoded version components as strings, then formats them into version strings. There are no input sources, no data processing from external or untrusted sources, and no sinks that could leak data or execute malicious actions. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to standard versioning conventions without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic versioning utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It merely constructs version strings from predefined literals. The code is safe and does not introduce security concerns.",
