  "purpose": "Define versioning information for the software package using semantic versioning.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments and string formatting statements.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version components to formatted version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic; straightforward version string definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, _SUFFIX) as string literals. It then constructs VERSION_SHORT and VERSION variables using string formatting. There are no external inputs, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to serve purely informational purposes for version management, aligned with semantic versioning standards.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign versioning scheme implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
