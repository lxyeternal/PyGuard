  "purpose": "Define and format version strings for the software release.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for version components (_MAJOR, _MINOR, _PATCH, _SUFFIX).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version components to formatted version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static and straightforward with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string variables representing version components and their formatted concatenations. It does not process any external input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores as zero. The code aligns with standard versioning practices and shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version string definition with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
