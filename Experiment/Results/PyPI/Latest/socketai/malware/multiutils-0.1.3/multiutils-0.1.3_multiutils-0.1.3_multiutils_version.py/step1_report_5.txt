  "flows": "Concatenation of hardcoded variables into version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious strings or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version components as strings and then constructs version strings through formatting. It does not read external input, does not include any network calls, file operations, or sensitive data handling. The code is straightforward and standard for version management. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. It simply sets and formats version numbers.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version declaration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines version strings for the package.",
