{
  "purpose": "The code provides a simple animated text display in the console, revealing one character at a time with a delay, and clearing the screen between each character.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input or untrusted data; uses internal parameters for timing and static text input provided via method argument.",
  "sinks": "Calls os.system to execute the clear command, which is a controlled and common way to clear terminal output; no other sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Method 'single_line_text' iterates over input text characters, updating display with delays, but does not process or execute untrusted data beyond displaying it.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; uses standard modules and straightforward logic. The clear command is invoked directly but in a safe, predictable manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an 'animation' class to animate text display in the terminal. It clears the terminal and updates the display one character at a time with a delay. No external input is read, and no data is transmitted or stored. The use of 'os.system' with 'clear' or 'cls' is typical for terminal manipulation, not malicious. There are no backdoors, malicious data handling, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for animated text display with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manipulates the terminal display using standard methods.",
