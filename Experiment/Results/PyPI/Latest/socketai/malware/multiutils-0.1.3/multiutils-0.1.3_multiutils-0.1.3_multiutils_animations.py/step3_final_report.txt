  "purpose": "Console text animation by printing characters one at a time with screen clearing between each character.",
  "sources": "The method parameter 'text' passed to single_line_text()",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls for clearing the console",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows from parameter to display; os.system() executes static commands based on OS",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with static commands; no dynamic or user-influenced command strings",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for animating text in the console by clearing the screen and printing one character at a time with delays. It uses os.system() with static commands ('cls' or 'clear') determined by OS, which are safe since they are not influenced by user input. No network activity, data leaks, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward and benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of os.system() is a minor concern but acceptable here due to static commands. The code does not process or transmit sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign console animation utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The existing reports correctly identify the safety and benign nature of the code, assigning appropriate low scores. No modifications are necessary.",
