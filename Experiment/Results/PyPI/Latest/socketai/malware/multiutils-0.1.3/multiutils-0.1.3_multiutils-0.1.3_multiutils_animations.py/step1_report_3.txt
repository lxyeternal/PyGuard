{
  "purpose": "This code provides a simple animation effect by printing text one character at a time with screen clearing between each character.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input; uses only the parameters provided and internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.system() to clear the console screen, which is a benign operation in this context.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from external sources to critical functions; the text is passed as an argument.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for animating text display by printing characters sequentially with delays, clearing the screen between each. It employs standard library functions for timing and system calls. No data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of os.system for clearing the console is typical for such animations and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign animation utility without any malicious or security risks. It simply animates text display in the console.",
