  "purpose": "This code provides a simple animated text display in the terminal, showing one character at a time with clearing the screen between each character.",
  "sources": "os.system call to clear the terminal screen; input parameter 'text' for the display function",
  "sinks": "os.system command execution to clear the console, which can potentially be manipulated if the command string is altered (though in this code, it's hardcoded safely).",
  "flows": "Input text -> for each letter, clear command -> print partial text -> sleep -> repeat until complete",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors; the clear command is standard for terminal animations. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an 'animation' class with methods to clear the terminal screen and display text one character at a time with a delay. The clear_cmd method uses os.system to execute 'cls' or 'clear' depending on OS, which is standard. The single_line_text method iterates through each character, clears the screen, prints the current partial text, then sleeps. There are no input validation, external data sources, or suspicious side effects. The code is straightforward and intended solely for visual animation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a harmless animated text display in the terminal with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It uses standard system calls and basic Python constructs, with no evidence of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads.",
