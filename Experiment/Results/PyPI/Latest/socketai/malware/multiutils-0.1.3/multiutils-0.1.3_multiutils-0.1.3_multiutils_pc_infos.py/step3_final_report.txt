  "purpose": "Retrieve the machine's public IP address via an external API call.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network through requests.get(\"https://api.ipify.org\")",
  "sinks": "The response text is returned directly; no untrusted data is used elsewhere in the code.",
  "flows": "Source: requests.get() fetches data from the external API; sink: return statement outputs the IP address.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. The code is straightforward and performs a benign network request.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, well-understood operation: fetching the public IP address. It does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads. The external request is to a reputable service. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0–0.2) are consistent with the benign nature. The minimal risk score reflects the external contact, which is standard for such functionality. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs a straightforward network request to retrieve the public IP address. The reported scores are appropriate and justified. Overall, the code poses negligible security risk.",
