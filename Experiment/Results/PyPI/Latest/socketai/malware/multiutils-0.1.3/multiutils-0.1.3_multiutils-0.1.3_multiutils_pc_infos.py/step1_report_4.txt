  "purpose": "Retrieve the public IP address of the system by making an HTTP GET request to a public API.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://api.ipify.org' used in requests.get() to fetch data.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function which outputs data that is returned by the function.",
  "flows": "Input is the URL string; the flow proceeds through requests.get(), and the response text is returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the requests library, defines a function get_ip() that performs a GET request to a public API to obtain the system's public IP address, and returns the response text. The operation appears straightforward and intended solely for retrieving network information. No data is being sent elsewhere, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The URL used is a well-known service for IP detection, and there are no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to fetch and return the public IP address. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
