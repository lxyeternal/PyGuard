  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code simply performs an HTTP GET request to a well-known IP service (https://api.ipify.org) and returns the response text.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior.\n- The function is straightforward and intended for a common purpose: retrieving the public IP address.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- The external API is reputable and commonly used for this purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- All reports agree that the code functions as intended and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The code is benign and does not exhibit any security issues.**\n\n---\n\n### Review of scores:\n\n| Report | malware | securityRisk | obfuscated |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0.2          | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0.1          | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n**Analysis:**\n- All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the reports' conclusion.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern about the code's benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since all reports and our review indicate no malicious or suspicious activity, the overall risk score should remain very low, likely close to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a straightforward, benign IP retrieval function.\n- No issues, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.",
