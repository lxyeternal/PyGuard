  "purpose": "Retrieve the public IP address of the system by making an HTTP GET request to an external API service.",
  "sources": "requests.get() call to 'https://api.ipify.org'",
  "sinks": "Return of the response text as the system's IP address",
  "flows": "Source: requests.get() fetches data from external API -> Sink: return statement outputs the IP address as a string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of external API is standard for obtaining public IP; no obfuscated code or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple function that makes an HTTP request to a known API to obtain the system's public IP address. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command and control communication, or backdoor activities. No suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present. The use of requests library for this purpose is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended solely to retrieve the public IP address via an external service. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks evident in this snippet.",
