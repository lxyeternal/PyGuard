  "purpose": "The code retrieves the public IP address of the system by sending an HTTP GET request to an external API.",
  "sources": "The request to 'https://api.ipify.org' to obtain external IP data.",
  "sinks": "The response text from the HTTP request, which contains the IP address.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the external API response to the return statement, providing the IP address.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard usage of requests library for an HTTP GET request to a known API.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'get_ip' that makes a GET request to a well-known API to retrieve the public IP address. The code uses the 'requests' library in a straightforward manner without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or unusual behaviors. The data flow is simple and predictable, and the purpose appears to be obtaining network information. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely to retrieve the public IP address, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
