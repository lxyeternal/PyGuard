  "purpose": "Retrieve the public IP address of the host machine by querying an external API.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://api.ipify.org' used in requests.get() for fetching data.",
  "sinks": "The output of requests.get().text which could be used for data exfiltration if misused.",
  "flows": "Code sends a request to an external service and returns the response text containing the IP address.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; usage of a common API for IP retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the requests library and defines a function get_ip() that fetches the public IP address by making an HTTP GET request to api.ipify.org. The response text is returned directly. The code performs a straightforward network request with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent. It does not handle exceptions, but that does not indicate malicious activity, only a potential robustness issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and performs a legitimate function of obtaining the machine's public IP address. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage. It is a standard implementation with no security risks identified.",
