  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'multiutils' Python project.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, find_packages() function, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, conventional setup code with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, defining package info with static parameters. No dynamic execution, external data, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign. Malware scores are zero, reflecting no malicious activity. Risk scores are minimal (~0.1 or zero), appropriate for static packaging scripts. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified based on the static, transparent nature of the code.",
