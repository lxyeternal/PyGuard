  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward `setup.py` script for packaging a Python project named 'multiutils'.\n- All reports agree that the code is static, standard, and free of dynamic input, external data handling, or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The only minor point is a very low security risk score (~0.1), which is reasonable given the static nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description. It imports `setuptools`, defines package metadata, uses `find_packages()`, specifies no dependencies, and enforces Python >=3.7.\n- **Malware presence:** No malware, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or hidden logic.\n- **Data flow:** All data are static; no external input or dynamic execution.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal, primarily because it's a standard setup script with no external data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or flaws:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no issues are found.\n- The security risk score is slightly above zero (~0.1), which seems appropriate given the static configuration and lack of external data handling.\n\n### Score justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard packaging script)\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard configuration risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the static, well-understood nature of the script.",
