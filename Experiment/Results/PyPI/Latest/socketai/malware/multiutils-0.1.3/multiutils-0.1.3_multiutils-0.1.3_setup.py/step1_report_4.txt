  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'multiutils' to specify package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data from the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or untrusted inputs are present.",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses static strings and function calls with no external input; no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, using standard setuptools functions with no unusual patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, packages to include, and requirements. All data used are static strings and function calls, with no dynamic execution, input reading, or network interactions. No suspicious or malicious code is present. The structure and syntax are conventional, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python module. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and normal for its intended purpose.",
