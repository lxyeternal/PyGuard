  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'multiutils' Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call and its parameters, particularly the find_packages() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with static package metadata, no dynamic or external input processing. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. All dependencies are empty, and no environment variables or credentials are used. The script appears to be a typical setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
