{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'multiutils', facilitating its distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data within the setup() function call, specifically package metadata and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "The static input (package info) flows into the setup process but does not involve external data or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be a standard setup script without obfuscated elements or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, such as name, version, packages, and dependencies. The 'find_packages()' function automatically discovers package modules. The 'install_requires' list is empty, indicating no external dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, no reading of external input, and no embedded secrets or obfuscated code. The script appears to be a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It serves the purpose of defining package metadata for distribution.",
