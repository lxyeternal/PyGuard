{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'multiutils' Python package",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration details such as name, version, packages, dependencies, and Python version requirements",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; setup configuration data is hardcoded and static",
  "flows": "The setup() function uses static parameters to prepare package metadata, with no dynamic data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets; the code strictly follows standard setup.py structure",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools modules, defines package metadata (name, version), determines packages with find_packages(), specifies no dependencies, and enforces a minimum Python version. There are no signs of malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior. The script appears to serve the standard purpose of packaging a Python project without any anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is straightforward, static, and aligns with typical Python packaging practices.",
