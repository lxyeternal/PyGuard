{
  "purpose": "This code imports version information and all public objects from a module named 'all'.",
  "sources": "Reading from the local module files 'version' and 'all'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; only module imports are performed.",
  "flows": "Imported version info could be used elsewhere; importing everything from 'all' may include untrusted or malicious code if the module is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .all import *' can obscure which components are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs relative imports of version variables and imports all contents from a sibling module. This is common in package __init__.py files. There are no evident malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns within this snippet itself. However, the import of everything from 'all' could potentially bring in malicious code if the 'all' module is compromised, but that cannot be determined solely from this fragment. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import pattern for Python packages, with no direct evidence of malicious intent. Its security risk is minimal unless the imported modules are compromised or contain malicious code. Overall, this appears benign.",
