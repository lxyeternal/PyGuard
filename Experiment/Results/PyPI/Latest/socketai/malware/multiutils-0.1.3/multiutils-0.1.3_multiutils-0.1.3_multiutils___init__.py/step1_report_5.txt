  "purpose": "Import version information and all symbols from the all module",
  "sources": "Imports from the local version module and all symbols from the local all module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; only import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .all import *' can be considered a potential anomaly due to unclear symbol importation, but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information variables from a local module and imports all symbols from another local module. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or network interactions. The use of relative imports is typical in package code. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, are evident. The only noteworthy point is the use of 'import *', which may impact code clarity but isn't inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
