{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, importing version information and all contents from a module named 'all'.",
  "sources": "Import statements: reading version info from .version and all contents from .all",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; just static imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .all import *' can be considered a potential concern due to namespace pollution, but not malicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements: one importing specific version variables and another importing everything from a module named 'all'. This is typical for package initialization. No code execution, external network communication, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of relative imports is standard for package structure. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization snippet, importing version info and all module contents. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
