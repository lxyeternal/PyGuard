  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n```python\nfrom .version import VERSION, VERSION_SHORT\nfrom .all import *\n```\nThis is a typical package `__init__.py` pattern, importing version info and all contents from a module named `all`. There are no evident dynamic behaviors, external network calls, or data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard package init, importing version info and all module contents.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no code execution, no external communication.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Slight concern over `import *`, but overall benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (due to `import *`), Confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The small risk score reflects the potential issues with `import *`.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard package code.\n- **Conclusion:** No risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** The concern is that importing everything from `all` could bring in malicious code if the module is compromised.\n- **Conclusion:** The report notes the potential but finds no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (due to potential risk with `import *`).\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The risk score accounts for the potential but unconfirmed threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected; standard import pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 (due to `import *`).\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The code only performs static imports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly elevated (0.2) in some reports mainly due to the use of `import *`, which can cause namespace pollution and maintenance issues, but not malicious.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code itself is benign; no malicious code, no data leaks, no external communications.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but common in package `__init__.py` files.\n- The risk scores should remain low, with a maximum of 0.2 reflecting the potential issues with namespace pollution, not malicious intent.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to `import *`, which can cause maintenance/security issues but not direct harm)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the actual code content.",
