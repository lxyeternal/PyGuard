  "purpose": "Package initialization, importing version info and all module contents",
  "sources": "Reading version variables from .version and importing all from .all",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication present",
  "flows": "Static import of version info and all module contents; no data flow or dynamic execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .all import *' which can cause namespace pollution but is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py pattern, importing version info and all module contents. No dynamic code, network calls, or data handling is present. The use of 'import *' is discouraged but common in package init files and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2) due to namespace pollution concern. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only concern is the use of 'import *', which is a known practice but not a security threat. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2). The overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
