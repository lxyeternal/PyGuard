  "purpose": "Import version information and all modules from the current package",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package modules (version and all)",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; simple imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .all import *' may indicate broad import, but this is common in package __init__.py files and not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and all contents from a local module. The use of relative imports suggests this is part of a package's __init__.py. No code execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior present. The 'import *' can be considered a code smell in general but is standard in package initialization scripts. No malicious intent or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of straightforward import statements within a package, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
