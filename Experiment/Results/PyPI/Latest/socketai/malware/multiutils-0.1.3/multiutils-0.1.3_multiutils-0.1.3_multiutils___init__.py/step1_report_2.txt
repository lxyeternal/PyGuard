{
  "purpose": "Import version information and all contents from a module, likely for package initialization or configuration.",
  "sources": "The code imports VERSION and VERSION_SHORT from a local module, and all symbols from another local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or user input sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; just static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .all import *' can be considered poor practice due to namespace pollution, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, involving relative imports of version variables and a wildcard import from a local module. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observable. The wildcard import may cause maintenance or security issues if unintended symbols are imported, but it does not suggest malicious intent. There are no external data sources, network calls, or code execution. The structure indicates typical package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement for package version info and modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only concern is the use of 'import *', which is a common but discouraged practice, not malicious.",
