  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a standard package initialization pattern, involving import statements for version info and a wildcard import from a local module. There are no signs of code execution, external communication, or data handling. The code appears benign and typical for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports consistently note that 'from .all import *' can be problematic due to namespace pollution but do not consider it malicious. This is accurate; it's a common practice but discouraged.\n- No report claims or implies that the code performs malicious actions, exfiltrates data, or contains obfuscated code.\n- The mention of potential security issues related to importing everything from 'all' is appropriate, but these are not actual vulnerabilities unless the imported module is compromised.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or 0.2, reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's benign nature, this seems appropriate.\n\n4. **Risk Score Higher than 0.5?**  \nNo. All scores are below 0.5, indicating low risk, which is justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports avoid speculative claims; they acknowledge that the use of 'import *' is a concern but not malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis: low risk, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (perhaps slightly higher than 0, but still very low)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a typical package __init__.py snippet with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of 'import *', which is a known bad practice but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Value | Justification                                               |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0            | No malicious activity detected                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            | Clear, straightforward import statements                   |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1          | Minimal risk due to namespace pollution concern, but benign |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with negligible security risk, and no malware or obfuscation present.",
