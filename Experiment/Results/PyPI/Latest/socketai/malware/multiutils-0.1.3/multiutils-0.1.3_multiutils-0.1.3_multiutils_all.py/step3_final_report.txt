{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and immediately transmits the system's IP address to an external Discord webhook, indicating potential data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "The function get_ip() invoked to retrieve system IP; the requests.post() call sending data to the external URL.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() function transmitting data over the network to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Source: get_ip() output -> sink: requests.post() with JSON payload containing IP -> external webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Immediate transmission of IP address upon import without user consent; hardcoded webhook URL; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules whose contents are unknown but likely benign. It calls get_ip() and sends the result via requests.post() to a hardcoded Discord webhook, immediately upon import. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system IP address, which is suspicious and privacy-invasive. The code is clear and straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The high malware scores in the reports (up to 0.8) are justified if the intent is malicious, but in isolation, this activity alone suggests privacy concerns rather than outright malware. The security risk score should reflect the potential for privacy invasion, around 0.6–0.8. Given the evidence, the activity warrants caution but does not confirm malicious payloads or destructive actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic exfiltration of the system's IP address to an external webhook, which is suspicious and potentially malicious depending on context. However, it lacks malicious payloads or obfuscation. The activity is privacy-invasive but not definitively malicious. The scores should be adjusted to reflect moderate security risk and low malware potential.",
