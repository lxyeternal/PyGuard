  "purpose": "The setup script executes a custom install class that, after installation, imports and runs main() from main.py, potentially executing arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "sources": "The run() method in CrazyInstallStrat calls import main and executes main() from main.py after standard installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() acts as a sink where untrusted code could run, leading to arbitrary code execution during install.",
  "flows": "The source is the call to main() in run(), which executes code from main.py; the flow is direct from import to execution during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of main() during installation without validation, validation, or safeguards; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after performing standard installation, imports main and executes main(). This pattern is risky because it runs external code during package installation without any validation, potentially executing malicious code if main.py is compromised. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The main concern is the arbitrary code execution at install time, which can be exploited for malicious purposes. The reports correctly identify this behavior as suspicious, with scores reflecting moderate suspicion. Given the behavior, the malware score should be increased to reflect the high potential for malicious activity, and the overall security risk should be elevated accordingly. Without inspecting main.py, certainty is limited, but the pattern itself warrants high caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes main() during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk. While the code appears benign, this pattern is often exploited for malicious purposes. The current reports' scores are reasonable but should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity and security risk.",
