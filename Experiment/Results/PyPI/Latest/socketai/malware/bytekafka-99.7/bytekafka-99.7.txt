      "conclusion": "The code executes main() during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk. While the code appears benign, this pattern is often exploited for malicious purposes. The current reports' scores are reasonable but should be adjusted upward to reflect the high potential for malicious activity and security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data collection and transmission to suspicious domains, which warrants security concern. It does not contain active malware or obfuscation, but its behavior is suspicious enough to justify a high security risk score. The malware likelihood is low, but the activity should be flagged for further review."
