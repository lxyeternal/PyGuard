{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it via HTTP GET requests to external URLs, potentially for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls with constructed URLs",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded into URL parameters and transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious, non-standard domains; data sent without validation; no obfuscation or payloads; dynamic URL construction",
  "analysis": "The script gathers identifiable system info and transmits it to external servers on suspicious domains, indicating potential covert data exfiltration or tracking. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads, but the behavior is suspicious due to the external contact points and data collection. The data flow from sources to sink is direct and unvalidated, raising privacy and security concerns. The malware score is low (around 0.2-0.3) because no active malicious payloads are present, but the high security risk score (~0.75) reflects the potential for privacy violations and covert activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data collection and transmission to suspicious domains, which warrants security concern. It does not contain active malware or obfuscation, but its behavior is suspicious enough to justify a high security risk score. The malware likelihood is low, but the activity should be flagged for further review.",
