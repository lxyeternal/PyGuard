  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), current user (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Makes HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system info and a random number as parameters, potentially sending untrusted data over the network.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, path, random number) is encoded as URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Sends system info to suspicious, non-legitimate domains; uses hardcoded URLs; generates a random number for request parameters; no user input validation. The URLs are non-standard and could be malicious C2 or data collection points.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system info (hostname, username, current directory) and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs with this data and attempts to access them over HTTP. The URLs appear suspicious and are hosted on domains associated with malicious or suspicious activities. The code does not perform any input validation or sanitization, but since it only gathers system info and sends it, the main concern is data exfiltration. The usage of urllib.request.urlopen indicates outbound network activity, which could be used for malicious tracking or command-and-control communications. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present, but the network behavior is suspicious and indicates possible malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for tracking or exfiltrating system data to suspicious external servers, indicating malicious or maliciously intended behavior. It does not perform any benign function beyond data collection and transmission to untrusted domains.",
