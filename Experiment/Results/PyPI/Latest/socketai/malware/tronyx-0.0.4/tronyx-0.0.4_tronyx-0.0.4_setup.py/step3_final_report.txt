  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for distributing a library named 'tronyx'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata (name, version, author, URL); dependencies specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no dynamic or untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools to package a Python library. It reads a local README.md file for the long description and specifies package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network activities, or obfuscated code. The repository URL points to a legitimate GitHub repository. All assessments from the reports align with this static, benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. The current scoring and assessment are accurate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
