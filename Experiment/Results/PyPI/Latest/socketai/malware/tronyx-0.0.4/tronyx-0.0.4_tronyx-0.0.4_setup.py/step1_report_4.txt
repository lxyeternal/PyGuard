  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'tronyx' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, package declaration, and dependency specification.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code only reads files and defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> Package setup parameters",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected. The only external interaction is reading a local file and setting package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary setup functions, reads the README file for the long description, and configures package metadata including name, version, author info, dependencies, and project URL. The code structure is standard for Python package setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious activity, such as network calls, credential handling, or code injection, is observed. It adheres to best practices for package configuration without any anomalies or signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a legitimate package configuration file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution with proper metadata.",
