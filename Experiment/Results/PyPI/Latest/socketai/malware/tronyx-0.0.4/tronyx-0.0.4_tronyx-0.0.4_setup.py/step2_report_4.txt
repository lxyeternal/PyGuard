  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**1. Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The setup script is benign, standard, and performs no suspicious activities.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code only reads a README file and sets package metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**2. Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming no malicious activity, straightforward setup.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No suspicious patterns or external data flows.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**3. Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; standard setup with no anomalies.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**4. Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a legitimate setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**5. Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking the code and reports:\n\n- The code is a typical `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It reads a local README.md file, defines dependencies (`requests`), and sets metadata.\n- There are no dynamic code executions, no external data processing, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The repository URL points to a GitHub repository, which appears legitimate.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports correctly assess the script as benign and standard. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, and no security risks.",
