  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**\n   - The code is a simple import statement: `from .tronyx import perm`.\n   - All reports agree that there are no data flows, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n   - The code snippet is minimal and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious indicators.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0 or 0.1, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also low, generally 0 or 0.2.\n   - Confidence levels are high (0.6 to 0.9), appropriate for such minimal code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable given the evidence.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or vulnerabilities that warrant a high risk score.\n   - The highest risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate for minimal import statements.\n\n5. **Malware scores:**\n   - All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n   - Since the code only performs an import, and there's no indication of malicious behavior, these scores are justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No reports make unwarranted assumptions; all base their conclusions on the minimal code snippet.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just a simple import statement)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The module name `.tronyx` is somewhat unconventional but not suspicious in itself.\n- Without further context or code, there's no reason to suspect malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1             |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no security concerns. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
