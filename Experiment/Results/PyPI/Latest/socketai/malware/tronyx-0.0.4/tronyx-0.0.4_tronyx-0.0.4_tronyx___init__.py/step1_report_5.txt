  "analysis": "The code simply imports 'perm' from a local module '.tronyx'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities in this single line. The module name '.tronyx' might be unconventional, but without additional context, it does not suggest malicious intent. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or any network activity. Its security risk appears low based solely on this snippet.",
