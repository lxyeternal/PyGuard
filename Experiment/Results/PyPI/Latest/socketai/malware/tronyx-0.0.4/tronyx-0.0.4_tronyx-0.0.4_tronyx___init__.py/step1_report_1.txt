  "purpose": "The code imports the 'perm' object or function from a module named 'tronyx' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'tronyx'.",
  "sinks": "Import statement itself; no data or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Importing 'perm' from 'tronyx' without further processing; no data flow or execution flow evident beyond the import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement, importing 'perm' from a relative module 'tronyx'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or other potentially malicious operations. The import is typical for modular Python code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase with no malicious behavior evident.",
