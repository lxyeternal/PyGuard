  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'tronyx'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement that reads the 'tronyx' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module 'tronyx'. There are no functions, data processing, or network interactions. This is a standard import and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. There is no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden logic present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a normal part of a Python project structure.",
