{
  "purpose": "The code executes an external executable ('your_executable.exe') during the installation process without validation, user confirmation, or signature verification, posing a security risk.",
  "sources": "The executable path is constructed based on the installation directory: 'pojang_resorter/your_executable.exe'. The code reads the installation directory and checks for the executable's existence.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run([exe_path]) call executes the external executable, which could lead to code execution, system compromise, or malicious payloads if the executable is malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "The source is the installation directory path; the sink is the subprocess call executing the executable; the flow is from the constructed path to execution during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of an external executable during package installation without validation, signature check, or user consent; hardcoded executable filename; no error handling beyond check=True.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to 'your_executable.exe' within the package directory, checks for its existence, and executes it during installation. This behavior is suspicious because it runs external code without validation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes. The executable's presence is not verified for integrity or authenticity. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns, where malicious payloads are embedded and executed during setup. The malware score is justified at approximately 0.75, reflecting high suspicion of malicious intent, especially given the lack of safeguards. The security risk score is similarly high (~0.75), as executing unvalidated external code during install is dangerous. The obfuscation score is 0, as the code is clear. Overall, the behavior warrants caution, and the scores appropriately reflect the potential threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code unconditionally executes an external executable during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk and potential for malicious activity. The behavior is suspicious and aligns with supply chain attack patterns. The assigned malware and risk scores are justified; they indicate high suspicion but do not confirm malicious payloads. Further validation of the executable's integrity and purpose is recommended before deployment.",
