{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process for the 'pojang_resorter' package, which runs an executable after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the path to an executable file ('your_executable.exe') in the package directory during installation.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True) executes the specified executable, which could be malicious if the executable is harmful or tampered with.",
  "flows": "The code constructs the executable path during install, checks its existence, and then runs it using subprocess, which executes code from the executable.",
  "anomalies": "Running an executable unconditionally during installation without validation is suspicious. The code does not verify the integrity or origin of the executable. The executable's name ('your_executable.exe') is generic, but the act of executing a file during install is a potential security concern.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setuptools install command to include post-installation behavior. It constructs a path to a specific executable within the installed package directory. If this executable exists, it runs it directly. This behavior is unusual because running external executables automatically during package installation can be malicious if the executable is malicious or has been tampered with. The code does not perform any validation or integrity checks on the executable. The use of subprocess.run() with check=True means the executable must run successfully or raise an error, which could halt installation if malicious or problematic. The code does not include any obfuscation, but the behavior itself raises security concerns due to the execution of an external file without validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code's behavior of executing an external executable during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially since there is no verification or validation. This could be exploited to run malicious code on the target system. The overall security risk is high given this pattern.",
