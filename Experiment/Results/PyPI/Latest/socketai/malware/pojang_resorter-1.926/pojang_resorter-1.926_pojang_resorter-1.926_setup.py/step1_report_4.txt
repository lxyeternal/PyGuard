  "purpose": "Custom installation process for the 'pojang_resorter' package that runs an executable post-installation.",

  "flows": "Check existence of executable -> run executable if exists",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of an external executable during post-install, hardcoded executable path",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during the post-install phase, constructs a path to 'your_executable.exe' inside the package directory. It then checks if this executable exists and runs it if present. The executable path is hardcoded, and the script blindly executes it without user consent or validation. This behavior can be malicious if the executable is malicious or if the code is repurposed maliciously, as it runs arbitrary code during installation. No other suspicious or malicious code, such as data exfiltration or network communication, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an executable located within the package during installation, which can be malicious if the executable is harmful. The installation process is modified to run an external file without explicit user approval, posing a potential security risk.",
