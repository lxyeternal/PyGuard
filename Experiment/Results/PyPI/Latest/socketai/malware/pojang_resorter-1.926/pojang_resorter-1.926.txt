      "conclusion": "The code unconditionally executes an external executable during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk and potential for malicious activity. The behavior is suspicious and aligns with supply chain attack patterns. The assigned malware and risk scores are justified; they indicate high suspicion but do not confirm malicious payloads. Further validation of the executable's integrity and purpose is recommended before deployment."
