  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the provided snippet is solely a comment containing licensing information. There is no executable code, data input/output, or logic present. Therefore, there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly state that the code is only a comment and pose no security concerns. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a confidence of 1 (or 1.0), with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores all at 0. This is appropriate given the nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**  \nSince the code is purely a comment with no executable content, malware and risk scores should remain at 0. Any higher score would be unjustified unless future code introduces malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the snippet as a benign license comment.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. All reports agree on the absence of risk or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is only a license comment, which poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The snippet is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.  \n- Confirm that the code is safe and contains no hidden or malicious content.\n\n**This analysis confirms that the code snippet is safe and poses no security risk.**",
