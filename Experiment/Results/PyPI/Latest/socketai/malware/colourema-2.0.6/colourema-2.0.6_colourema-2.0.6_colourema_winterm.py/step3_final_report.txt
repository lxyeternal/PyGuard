  "purpose": "A Windows-specific console management library providing functions for setting colors, styles, cursor position, clearing screen/lines, and enabling VT processing, utilizing Windows API calls.",
  "sources": "Reads console handle information, console screen buffer info, and environment via win32 API functions; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Modifies console attributes, cursor position, and screen buffer; no data leaks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "API calls from functions to system console handles, affecting console state without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; standard API usage and error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts solely with Windows console APIs to control terminal appearance and behavior. It includes functions for setting text attributes, cursor positioning, clearing screen/lines, and enabling VT processing. All API calls are standard and well-structured. No external data is processed, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The purpose is to facilitate terminal control in Windows environments, with proper error handling and environment checks. The enable_vt_processing function attempts to activate terminal features in a typical, legitimate manner. The code does not contain any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious Windows console utility library. It performs standard terminal control functions without any malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with its purpose.",
