{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to control Windows console appearance and behavior, such as setting text color, style, cursor position, and clearing parts of the console screen.",
  "sources": "Imports from system libraries (msvcrt, win32), and methods that read console buffer info and environment handles.",
  "sinks": "Methods that set console text attributes, cursor positions, or clear screen lines potentially affecting console display. No untrusted data inputs are directly processed.",
  "flows": "Code reads console buffer info and environment handles (sources), then uses these to modify console state via API calls (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code mainly wraps Windows console API calls for display management. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a set of classes to manage console text attributes, cursor movement, and screen clearing on Windows. It imports system modules for console control and defines functions to enable virtual terminal processing. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious system modifications are evident. All functions serve legitimate console management purposes. No obfuscation or malicious behavior patterns are detected. The only notable aspect is the enabling of VT processing, which is standard for advanced console features. No external inputs are used maliciously, and no data is exfiltrated or covert channels are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Windows console management library, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It solely wraps Windows API calls to control console appearance and behavior, with no evidence of supply chain attacks or embedded malware.",
