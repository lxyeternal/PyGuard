  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for terminal handling classes, with no malicious or sabotage behavior. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriately zero. Slightly elevated risk scores (around 0.1) reflect system call mocking but are justified within a controlled testing environment."
