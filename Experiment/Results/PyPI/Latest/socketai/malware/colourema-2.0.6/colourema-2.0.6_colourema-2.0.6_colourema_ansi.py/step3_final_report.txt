{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, cursor movement, and screen control.",
  "sources": "Functions and methods generating escape sequences based on input parameters; no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only constructs escape sequences without processing untrusted data or performing external actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, cursor positions) flow into functions that produce escape sequences; no external data flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is static, straightforward, and lacks obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, functions, and classes for ANSI escape sequences used for terminal styling and cursor control. It does not handle external inputs, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The implementation is clear, static, and adheres to standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility library for terminal styling with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
