  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and evaluate the security implications.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities**  \nAll reports consistently describe the code as a standard utility module for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling and cursor control. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, input handling from untrusted sources, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code strictly defines constants, functions, and classes to produce escape sequences, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nThe code appears well-structured and free of errors. The functions and classes serve their purpose as utility generators for ANSI codes. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident from the provided code snippets or reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward, readable implementation.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable because the code does not introduce security risks.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not assume any vulnerabilities or malicious intent. They correctly identify this code as a benign utility library.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. Since there are no signs of malicious behavior, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n\n- No changes needed; the scores accurately reflect the code's benign nature.\n- The code can be considered safe for use in any terminal styling context.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-implemented utility for ANSI escape sequences with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
