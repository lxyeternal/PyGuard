{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling, including colors, cursor movements, and screen manipulations.",
  "sources": "The code defines static constants and functions; it does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points that process untrusted data are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; functions return static or computed ANSI escape sequences.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines constants and functions to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal styling. The classes initialize attributes with escape sequences but do not perform any I/O or network communication. No input reading, data manipulation, or external interaction occurs. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated logic or hidden code. It serves as a utility library for terminal formatting, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for terminal styling using ANSI escape codes. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured library without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
