{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for printing colored text and controlling cursor and screen behavior in terminal outputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it defines constants, functions, and classes for ANSI code generation.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs ANSI escape sequences, which are used to control terminal display but do not directly lead to data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The functions convert input parameters (such as color codes, cursor positions) into ANSI escape sequences for terminal output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of definitions for ANSI escape codes, functions to generate control sequences, and classes to organize these codes. It appears to be a standard implementation of terminal control sequences with no signs of malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no external input handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. It simply provides utilities for terminal coloring and cursor control, which are common in CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for terminal color and cursor control with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or harmful behavior, and its purpose is benign.",
