{
  "purpose": "The code generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Definitions of ANSI escape sequences, class attributes, and functions that return escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that produce escape sequences based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (like color codes or cursor positions) flow into functions that generate escape sequences, which are returned as strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The module primarily defines constants and functions to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. It includes classes for text foreground and background colors, styles, and cursor controls, initializing instance attributes with escape sequences upon object creation. All code appears to be static, well-structured, and intended for terminal UI formatting. There are no inputs from external sources, no network communication, no handling of sensitive data, nor any code that could be malicious or maliciously manipulated. The code's purpose aligns with standard terminal control libraries without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for terminal text formatting using ANSI escape sequences. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a safe, static library intended for visual enhancement in terminal applications.",
