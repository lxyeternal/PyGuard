  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard ANSI escape code utility library.\n- No external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is reported.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code's purpose is benign: providing terminal styling and cursor control functions.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all zero or very low, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Checks:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** No issues or vulnerabilities are indicated or evident. The code is straightforward and static.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** None noted; the implementation appears correct and standard.\n- **Scores assigned:** All are consistent with the reports’ reasoning; no adjustments needed.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code only generates escape sequences for terminal control, the risk is inherently low. No high scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None. The code does not handle external input or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard utility library for ANSI escape sequences.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements are present.\n- The overall risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, well-structured ANSI escape code utility for terminal styling. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The existing scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
