  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "Definitions of color codes, style codes, and functions for generating ANSI sequences.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations that produce ANSI escape sequences for terminal control.",
  "flows": "Functions and class methods produce escape sequences based on class attributes and parameters, forming ANSI codes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code relies solely on standard ANSI sequences and standard class attribute values.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for generating ANSI escape codes used for terminal text formatting and cursor positioning. It constructs escape sequences via straightforward string concatenation, with no external data inputs, network connections, or environment variable manipulations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident. The design is typical for terminal formatting libraries, with clear and safe implementation. No obfuscation or hidden code features detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ANSI escape code generator for terminal styling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
