  "purpose": "Generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "Constants defining ANSI codes, functions constructing escape sequences, class initializations wrapping codes with escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Return statements constructing escape sequences, potentially used to manipulate terminal output, cursor position, or text styles.",
  "flows": "Code defines static mappings and functions; no flow of untrusted data, input, or external data sources to outputs or terminal commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The module strictly provides utility functions and classes for creating ANSI escape sequences for terminal display purposes. It initializes class attributes with escape sequences wrapping static numeric codes. No external input, data parsing, or untrusted data handling occurs. The functions generate escape sequences based solely on internal constants or method parameters with no external data influence. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or system tampering. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility library for terminal styling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of ANSI escape code generators for terminal styling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious functionality. It is safe to use as a terminal styling utility.",
