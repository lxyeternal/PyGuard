{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Windows-specific API wrapper for manipulating console properties such as text color, cursor position, title, and console modes, primarily using ctypes to interface with kernel32.dll functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment-specific handles via GetStdHandle; it reads console state info via GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo; it reads console mode using GetConsoleMode.",
  "sinks": "Functions that set console attributes, cursor position, title, or mode (SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitle, SetConsoleMode) could potentially modify console state but do not handle untrusted input within this code.",
  "flows": "Input (e.g., handle, position, title string, mode) flows into functions like SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitle, and SetConsoleMode, which then invoke Windows API calls to modify console state.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard Windows API wrapper with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual logic is present. The functions are straightforward API calls without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script loads Windows console management functions via ctypes, provides functions to get console info, set text attributes, cursor position, title, and mode. It gracefully handles environments where ctypes or Windows DLLs are unavailable, avoiding errors. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware behaviors. The code simply interfaces with system APIs to manage console properties, which is benign functionality. No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Windows console utility wrapper for managing console appearance and behavior. It does not contain malware or malicious code and poses no significant security risks beyond standard console manipulation capabilities. The implementation is straightforward and appropriate for its purpose.",
