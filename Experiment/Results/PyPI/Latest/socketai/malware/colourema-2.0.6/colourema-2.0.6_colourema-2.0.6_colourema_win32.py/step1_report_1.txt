{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of utility functions for interacting with the Windows console API, including setting text attributes, cursor position, console title, and buffer info.",
  "sources": "Imports ctypes and wintypes; retrieves handles via GetStdHandle; reads console buffer info and mode; modifies console properties.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies console display properties, which could be used for UI manipulation or deception, but no direct data exfiltration or malicious system control is present.",
  "flows": "Uses handles from standard output/error; calls Windows API functions to read or modify console state; no untrusted input flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard Windows console manipulation; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The functions are typical for console UI control.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for console manipulation on Windows systems using ctypes. It includes handling for missing modules and cross-platform considerations. No code injection, network communication, or system damage routines are present. The functions do not accept or process external untrusted data inputs in a malicious manner. The code is well-structured for console control, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. Overall, it appears to be utility code for enhancing console UI interactions, with no malicious or malicious-sounding behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for Windows console management. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The functions are standard and do not perform any harmful actions or exfiltrate data.",
