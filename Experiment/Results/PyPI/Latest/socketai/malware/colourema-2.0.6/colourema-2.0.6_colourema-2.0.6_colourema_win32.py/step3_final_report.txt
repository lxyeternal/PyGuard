{
  "purpose": "This code provides Windows console API wrapper functions for manipulating console properties such as text attributes, cursor position, and title, primarily for terminal UI control.",
  "sources": "Reads from standard handles (_GetStdHandle), console info functions (_GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo), and input parameters like stream identifiers, text attributes, positions, and titles.",
  "sinks": "Uses untrusted input in functions like SetConsoleTitle, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacter, and FillConsoleOutputAttribute, which can affect terminal display but do not leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (titles, positions, attributes) flow into console API functions that modify terminal state; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses standard Windows API calls for console management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions wrapping Windows console API calls for manipulating terminal display properties. It includes environment detection, proper API setup, and functions for setting text attributes, cursor position, console title, and output formatting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The code is benign, intended for terminal UI control, and does not exfiltrate data or establish network connections. The risk associated with console manipulation is minimal and context-dependent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1, justified by potential misuse but no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Windows console utility module with no malicious or sabotage behavior. It poses minimal security risk and is not obfuscated. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
