{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of functions for interacting with the Windows console, such as setting text attributes, cursor position, and console title, primarily for use in terminal-based applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'ctypes' library, specifically functions from 'kernel32' such as GetStdHandle, GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, and SetConsoleMode.",
  "sinks": "Functions that modify console properties, potentially affecting display or behavior of the terminal, but no untrusted input or external data sources are explicitly handled or used to influence these functions.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves console handles and manipulates console properties through defined functions, with no data flow from external or untrusted sources to critical sink functions. The functions are designed for console UI management rather than data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard Windows API calls for console management. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The only notable aspect is the conditional import handling and fallback lambdas, which are standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of functions wrapping Windows API calls to manipulate console output, cursor position, and console properties. It includes proper type definitions, argument types, and error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or covert operations. The functions are purely for terminal management, and no external data or input is used in a malicious way. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the functions are safe for use in legitimate applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Windows console management utility, with no malicious behavior detected. It provides useful functions for terminal handling without any signs of malicious intent or supply chain risks.",
