{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with Windows console API for managing console display attributes, cursor position, and buffer information.",
  "sources": "Imports ctypes and wintypes; accesses Windows kernel32.dll functions such as GetStdHandle, GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode.",
  "sinks": "Uses Windows API calls that can modify console appearance and behavior, potentially affecting display or retrieving console information.",
  "flows": "Reads handle info via _GetStdHandle -> obtains console buffer info -> modifies console properties like text attribute, cursor position, title, or console mode.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Functions perform standard Windows console API interactions; no obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or privacy leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally loads Windows console API functions using ctypes, defines helper functions for console manipulation, and handles errors via WinError exceptions. It provides standard API access without any suspicious data handling, network calls, or stealth features. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are present. The code is well-structured and appears to be utility functions for console management, typical for Windows-specific CLI tools.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides legitimate Windows console API wrappers without any signs of malicious behavior. It focuses on console display control, which is common in CLI applications. No malware or security risks are identified.",
