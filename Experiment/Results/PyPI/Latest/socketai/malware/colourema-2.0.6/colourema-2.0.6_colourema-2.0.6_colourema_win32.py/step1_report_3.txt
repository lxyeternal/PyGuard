{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to interact with Windows console API, including handling console buffer info, text attributes, cursor position, console title, and console modes.",
  "sources": "Imports from ctypes and Windows DLLs, especially functions like GetStdHandle, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode.",
  "sinks": "Functions that modify console state such as SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitle, SetConsoleMode, FillConsoleOutputCharacterA, FillConsoleOutputAttribute.",
  "flows": "Source functions (like _GetStdHandle) retrieve console handles; data flows into functions that modify console properties; functions like SetConsoleTextAttribute and SetConsoleCursorPosition act as sinks modifying console output or appearance.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity. The code is a straightforward wrapper around Windows console API functions, primarily for console manipulation. The code structure is standard, and no malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Windows-specific DLL functions to manipulate console properties, including text attributes, cursor position, console title, and console modes. It includes functions to get console info, set console text attributes, move the cursor, fill console output, and manage console modes, all via well-known Windows API calls. These are typical utilities for console-based applications. There is no evidence of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be intended for legitimate console management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of Windows console API wrappers intended for manipulating console appearance and behavior. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected. It functions as a utility module for console interactions.",
