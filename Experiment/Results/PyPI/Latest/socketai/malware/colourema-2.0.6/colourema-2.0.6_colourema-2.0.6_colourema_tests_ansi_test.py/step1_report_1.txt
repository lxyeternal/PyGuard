  "purpose": "Unit tests for ANSI escape code definitions and behavior in the ansi and ansitowin32 modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from the parent package (..ansi and ..ansitowin32), and standard library (sys, unittest).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "The code runs assertions on static ANSI escape code constants; no data flows or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward test cases for predefined constants and module behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class to verify ANSI color and style constants. It imports modules, performs assertions to check the correctness of color/style codes, and restores sys.stdout/stderr in setup/teardown. There are no input sources from untrusted origins, no sinks that send data externally, and no data flows beyond internal assertions. No dynamic code execution, no environment variable usage, and no network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard unit testing module verifying ANSI code constants; it contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
