  "purpose": "Static verification of ANSI escape code constants for colors and styles.",
  "sources": "Importing from local modules (`..ansi`, `..ansitowin32`), static assertions on predefined constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "None; purely static assertions on constants.",
  "anomalies": "None; code only verifies static values, no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying ANSI escape code constants for foreground, background, and style attributes. It imports from local modules and performs static assertions without processing untrusted input or performing external operations. The setup and teardown methods manipulate system streams but do not execute untrusted code or external commands. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static unit test verifying ANSI escape sequences. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity are present. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
