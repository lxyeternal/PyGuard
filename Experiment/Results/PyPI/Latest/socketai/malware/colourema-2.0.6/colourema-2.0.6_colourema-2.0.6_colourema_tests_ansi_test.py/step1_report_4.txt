  "purpose": "Unit tests for ANSI escape code definitions and their correctness",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, unittest, and local modules (ansi, ansitowin32); usage of sys.stdout and sys.stderr",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; tests only verify static attribute values and restore stdout/stderr",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; test assertions are static and do not process external input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying ANSI escape code constants defined in local modules. It checks the correctness of color, style, and background attribute values. The setup and teardown methods ensure the original stdout and stderr are restored, but do not involve external data or system commands. There are no indications of malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no suspicious code patterns. The code is purely for testing static constants and does not include any network, file manipulation, or dynamic code execution beyond standard unittest practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite verifying ANSI code constants. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, poses no security risks, and is only intended for validation purposes.",
