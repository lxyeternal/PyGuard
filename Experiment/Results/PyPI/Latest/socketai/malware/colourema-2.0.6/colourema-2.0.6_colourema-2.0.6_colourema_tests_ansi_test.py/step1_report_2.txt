  "purpose": "Unit testing for ANSI escape sequences in terminal styling libraries",
  "sources": "Import statements, attribute definitions in Fore, Back, Style classes, and test methods",
  "sinks": "No sink points present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; mainly static attribute checks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party testing modules and performs attribute value assertions for color and style codes. It verifies that certain ANSI escape sequences are correctly defined, with no dynamic code execution, data input, or network interactions. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and primarily for validation purposes. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or obfuscated code. No external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for verifying ANSI color and style escape sequences. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity. It is safe and intended for testing the correctness of ANSI code definitions.",
