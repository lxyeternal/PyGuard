{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to handle ANSI escape sequences, convert them into Win32 API calls on Windows, and wrap output streams such as stdout and stderr to support colored or styled terminal output across platforms.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from wrapped streams (e.g., sys.stdout, sys.stderr) via methods like write() and through environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Data output to wrapped streams (stdout/stderr), potentially including converted ANSI sequences into system calls or stripped sequences. No data is sent over the network or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "Input from wrapped streams flows through write() or write_and_convert(), where ANSI sequences are detected, parsed, and potentially converted into Win32 API calls. The code also reads environment variables and terminal capabilities to determine behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. The only processing is related to ANSI sequence parsing and conversion for styling terminal output. No suspicious or malicious system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines stream wrappers to facilitate styled output, converting ANSI codes to native Windows calls when necessary. It carefully checks environment conditions and terminal capabilities to decide whether to strip or convert sequences. No external data transmission, malicious command execution, or hidden behaviors are present. The functions and classes perform standard terminal styling tasks with proper separation of concerns. Overall, the code is consistent with legitimate terminal handling libraries and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility for handling ANSI sequences across platforms with no indication of malicious intent. It performs standard styling conversions and stream wrapping, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
