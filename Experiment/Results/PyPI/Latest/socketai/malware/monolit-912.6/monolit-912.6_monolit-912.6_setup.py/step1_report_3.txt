  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'monolit' Python package that customizes the installation process to run a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and executes 'main()' from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' from main.py; potential if main() contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method calls 'main()' from main.py, which may execute untrusted code if 'main()' is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' immediately executes 'main()' during installation without any validation or checks, which is unusual and potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules to define package setup parameters. The custom class 'CrazyInstallStrat' overrides the 'run' method to call 'install.run(self)' and then executes 'main()' from an external module 'main'. This behavior triggers 'main()' upon installation, which could execute arbitrary or malicious code if 'main()' contains malicious instructions. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation, but the immediate execution of external code during installation is a notable security concern. The setup configuration appears standard, but the execution of external code without validation is a significant anomaly.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious pattern where it executes 'main()' from main.py during installation, which could run arbitrary code. This practice is suspicious and could lead to malicious behavior, especially if 'main()' is compromised or malicious. It warrants caution and further review of 'main.py'.",
