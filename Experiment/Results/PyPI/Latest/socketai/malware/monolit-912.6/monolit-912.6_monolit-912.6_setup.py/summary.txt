  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant supply chain security risk. Without validation of 'main.py', this could be exploited for malicious purposes. The behavior is suspicious and warrants further review of 'main.py'. The scores in the reports are reasonable but should be adjusted to reflect the high risk associated with arbitrary code execution during setup."
