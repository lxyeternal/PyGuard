  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple external URLs, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) which sends data to external servers",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) flows from sources to URL parameters, then to external servers via HTTP requests",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs URLs with suspicious domains and uses hardcoded URLs that may be used for tracking or malicious purposes; also, the random number generation could be for session tracking or fingerprinting.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers basic system information such as hostname, username, and current working directory. It then constructs URLs with these parameters along with a random number, and makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs. The domains used are suspicious and do not belong to legitimate services; they could be used to collect data or track users without consent. The use of random numbers in URLs may serve as unique identifiers or for tracking purposes. There is no evidence of malicious payload execution, code injection, or system damage. However, the activity suggests covert data exfiltration or tracking behavior. No hardcoded credentials or dangerous code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform system reconnaissance and exfiltration of basic environment data to external, suspicious domains. While it does not execute malicious payloads, it exhibits potentially malicious tracking or data collection behavior without user consent. No evidence of malware or obfuscation was found, but the activity warrants caution due to suspicious domains and data transmission.",
