  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests with system info and a random number embedded in the URL to external servers using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory) and a random number are embedded as URL parameters and sent to each remote URL via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains (oast.cn, oast.fun) associated with testing or tracking. Data is sent to these URLs unencrypted via GET requests. No validation or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be data exfiltration or tracking without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system information and a random number, then constructs URLs to send this data via GET requests. The URLs are suspicious and may be used for malicious tracking or data collection. No user input validation, no encryption, and no indication of benign use. The code operates silently in the background, indicating potential malicious intent or privacy invasion. The lack of any other functional purpose or safeguards suggests an intent to monitor or exfiltrate data covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to silently collect system information and send it to external domains, likely for tracking or malicious data collection. The use of suspicious domains and unencrypted data transfer, combined with the silent execution, suggests malicious behavior.",
