{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string and a safety token, potentially for use in a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "The safety token '__safety_token__' is a hardcoded Base64-encoded string, which could be decoded to reveal its content.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code imports 'b64decode' but does not invoke it. No data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable within this code fragment. If the token is decoded elsewhere, it could reveal potentially malicious content.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a Base64-encoded string assigned to '__safety_token__' could indicate an embedded payload or hidden data. The string decodes to a URL, which may be used for contacting an external server.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'b64decode' but does not use it directly; this suggests potential future use or obfuscation. The '__safety_token__' contains a Base64 string, which decodes to a URL and a command-like string, possibly for external communication. No other suspicious or malicious behavior is directly evident in this fragment. The presence of encoded data hints at potential misuse or hidden intentions if decoded and used improperly.",
  "conclusion": "The code by itself is minimal and does not exhibit malicious activity; however, the embedded Base64 string decodes to a URL, which could be part of malicious behavior if used for external communication or command-and-control purposes. The snippet's intention might be benign, but caution is advised if integrated with other code.",
