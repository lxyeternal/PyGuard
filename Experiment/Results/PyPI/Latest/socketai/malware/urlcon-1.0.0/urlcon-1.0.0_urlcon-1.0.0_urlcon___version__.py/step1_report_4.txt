{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string and a safety token, possibly for use in a larger module or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string variables (__version__ and __safety_token__). It also imports the 'b64decode' function from the 'base64' module.",
  "sinks": "The decoded content from __safety_token__ could be used in network requests or code execution if further processed, though no such usage is shown here.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow is demonstrated in this snippet beyond defining variables; if the token is decoded and used elsewhere, that could represent a flow.",
  "anomalies": "The __safety_token__ is a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, reveals a URL and potentially executable code. The variable name suggests it might be a security or safety-related token, but the encoded string appears to encode a URL and a command or script. This warrants further analysis of the decoded content.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'b64decode' but does not demonstrate its use within this snippet. The __safety_token__ variable contains a base64-encoded string. Decoding this string yields a URL ('https://pastebin.com/raw/BQCvZd82') and what appears to be an invocation of a function or script ('POOLEngine()') with a request to the decoded URL. This suggests the code might be designed to retrieve or execute remote content, potentially malicious if used improperly. The code snippet itself is minimal, but the presence of an encoded string pointing to an external URL and including executable-like content indicates a potential security risk if decoded and used in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet on its own does not perform malicious actions but contains a base64-encoded string referencing an external URL and a possible script call, which could be exploited if decoded and executed elsewhere. The use of a safety token with encoded content should be reviewed carefully, especially if used in a larger codebase, as it hints at possible remote code fetching or execution.",
