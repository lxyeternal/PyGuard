{
  "purpose": "The code defines a version string and a safety token, with no immediate functional behavior shown.",
  "sources": "The safety token appears to be a base64-encoded string, likely containing data or code, but is not decoded or used within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is outputted or executed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the encoded string is not decoded or processed further in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded string labeled as a safety token could be suspicious if it were decoded, as it may contain malicious code or sensitive data. However, it is not used here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 decode function and assigns it an alias. It defines a version string and a base64-encoded safety token. The token is not decoded or executed, and no other actions are performed. The encoded string could potentially contain malicious code or data, but in this snippet, it remains unused. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign in its current form, merely defining constants and importing a decoding function without executing or decoding the encoded string. There is no immediate evidence of malicious behavior, but the presence of an encoded token warrants further review if the token is used elsewhere.",
