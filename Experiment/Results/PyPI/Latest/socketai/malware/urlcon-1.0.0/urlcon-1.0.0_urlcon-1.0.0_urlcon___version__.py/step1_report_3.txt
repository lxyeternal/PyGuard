  "purpose": "Define a version string and a safety token, possibly for verifying or authenticating requests or data.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the variable '__safety_token__' containing a base64-encoded string.",
  "sinks": "Potential decoding of the base64 string which could reveal sensitive or malicious data if used improperly.",
  "flows": "The encoded token is stored and may be decoded elsewhere; no explicit decoding or data flow shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded string assigned to a variable named '__safety_token__' suggests an obfuscated or hidden payload. No decoding occurs in this snippet, which raises suspicion about potential use of this token.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'b64decode' but does not use it within this snippet. The '__safety_token__' appears to be base64-encoded data, likely containing some payload or URL. The naming indicates it may be used for security purposes, but its purpose is obscured. No malicious functions, code injection, or suspicious behavior are evident in this small fragment. However, the use of encoded tokens could be part of a covert operation or obfuscation. The code is minimal, and without further context, the intent remains unclear.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to set up a version string and a base64-encoded token, possibly for security or communication purposes. The presence of an encoded string suggests obfuscation or hidden data, but there is no immediate malicious behavior or malicious code present. The snippet is benign but warrants caution if found in a larger context due to potential hidden payloads.",
