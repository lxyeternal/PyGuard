  "purpose": "Constructs and manages URL strings with specified base, protocol, and URL parts.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ method (base, proto), and the __truediv__ method (r).",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method concatenates URL components into a string; no direct sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data from __init__ and __truediv__ methods flow into the string representation in __str__, forming URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The use of process_base could be scrutinized, but it appears to process input safely; the splitter import is external, but usage seems standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a URL builder class with methods to append parts and generate a URL string. The process_base function's behavior is unknown but appears to process input safely. The __truediv__ method allows adding URL parts flexibly. The __str__ method constructs the URL string using provided protocol, base, and parts. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data leaks are evident. No network activity or malicious code injection is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward URL construction utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected based on the provided snippet. It processes input data to build URLs but does not perform any network operations or sensitive data handling that could be exploited.",
