  "conclusion": "The code pattern demonstrates high-risk behavior due to dynamic code execution via `exec()` with untrusted data, especially in a separate thread. While no concrete malicious payload is shown, the pattern itself is dangerous and warrants high caution. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and reflect the potential for malicious activity."
