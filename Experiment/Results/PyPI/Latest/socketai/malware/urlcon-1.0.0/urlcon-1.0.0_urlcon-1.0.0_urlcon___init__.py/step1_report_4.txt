{
  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for a package, specifically exporting the 'Constructor' class or function from the 'constructor' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; there are no operations that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as no external input is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and straightforward, with no unusual or suspicious constructs; it only sets an export list.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'constructor' and explicitly exports 'Constructor' via __all__. It is a common pattern for controlling module exports. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behaviors. The simplicity and lack of external data handling reduce suspicion. No credentials, network operations, or code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely to define which objects are exported from the module.",
