  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the provided evaluations.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .constructor import Constructor\n\n__all__ = (\"Constructor\",)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n\n- The code is straightforward: it imports a class from a local module and exposes it via `__all__`.\n- No data processing, no input/output, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n- The code is minimal and standard for module exports.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing the reports:\n\n**All reports consistently describe the code as a simple module export, with no anomalies, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks.**\n\n- They correctly identify that the code only imports and exposes a class.\n- No report suggests any potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, as expected.\n- Malware scores are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n### Potential flaws or errors in the reports:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly conclude the code is benign.\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are based on the minimal code snippet.\n- The analysis correctly notes the absence of data flows, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Score justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correct given the simplicity.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified by the lack of any security concern.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- The code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**As a security researcher, my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, and the reports are accurate. The scores reflect the true nature of the code. No further action is needed.\n\n---\n\n**Work completed.**",
