  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; simple re-export.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Constructor from a relative module and explicitly exports it via __all__. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve as a module interface definition. No malicious or suspicious code behavior is detected based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module export with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
