  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code imports a class named `Constructor` from a local module `constructor` (or `.constructor`) and exposes it via `__all__`. The code is minimal, straightforward, and performs no data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity.  \n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent.  \n   - No errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   - All reports assign a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - The `securityRisk` scores are also 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n   - The `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   - No report assigns a risk score above 0.5, which is correct. The code is purely structural, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware scores:**  \n   - The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis that there's no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code is a standard module export pattern with no external data handling or dynamic code execution.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward module export pattern with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign and standard.  \n- No adjustments needed to the scores.  \n- The overall risk remains very low, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
