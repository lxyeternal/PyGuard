  "purpose": "To serve as a module that exports the Constructor class imported from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .constructor module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "Import of Constructor from local module; exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Constructor from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It performs no data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior. The code is syntactically correct, simple, and follows standard module export patterns. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity is present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
