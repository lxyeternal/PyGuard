  "purpose": "Export the Constructor class for external use in the module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Constructor from the local constructor module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and defines __all__ for exports. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, or external communications. It appears to be standard Python module boilerplate. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident based solely on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export statement with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions solely to expose the Constructor class.",
