{
  "purpose": "This code exports the Constructor class for use in other modules, facilitating module organization and API exposure.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.constructor'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external effects present.",
  "flows": "The imported Constructor class is exported via __all__, with no data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is minimal and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and explicitly exports it via __all__. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The structure is typical for Python modules designed for API exposure. Since the code is minimal and straightforward, there are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a module export. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues.",
