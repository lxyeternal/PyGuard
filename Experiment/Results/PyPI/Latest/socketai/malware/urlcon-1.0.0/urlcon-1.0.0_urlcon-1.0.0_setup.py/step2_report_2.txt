  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the validity of their conclusions, the scores assigned, and any potential discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms that the code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is static, with no dynamic or external inputs, and no malicious patterns. The embedded usage example is harmless.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature and benign intent. Notes 'maintainer' and 'url' set to 'None' as unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The 'None' values are unconventional but not security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Also confirms benign setup script, with no dynamic code or malicious patterns. Notes 'url' set to 'None' and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious activity, static data, no dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with others, describing a typical setup script with no suspicious patterns. Mentions 'None' fields as unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code, no external data flows, and no security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:** The 'None' values for 'maintainer', 'maintainer_email', and 'url' are unconventional but not harmful. They could be improved for completeness but do not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, benign, and standard for a Python package setup. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
