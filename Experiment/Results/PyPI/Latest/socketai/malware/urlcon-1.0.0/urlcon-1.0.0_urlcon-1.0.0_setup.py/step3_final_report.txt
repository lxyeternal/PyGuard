  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'urlcon' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields, embedded long_description code snippet, dependency list.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data flow present.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data used during package installation; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Fields like 'maintainer', 'maintainer_email', and 'url' are set to the string 'None', which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static configuration data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The embedded long_description contains example code, which is harmless. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The fields with 'None' values are unconventional but not security issues. All signals indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
