  "flows": "CLI command 'pnuske' triggers 'pnuske:run' function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py using setuptools, defining package name, version, packages, and an entry point for CLI. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious code is present. The security concern depends on the implementation of 'pnuske:run', which is not provided. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score should be minimal, around 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the setup script itself. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external 'pnuske' module's implementation. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected within this code.",
