  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'pnuske' with executable entry point",
  "sources": "Setup configuration, specifically the 'setup' function call with package metadata and entry points",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'pnuske:run' when the command line script is invoked",
  "flows": "User runs 'pnuske' command -> invokes 'pnuske:run' function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; usage of standard setup tools",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It specifies package metadata, uses 'find_packages()' to include all sub-packages, and defines a console script entry point. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network activity, data leakage, or hidden code are present. The script is minimal and standard for package distribution, with no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, intended solely for packaging and installation purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
