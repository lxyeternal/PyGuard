{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the 'pnuske' Python package.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions and calls 'find_packages()' to identify package modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The script flows from importing setup functions to defining package metadata and entry points; no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations for a Python package, specifying name, version, packages, and console script entry point. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors is present. Entry point indicates a CLI command 'pnuske' invoking 'pnuske:run', which appears to be a straightforward executable entry. No anomalous or malicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is standard packaging code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and a command-line entry point, typical for Python packages.",
