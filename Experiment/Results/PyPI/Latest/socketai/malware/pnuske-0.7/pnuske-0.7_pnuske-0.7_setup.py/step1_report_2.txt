  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pnuske' Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package information and defines entry points for console scripts.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of the 'pnuske:run' entry point when installed and invoked.",
  "flows": "User executes the 'pnuske' command -> invokes 'pnuske:run' function in the package.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscated elements, and no external data sources or sinks present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' modules to configure package installation. It defines package metadata including name, version, packages, and entry points. The 'entry_points' specify a console command 'pnuske' that executes the 'run' function from the 'pnuske' module. There is nothing suspicious in the code—no malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling detected. It appears to be a standard setup.py configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project without any malicious intent or security concerns. It only defines packaging parameters and a command-line entry point, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
