{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself, which loads a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The imported 'run' function could potentially be a sink if it performs harmful actions when invoked, but the code does not show invocation.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'run' and does not call or execute it within this snippet; no flow from untrusted input to dangerous operations is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only performs a straightforward import with no additional logic or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module, which is standard in Python projects. It does not include any input handling, data processing, or execution logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this minimal snippet. Without further context or invocation, it is impossible to determine if the imported 'run' function is malicious. The snippet alone shows no anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard module import typical in Python projects.",
