  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads an import statement to include a local module component.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or external communication identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with a single import statement; no source-to-sink flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; simply an import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or other actions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The minimal nature limits the scope for malicious intent or vulnerabilities. Without additional context or code, there's no indication of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or security risks detected based on this fragment.",
