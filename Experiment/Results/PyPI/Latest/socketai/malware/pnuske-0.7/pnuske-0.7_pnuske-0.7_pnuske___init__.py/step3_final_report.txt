{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security and malicious potential of a minimal Python import statement, specifically 'from .main import run', within the context of supply chain security analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only in the form of an import statement; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, as the code only imports a function without executing or passing data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code simply imports a function without invocation or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic import statement that does not perform any actions, network communication, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence levels. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent. Given the absence of further context, the code itself poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is a benign, standard Python import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks. The reports accurately assess this, and no adjustments to scores or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
