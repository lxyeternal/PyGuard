  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is just import statements with no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None identified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk is 0, which is reasonable.  \n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; static imports from internal modules are standard and pose no security concern.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Same as above, straightforward import statements.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature. Security risk is 0.1—perhaps slightly cautious but acceptable given the context.  \n- **Justification:** The analysis correctly notes no suspicious activity; the minor security risk score seems to reflect general caution rather than specific findings.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Standard package __init__.py pattern.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, appropriate.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious or obfuscated code is evident. The security risk score is 0, which is justified.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Pure import statements.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, consistent.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Same pattern of benign imports.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, security risk is 0, aligning with the benign assessment.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0 across the board.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward import statements.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature—simple static imports—risk scores should remain very low, ideally close to 0. Some reports assign 0.1, which is acceptable as a cautious default, but a higher score would be unwarranted without evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code snippets are purely structural, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or external interactions.  \n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.  \n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.  \n- No changes are necessary unless future context reveals hidden behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if a cautious default is preferred)  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.",
