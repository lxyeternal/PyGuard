  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, intended to expose various modules and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: ._version, .connection, .runners, .group, .tasks, .executor",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations observed",
  "flows": "Imports are straightforward; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; standard import pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package initialization file that imports classes and functions from local modules to expose a public API. No untrusted data handling, no dynamic execution, and no network activity. The import statements are static and local, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code does not contain any suspicious patterns or risky constructs. Overall, the code is minimal and standard for a Python package's structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package __init__.py file used to expose modules; no malicious behavior, no security risks detected.",
