{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization module that imports internal version info, connection configurations, runners, groups, tasks, and executor classes for a Python package, establishing the package's public API surface.",
  "sources": "Static import statements referencing internal modules and classes; no external data reads or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs static imports without data flow or execution flow beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs; standard import pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules and classes, typical for a package's __init__.py. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not execute dynamic code, handle external input, or perform network operations. The import statements are straightforward, and the code's purpose is to expose internal components. All signals indicate a benign, standard package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static import module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
