  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module import structure for a Python package, organizing various components such as version info, connection configuration, runners, groups, tasks, and executor functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing or output is performed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data transfer occurs within this code snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present in the import statements",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements importing specific classes and variables from internal modules. It does not process input data, execute code dynamically, or perform network or file operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. Since this is a straightforward module import declaration, it doesn't contain actionable security issues or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import structure for a Python package's internal components. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
