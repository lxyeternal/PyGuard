  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is solely import statements, with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Sound; no anomalies or malicious activity are evident.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity detected.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward imports, no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security risk present.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the import-only nature, no external data, and standard structure.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Correct; no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0.1 — very low, possibly considering minimal package exposure, but likely acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard import statements with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Appropriate; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward import structure, typical for package __init__.py.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Sound; no malicious activity or security issues.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, standard import pattern, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** Correct.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — no security risk.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple, static import structure with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No report overstates or underestimates risk or malware potential.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Evaluation:\n\nGiven the nature of the code—pure import statements with no dynamic or external data handling—the overall **malware score** should remain **0**, **obfuscated score** should be **0**, and **risk score** should be **0**.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and confirms the code's benign nature.",
