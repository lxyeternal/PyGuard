  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases related to task execution and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code; it solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no output or data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or unusual code patterns; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code creates custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. These classes are intended for specific error scenarios in a larger application context. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions present. The comments clarify usage but do not introduce any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for logical error handling without any malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase.",
