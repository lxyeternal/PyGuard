  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a set of simple exception class definitions.\n- No data processing, network activity, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n- The comments and structure are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes; no data flow or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above; exception classes only.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar, with emphasis on the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with a comment about potential refactoring; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same straightforward exception classes, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code matches the descriptions. All reports correctly identify that the code is just defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Potential for higher scores?**  \n  No. Given the simplicity and benign nature, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, non-malicious set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's nature.",
