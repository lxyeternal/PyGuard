  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios in a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines classes only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input processing; no execution flow involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with no data handling, external inputs, or dynamic execution. It appears to serve as part of a larger application framework, providing specific exception types for control flow and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is straightforward and lacks any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of an exception handling framework without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
