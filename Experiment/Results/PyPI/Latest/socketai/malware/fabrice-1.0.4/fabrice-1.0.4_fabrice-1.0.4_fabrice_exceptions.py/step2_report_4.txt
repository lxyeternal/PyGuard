  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data processing, network activity, or external interactions are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, with only exception classes and docstrings.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is solely class definitions for exceptions with no embedded logic or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, thorough, and accurate in their assessment.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5?**  \n  None. All scores are zero, aligning with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  Correctly assigned as 0, since no malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions, sticking to observable facts.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Additional insights:\n- The only minor note is a comment about possibly moving code to another module, which is a typical refactoring consideration and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is purely structural, defining exception classes, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
