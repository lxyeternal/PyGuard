  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a larger application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data read).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network, or sensitive operation).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from source to sink).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of comment about potentially moving code to another module, but no malicious or suspicious code or behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions with no logic or data processing. No external inputs, outputs, or code execution pathways are present. The comment suggests possible future refactoring but does not introduce malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of standard application error handling with no suspicious behavior.",
