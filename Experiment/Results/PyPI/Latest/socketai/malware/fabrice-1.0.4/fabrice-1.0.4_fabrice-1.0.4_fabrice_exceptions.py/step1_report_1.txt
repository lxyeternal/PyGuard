  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to task management and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their __init__ methods; no input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are only defining exception structures.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward and contains only exception class definitions. No suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class declarations with no data processing, network activity, or external interactions. The classes serve to encapsulate specific error conditions. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements. No malicious behavior or supply chain security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining custom exceptions for a Python application. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
