  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the associated code carefully.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is solely composed of custom exception class definitions.\n- No data processing, network activity, external interactions, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The comments and structure are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The purpose appears to be to facilitate error handling in a larger application, possibly related to task management or environment validation.\n\n**Security implications:**\n\n- Since the code is purely structural and defensive (exception classes), the security risk is minimal.\n- No malware, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code content.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks are introduced by these class definitions.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no discrepancies are apparent.\n- The comments about moving code or refactoring are benign and do not impact security.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary based on the provided code and reports.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
