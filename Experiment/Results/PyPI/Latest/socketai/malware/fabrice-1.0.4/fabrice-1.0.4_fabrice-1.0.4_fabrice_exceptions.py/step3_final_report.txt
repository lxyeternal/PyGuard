  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and docstrings within the exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three exception class definitions: 'NothingToDo', 'GroupException', and 'InvalidV1Env'. These classes contain minimal logic, serving as error indicators within a larger application. There are no data processing, network calls, or external interactions. The comments suggest potential refactoring but do not imply malicious intent. The code is clear, simple, and standard for error handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward set of exception class definitions with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified.",
