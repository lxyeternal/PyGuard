  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, with conditional logic based on environment variables and filesystem checks.\n- The main security concern highlighted across reports is the use of `exec()` to evaluate `_version.py`.\n- No report indicates network activity, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.75–0.9), reflecting a consensus that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The only potential concern is the use of `exec()` on `_version.py`, which is a common pattern but can be risky if the file is compromised.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or code flaws are evident. The code is straightforward and typical for setup scripts.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** They are generally around 0.2–0.4, reflecting a minor security concern due to `exec()`, but nothing severe.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports note no obfuscation, which is accurate.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** The assumption that `_version.py` is safe is standard; unless the file is tampered with, there's no risk.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Use of `exec()` on `_version.py`:** This is a common pattern to extract version info without importing the module. While it can be risky if the file is malicious, in typical scenarios, it's considered acceptable if the source is trusted.\n- **Environmental and filesystem checks:** These are standard for conditional packaging and pose no security risk.\n- **No external data fetching or code injection:** Confirmed across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The only potential adjustment could be to raise the `securityRisk` slightly if we consider the `exec()` pattern a notable risk, but given the context, 0.2–0.4 is appropriate.\n- Malware scores should remain at 0 unless evidence of malicious code emerges.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on all reports and analysis:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.2–0.3** (moderate concern due to `exec()`, but standard practice)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent. The use of `exec()` is a common pattern but warrants caution. No evidence suggests malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with a minor security concern regarding the use of `exec()` on `_version.py`. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
