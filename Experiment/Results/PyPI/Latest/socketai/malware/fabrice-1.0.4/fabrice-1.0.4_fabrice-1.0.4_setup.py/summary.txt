  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious activity detected. The main concern is the use of exec() on '_version.py', which could pose a security risk if the file is tampered with. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score could be slightly increased to around 0.3-0.4 for caution. Overall, the code is benign, but the exec() pattern warrants caution to prevent potential execution of malicious code if the version file is compromised."
