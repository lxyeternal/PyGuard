      "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but exhibits insecure practices such as hardcoded secrets and environment variable manipulation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.45, reflecting moderate concern primarily due to secret exposure."

      "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious activity detected. The main concern is the use of exec() on '_version.py', which could pose a security risk if the file is tampered with. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score could be slightly increased to around 0.3-0.4 for caution. Overall, the code is benign, but the exec() pattern warrants caution to prevent potential execution of malicious code if the version file is compromised."
