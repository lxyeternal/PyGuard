  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The malware score should be high (~0.7), and the overall risk score should be around 0.75. No obfuscation is detected. Further review of main.py is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
