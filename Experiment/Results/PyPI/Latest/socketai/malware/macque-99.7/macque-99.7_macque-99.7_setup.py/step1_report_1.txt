{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'macque' package, including a custom installation step that executes a function from 'main.py'.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class imports and executes 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function during installation; if 'main.py' contains malicious code, it could perform harmful actions at install time.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main.py', which may contain untrusted or malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code from 'main.py' at install time without any apparent validation or restrictions, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that extends setuptools' install. During installation, it imports and runs 'main()' from a local module 'main.py'. This behavior is a red flag because executing arbitrary code during package installation can be malicious if 'main.py' contains malicious code. There are no indications of obfuscation or hidden behavior, but the act of executing 'main()' at install time without verification is suspicious. The rest of the setup code appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The package's setup script executes code from 'main.py' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. This behavior is suspicious and should be scrutinized further, especially if the content of 'main.py' is unknown or untrusted.",
