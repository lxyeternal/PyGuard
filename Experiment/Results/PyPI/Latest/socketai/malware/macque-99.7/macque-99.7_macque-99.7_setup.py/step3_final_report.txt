{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom install command that executes main() from main.py during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "The run() method in CrazyInstallStrat class, specifically the import and execution of main() from main.py.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() during install could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially executing malicious code if main.py is harmful.",
  "flows": "The setup process calls CrazyInstallStrat.run(), which then imports and executes main(), creating a source-to-sink flow of code execution during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external code (main()) unconditionally during setup without validation; no obfuscation or validation mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The code executes main() from main.py during the installation process without any validation, which is inherently risky. Multiple reports recognize this pattern as suspicious, with malware scores ranging from 0.25 to 0.75. Given the potential for malicious code in main.py, the behavior should be considered high risk. The scores across reports are generally aligned with the severity of executing arbitrary code during setup. No obfuscation is present. The core concern is the supply chain risk posed by executing untrusted code at install time. Therefore, the malware score should be set at approximately 0.7, and the overall security risk at about 0.75, reflecting high suspicion and danger.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The malware score should be high (~0.7), and the overall risk score should be around 0.75. No obfuscation is detected. Further review of main.py is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
