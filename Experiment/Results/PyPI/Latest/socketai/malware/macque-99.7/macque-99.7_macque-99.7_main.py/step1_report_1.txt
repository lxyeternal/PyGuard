  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "platform.node() (hostname), getpass.getuser() (username), os.getcwd() (current directory), random.randint() (random number)",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() (sends data to external URLs)",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, random number) is collected and sent via GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, unencrypted HTTP requests, and collection of user/system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system details such as hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends the collected data via HTTP GET requests. The data sent could be used for tracking, profiling, or malicious surveillance. The URLs are associated with potentially malicious or tracking domains. There is no indication of data being used for legitimate purposes; instead, it appears to leak environment information to external servers. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications or malicious code execution but communicates with untrusted endpoints, which is suspicious in the context of privacy and security.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to collect and transmit system information to potentially malicious or tracking domains, indicating malicious intent or privacy violations. It is recommended to treat this package with suspicion and further investigate the remote endpoints.",
