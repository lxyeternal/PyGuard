      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant supply chain security risk. The malware score should be high (~0.7), and the overall risk score should be around 0.75. No obfuscation is detected. Further review of main.py is recommended to confirm malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive behavior through covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains. While it does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation, its purpose aligns with malicious tracking or reconnaissance activities. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant due to the exfiltration pattern. The scores should reflect these concerns, with a high security risk and malware score around 0.75-0.8, and no obfuscation."
