{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download' for downloading the file, and the environment variable 'LOCALAPPDATA' for the destination path.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file in the local app data directory and executing it with WinExec.",
  "flows": "Download from the URL -> Save to local app data directory -> Execute the downloaded file.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically downloading and executing a file during package installation without user consent or verification. The URL is a generic file transfer site, which is suspicious. The code executes the downloaded file directly after download without any validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during installation, fetches a file from a specified URL and saves it as 'Driver.exe' in the local app data directory. It then executes this file immediately. The use of 'ctypes.windll.kernel32.WinExec' to run the downloaded file suggests malicious intent, such as installing malware or backdoors. The URL is external and untrusted, and the code lacks any validation or checksums. This behavior aligns with malware characteristics, such as unauthorized download and execution of external code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external file during installation without user consent, indicating high potential for malicious intent. The use of standard setup tools masks the malicious activity, but the actions are suspicious and dangerous.",
