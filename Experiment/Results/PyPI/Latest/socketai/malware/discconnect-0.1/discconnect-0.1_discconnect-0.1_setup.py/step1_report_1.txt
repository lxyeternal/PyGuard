  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute a file from a specified URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://filetransfer.io/data-package/MG85ggQt/download' and the environment variable 'LOCALAPPDATA' for saving the file.",
  "sinks": "Writing to a file ('Driver.exe') in the local app data directory and executing it via WinExec.",
  "flows": "Request data from the URL -> Save response content to a file -> Execute the saved file.",
  "anomalies": "Automatically downloading and executing an external file during installation without validation or user consent, hardcoded URL, use of WinExec which is unsafe.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to perform additional actions post-installation. It fetches an external executable from a hardcoded URL and executes it using WinExec. The use of environment variables to determine save location and immediate execution of downloaded content suggests malicious intent or a supply chain attack vector. No input validation or checksum verification is present. The code operates silently, which is suspicious. The overall behavior indicates potential malicious activity as it downloads and runs an external binary during setup without user approval.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external file during package installation, which could be used to install malware or backdoors. The hardcoded URL and automatic execution are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
