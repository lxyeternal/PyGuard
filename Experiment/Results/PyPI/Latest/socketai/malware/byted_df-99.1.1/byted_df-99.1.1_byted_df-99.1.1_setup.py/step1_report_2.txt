  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the Python package 'byted-df', including metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "N/A (setup configuration; no input reading involved).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious package or entry point names, and no unusual code structures. The package version '99.1.1' is unconventional but not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, finds packages automatically, and sets up a console script entry point. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling. The script does not include any dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data exposure. The presence of a high version number ('99.1.1') is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected. It appears to be a benign configuration for packaging a Python project.",
