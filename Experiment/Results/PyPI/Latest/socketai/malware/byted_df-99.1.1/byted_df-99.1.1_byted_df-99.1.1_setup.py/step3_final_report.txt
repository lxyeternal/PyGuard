{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, package inclusion, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields, find_packages(), entry_points for console_scripts",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or code execution points within the setup script itself",
  "flows": "Registration of CLI command; no data flow or code execution beyond package registration",
  "anomalies": "High version number ('99.1.1') is unusual but not suspicious; no obfuscation or secrets present",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration using setuptools, with no dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation. The entry point references a function in the 'byted_df' module, which could execute code when invoked, but the setup script itself only registers this command without executing it. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script. The malware score is appropriately zero, as no malicious code is present. The security risk score is minimal (around 0.1) due to potential runtime execution, but this is outside the scope of the setup script itself. The high version number is unconventional but not malicious. Overall, the code poses negligible supply chain risk based solely on this setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code. The potential for malicious activity depends on the implementation of the 'byted_df' module, which is not provided. The current assessment assigns malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score, reflecting the benign nature of the script.",
