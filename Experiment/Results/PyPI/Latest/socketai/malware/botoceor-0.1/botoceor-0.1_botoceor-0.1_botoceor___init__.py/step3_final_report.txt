  "purpose": "A minimal Python script that outputs a static message for testing or confirmation purposes.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static code with no data reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only prints to standard output without external communication or data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code executes a simple print statement with no data transfer or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple print statement, confirmed by multiple reviews as benign and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. It contains no data inputs, external communications, or complex logic. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting its harmless nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0), given the simplicity and consensus of the reviews.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, posing no security threat or malicious intent. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
