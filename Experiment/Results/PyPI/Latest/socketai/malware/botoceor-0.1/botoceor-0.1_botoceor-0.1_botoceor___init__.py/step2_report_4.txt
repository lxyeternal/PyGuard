  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward `print(\"It Works\")` statement.\n   - No inputs, data flows, external communication, or complex logic are present.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code is benign; all reports agree on its harmless nature.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n   - The code's simplicity makes it unlikely to contain hidden malicious intent.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0 or 0.0, correctly indicating no malware.\n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Errors or Flaws in Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n   - No logical flaws or assumptions that could be challenged.\n\n5. **Score Justification & Recommendations**:\n   - The **malware score** of 0 is appropriate; there's no malicious activity.\n   - The **obfuscated score** of 0 is correct; the code is straightforward.\n   - The **security risk score** of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities are present.\n   - The **confidence** scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n6. **Overall Risk Assessment**:\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, the overall risk is negligible.\n   - No changes needed in scoring.\n\n**Final Estimation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a trivial print statement with no malicious or obfuscated elements, posing no security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
