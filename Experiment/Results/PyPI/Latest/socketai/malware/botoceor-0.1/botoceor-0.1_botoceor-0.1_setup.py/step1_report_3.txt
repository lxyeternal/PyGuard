  "purpose": "Modify file contents and potentially write to specific system paths during installation, possibly for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'passwrd' file in the current directory.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '/<system>/<u>/<p>' paths, which could be system directories, and writing obfuscated data to the file.",
  "flows": "Reading 'passwrd' file -> decoding or processing data -> writing to system path '/<system>/<u>/<p>'",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated string decoding, hardcoded file path 'passwrd', dynamic path construction based on file contents, attempts to write to system directories without clear legitimate reason.",
  "analysis": "The script subclasses the install command to perform additional actions during package installation. It contains an obfuscated string 'l' that is decoded into a presumably malicious payload or script. It reads from a local 'passwrd' file, splits lines, and if a line contains a specific token ('1000'), it attempts to write decoded data into system directories '/<system>/<user>/<project>'. This behavior is suspicious as it involves writing to system paths, potentially with malicious intent. The code is intentionally obfuscated, with decoding mechanisms and dynamic path creation, indicating malicious obfuscation. The try-except block suppresses errors, which might hide malicious activity or errors.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscated behavior, attempts to write to system directories based on file content, and performs actions during installation that could compromise system integrity. These are strong indicators of malicious intent, likely aiming to modify or inject malicious code during package installation.",
