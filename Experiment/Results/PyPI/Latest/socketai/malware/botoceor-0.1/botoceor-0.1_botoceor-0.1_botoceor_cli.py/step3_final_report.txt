  "purpose": "To assess the supply chain security of the provided Python code snippet for malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or environment variables; it solely defines a function that prints a static message.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement within a function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple function 'cli()' that prints 'It Works'. It contains no external inputs, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with full confidence (1.0), which is appropriate given the code's simplicity. No logical flaws or potential vulnerabilities are evident. The code's behavior aligns with a benign utility function, and the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current evaluations and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
