  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and could facilitate malicious activity if 'main()' is malicious. The scores are justified and consistent with the behavior, indicating a moderate to high security concern. Further inspection of 'main.py' is advised before trusting or deploying this package."
