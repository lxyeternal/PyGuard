{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation command that, after executing the standard install process, imports and runs the 'main()' function from the 'main' module during package installation.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' and the call to 'main()' within the 'run()' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during installation, which can run arbitrary code in the context of the setup process.",
  "flows": "The setup process calls 'install.run()', which then imports 'main' and executes 'main()' during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code ('main()') during package installation, which is unconventional and potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that executes 'main()' from 'main' during setup, which could be exploited if 'main()' contains malicious code. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The pattern of executing code during setup is suspicious and poses a security risk. The scores assigned in the reports reflect moderate suspicion, with malware scores around 0.4-0.5 and security risk scores around 0.6, which are appropriate given the potential for malicious activity. The overall behavior warrants caution, and further review of 'main.py' is recommended to determine malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and could facilitate malicious activity if 'main()' is malicious. The scores are justified and consistent with the behavior, indicating a moderate to high security concern. Further inspection of 'main.py' is advised before trusting or deploying this package.",
