{
  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number for each request.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs with query parameters including system info and a random number.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory) and a random number are embedded into URLs and sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs appear suspicious and are not associated with legitimate services; the code sends system data to potentially malicious domains without user consent. The use of random numbers in URL paths may be for tracking or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers basic system information and constructs URLs targeting external domains. It then performs HTTP GET requests to these URLs, sending system info parameters. The domains are suspicious and not recognizable as legitimate services. The code runs in the main block, executing upon module execution. No other malicious activities (such as code injection, backdoors, or credential theft) are evident. The pattern of data collection and outbound requests indicates potentially malicious intent, likely for tracking or exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This script collects system information and transmits it to external, suspicious domains, which could be part of a malicious tracking or data exfiltration scheme. The URLs are suspicious, and the data transmission occurs without any apparent user interaction or consent.",
