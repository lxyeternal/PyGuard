  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain patterns, no user consent, or visible purpose besides info gathering. No user input handling or validation. Hardcoded URLs, potentially malicious. No error handling beyond logging.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains. It sends this data via HTTP GET requests without encryption or user consent, which could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The use of obfuscated or malicious domains suggests potentially malicious intent. No malicious payload or backdoor code found, but the data collection and transmission pattern is suspicious. No signs of code obfuscation, but the external URLs indicate possible malicious tracking or spying activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be collecting system information and transmitting it to untrusted external URLs, potentially for malicious purposes such as tracking or data theft. No malicious code or backdoors are directly evident, but the behavior aligns with suspicious data exfiltration. The overall risk is moderate, warranting caution.",
