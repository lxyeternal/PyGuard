      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and could facilitate malicious activity if 'main()' is malicious. The scores are justified and consistent with the behavior, indicating a moderate to high security concern. Further inspection of 'main.py' is advised before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior consistent with data exfiltration or malicious tracking, communicating with untrusted domains without user consent. While no active malicious payloads are present, the pattern of external data transmission is concerning. The malware score should be around 0.7, and the security risk score around 0.8, reflecting high suspicion and potential threat. The assessments in the provided reports are generally accurate and align with this analysis."
