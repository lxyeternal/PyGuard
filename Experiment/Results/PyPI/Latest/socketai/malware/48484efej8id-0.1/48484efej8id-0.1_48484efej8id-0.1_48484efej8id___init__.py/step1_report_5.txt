  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with decoded data; the base64 string decodes to a print statement, which is benign, but the pattern indicates potential for malicious code obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module, decodes a base64 string which translates to 'print(\"test\")', and executes it via exec(). While the decoded code itself is harmless and only prints 'test', the pattern of decoding and executing dynamically is commonly used to conceal malicious intent. This approach can hide malicious payloads from straightforward static analysis. The code itself does not contain any hardcoded credentials or malicious commands, but the structure is suspicious because it allows execution of arbitrary code embedded in base64 strings.",
  "conclusion": "This code pattern is potentially malicious due to its use of dynamic decoding and execution, which can hide malicious payloads. Currently, the payload is benign, but the pattern itself warrants caution. It is a common obfuscation method used in malicious scripts.",
