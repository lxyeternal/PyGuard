  "purpose": "Decodes a base64-encoded string and executes the resulting code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' is the source of data; it is a hardcoded string within the code.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded string, which is a potential sink for malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode('cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==') -> decode('utf-8') -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding combined with exec() to run hidden code; no comments or context provided; obfuscated approach indicates suspicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string which translates to 'print(\"test\")', and then executes this code. While the decoded code itself is benign ('print(\"test\")'), the pattern of decoding and executing base64-encoded content is often used to hide malicious payloads. The code does not contain any other logic, input handling, or external dependencies. Given the pattern, the main concern is the potential for malicious payloads disguised via base64 encoding. The decoded payload here is harmless, but the technique used is commonly associated with obfuscation in malicious scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation via base64 encoding combined with exec() to execute hidden code, which is a common malicious technique. While the current decoded payload is harmless, the pattern itself is suspicious and could be used to execute malicious code if modified.",
