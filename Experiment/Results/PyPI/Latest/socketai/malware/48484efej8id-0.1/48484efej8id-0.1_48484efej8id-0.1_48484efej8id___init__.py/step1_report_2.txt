{
  "purpose": "Decodes a base64-encoded string and executes the resulting code.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' which, when decoded, is the string 'print(\"test\")'.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function, which executes the decoded code, potentially running arbitrary Python code.",
  "flows": "The base64 string is decoded to 'print(\"test\")', then passed directly to exec(), executing the print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() indicates obfuscation and potential malicious intent to hide code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code first imports the base64 module. It then decodes a base64 string, which decodes to a simple print statement 'print(\"test\")'. The decoded string is passed to exec(), which executes it. Although the current decoded code just prints 'test', the use of base64 and exec() suggests an intent to hide or obfuscate malicious code, as this pattern is common in malicious scripts to conceal their true behavior. There are no other suspicious operations or data flows present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation techniques using base64 decoding and exec(), which is a common pattern for malicious scripts to hide their true intent. Although the current payload is harmless, the structure indicates potential for executing malicious code. Therefore, it should be considered suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
