{
  "purpose": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it, which is a pattern often associated with obfuscation and potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The base64 string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' is decoded to 'print(\"test\")', which is then executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded string, which could be manipulated to run malicious code if the base64 input is externally controlled.",
  "flows": "Input: base64 string -> decoding -> exec() on decoded string -> execution of 'print(\"test\")'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding combined with exec() is highly obfuscated and often used to hide malicious payloads; the pattern is inherently suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a common obfuscation technique by decoding a base64 string and executing it dynamically. The decoded payload is benign ('print(\"test\")'), indicating no malicious activity in this instance. However, the pattern itself is dangerous because it can conceal malicious code, and if the base64 input is externally supplied or manipulated, it could lead to arbitrary code execution. The pattern's high obfuscation score (around 0.8-0.9) is justified, and the malware score should reflect the potential risk rather than the current benign payload. The overall security risk is moderate to high due to the pattern's potential misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of decoding and executing arbitrary code is inherently risky and often used in malicious scripts. Although the current payload is benign, the pattern warrants high caution. The scores should reflect the pattern's potential for malicious use, with a low malware score (~0.2-0.3) considering the benign payload, but high obfuscation and risk scores due to the technique's dangerous nature.",
