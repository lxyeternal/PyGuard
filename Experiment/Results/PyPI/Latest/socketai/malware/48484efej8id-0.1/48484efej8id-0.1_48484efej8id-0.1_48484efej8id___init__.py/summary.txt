  "conclusion": "The code pattern of decoding and executing arbitrary code is inherently risky and often used in malicious scripts. Although the current payload is benign, the pattern warrants high caution. The scores should reflect the pattern's potential for malicious use, with a low malware score (~0.2-0.3) considering the benign payload, but high obfuscation and risk scores due to the technique's dangerous nature."
