  "flows": "base64 decoding -> exec() executes the decoded string 'print(\"test\")'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on dynamically decoded data is suspicious; the base64 string decodes to a simple print statement, but the pattern is often used to hide malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the base64 module, decodes a base64 string, and executes the decoded result. The decoded string is 'print(\"test\")', which is benign. However, the pattern of decoding and executing arbitrary code is a common technique for obfuscation and potential malicious behavior. The code itself does not perform malicious actions directly, but the method used is risky and can be exploited to run malicious payloads if the base64 string were altered.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation via base64 decoding and dynamic execution, which is a common technique for hiding malicious payloads. While the current payload is benign, the pattern is inherently risky and could be used maliciously. It warrants caution and further review if encountered in a real environment.",
