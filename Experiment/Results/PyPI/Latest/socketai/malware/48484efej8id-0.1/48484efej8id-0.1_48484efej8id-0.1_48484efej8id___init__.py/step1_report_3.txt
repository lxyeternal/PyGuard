  "purpose": "Decode and execute a base64-encoded string, likely for dynamic code execution.",
  "sources": "The base64-encoded string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' is a data source, which when decoded, reveals code to be executed.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded string, which could be malicious if the decoded content is harmful.",
  "flows": "base64.b64decode('cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==') -> decode('utf-8') -> exec()",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding followed immediately by exec() is suspicious, as it masks the actual code, a common obfuscation technique.",
  "analysis": "The code decodes a base64 string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' which translates to 'print(\"test\")'. This decoded string is then executed via exec(). Since the decoded string is benign ('print(\"test\")'), the code is not malicious. However, the pattern of decoding and executing code dynamically is often used to hide malicious intent. If the decoded string were malicious, this pattern could be dangerous. In this case, the actual decoded content is benign, but the structure remains suspicious and potentially malicious if altered.",
  "conclusion": "The code decodes and executes a base64-encoded string. Currently, the decoded string is benign ('print(\"test\")'), so it does not appear malicious. Nonetheless, the use of dynamic decoding and execution is inherently risky and could be exploited to run malicious code. It warrants caution, especially if the base64 string could be externally supplied.",
