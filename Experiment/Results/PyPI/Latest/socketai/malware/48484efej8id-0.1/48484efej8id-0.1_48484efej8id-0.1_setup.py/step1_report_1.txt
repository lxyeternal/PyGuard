The encoded string is 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==', which decodes to 'print(\"test\")'. Thus, the code will print 'test' during the post-install process, indicating no malicious payload in this snippet. However, the pattern of decoding and executing code dynamically is commonly used to conceal malicious code, and should be considered suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or other anomalies are present beyond this obfuscation tactic. The use of this pattern warrants caution, but based solely on the current payload, no malicious behavior is confirmed.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code employs obfuscation techniques (base64 and exec), which is suspicious. The decoded content is harmless ('print(\\\"test\\\")'), but the pattern could be used maliciously. Overall, no malicious payload is present in this snippet, but the approach is suspicious and should be reviewed further if more payload details are revealed.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.8,\n  \"malware\": 0.2,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.3\n}",
