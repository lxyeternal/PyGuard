The package name is a string of random characters, which could be suspicious or obfuscated.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package named '48484efej8id'. It includes a function run_after_install() that prints a message, decodes a base64-encoded string, and executes it via exec(). The encoded string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==' decodes to 'print(\"test\")', which simply prints 'test' to stdout. The execution of this string is done within the post-install hook, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution if the encoded string is malicious. The use of base64 encoding and exec() in such a context can be a technique to conceal malicious code, though in this instance, it appears benign as the decoded content is just a print statement. However, the pattern is suspicious and warrants caution, especially if the encoded content were to change or if the package was maliciously crafted. Overall, the code demonstrates obfuscation tactics common in malicious packages but appears to currently execute benign code.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code contains obfuscation techniques using base64 encoding and exec(), which can be used maliciously to hide harmful code. Currently, it executes a benign print statement, but the pattern is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. The package setup and post-install script behavior pose a potential security risk.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.7,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.7,\n  \"malware\": 0.2,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.4\n}",
