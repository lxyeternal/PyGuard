  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package with a post-install script.",
  "sources": "The function run_after_install() which is called via entry point post_install_script.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function which executes decoded base64 content, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run_after_install() function is invoked, decoding base64 content and executing it.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64-encoded payload executed via exec(), which is suspicious and often used to obfuscate malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a package named '48484efej8id'. It includes a post-install script function 'run_after_install' that prints a message and decodes a base64 string 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==', which decodes to 'print(\"test\")', then executes it. While the decoded payload appears benign ('print(\"test\")'), the use of base64 decoding combined with exec() in post-install scripts is a common obfuscation technique that can hide malicious payloads. This pattern warrants caution as it can be exploited for executing arbitrary malicious code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains a post-install hook that decodes and executes base64-encoded code, which is a suspicious pattern often associated with malicious intent. Although the current payload is benign, the method used is typical of malicious packages that hide harmful behavior. Therefore, this package should be considered suspicious and potentially malicious until further inspection of the decoded payload.",
