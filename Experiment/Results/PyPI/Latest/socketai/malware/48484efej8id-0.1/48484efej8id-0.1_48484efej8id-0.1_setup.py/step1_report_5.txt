  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for a Python package that registers a post-install hook.",
  "sources": "The function run_after_install() is defined, which contains embedded encoded content; it is referenced in entry_points for post-install execution.",
  "sinks": "The run_after_install() function executes base64-decoded code dynamically, which could potentially run malicious code if the decoded content is harmful.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the entry point 'post_install_script' triggers run_after_install(), which decodes and executes embedded code, potentially executing malicious payload.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed dynamically; this obfuscates the actual payload and is suspicious. The payload is hidden via encoding and dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a post-install hook that runs the function run_after_install(). This function prints a message and then decodes a base64-encoded string, executing its content dynamically via exec(). The encoded string is 'cHJpbnQoInRlc3QiKQ==', which decodes to 'print(\"test\")'. This suggests benign behavior. However, the pattern of decoding and executing code at runtime is often used to hide malicious payloads. Since the decoded content is just a print statement, the current payload appears harmless. Nonetheless, the obfuscation pattern warrants caution, as in a real scenario, the payload could be malicious. The package’s name and the dynamic code execution are suspicious and could be used to embed malicious behavior hidden behind encoded strings.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation by encoding executable content, which could be malicious if the payload were harmful. Currently, the embedded payload is harmless, but the pattern is suspicious. The use of dynamic execution during installation is a security risk and warrants further scrutiny before deployment.",
