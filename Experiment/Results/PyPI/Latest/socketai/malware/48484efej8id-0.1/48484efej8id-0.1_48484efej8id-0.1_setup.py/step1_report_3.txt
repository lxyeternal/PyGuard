  "purpose": "Define a Python package with a post-installation script that executes upon installation.",
  "sources": "The function run_after_install() which executes after install, reads an encoded string, decodes it, and executes the decoded code.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing decoded base64 content, which could run arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "run_after_install() is called during post-install, executing code decoded from base64, which could perform malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding and exec() to run decoded code, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The encoded string is short and generic, hiding the actual payload.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with setuptools. It defines a function run_after_install() that prints a message, decodes a base64 string, and executes it. The setup() call registers this function as a post-install script via entry_points. The use of base64 encoding combined with exec() is a common obfuscation technique to hide malicious code. The payload, once decoded, could perform arbitrary actions, including malicious behavior. The code appears intentionally designed to execute hidden code during installation, which is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated, potentially malicious behavior by executing code decoded from base64 during post-install. This pattern is often used to hide malicious actions. Due to the use of exec() on encoded content, this package could execute arbitrary code and pose security risks.",
