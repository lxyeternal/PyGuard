{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'envvenuma', intended to get and send environment variables.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; standard setup configuration without external data reading besides the README file during packaging.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code only specifies package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup process primarily reads a README file for description.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads 'README.md' for the long description, which is common practice. No code execution, data handling, or network communication occurs within this snippet. The package description suggests it interacts with environment variables, but no such operations are present here. The code appears to be a straightforward setup configuration for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks in this setup script. It is a standard package configuration with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
