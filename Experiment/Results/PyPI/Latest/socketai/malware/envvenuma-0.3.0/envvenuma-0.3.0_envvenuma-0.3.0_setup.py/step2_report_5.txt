  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The only external file read is \"README.md\" for the long description, which is typical.\n- The 'requests' dependency is specified but not used within this script, which is common in setup files.\n- No data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- The security risk is also 0, as expected.\n\n**Potential issues or points of contention:**\n- The 'install_requires' includes 'requests' but does not use it. While this is not malicious, it might be worth noting as unnecessary, but it doesn't impact security.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior or code that could be exploited.\n\n**Score justification:**\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear.\n- The overall risk score should be 0, given the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a standard setup script with no security issues.\n- No modifications needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis package setup script is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
