  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'envvenuma' Python package, designed to facilitate getting and sending environment variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this script; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads from the filesystem ('README.md') during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It reads a description file and specifies dependencies, packages, and metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is involved. The 'requests' dependency is specified but not used within this script, which is typical for setup files. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies. The package appears safe to use.",
