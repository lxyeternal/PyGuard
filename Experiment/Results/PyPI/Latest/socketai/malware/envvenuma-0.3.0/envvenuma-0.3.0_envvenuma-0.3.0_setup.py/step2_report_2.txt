  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The only noteworthy operation is reading \"README.md\" for the long description, which is typical.\n- The dependency on 'requests' is declared but not used within the setup script, which is common and not suspicious.\n- No external data sources, user input, network activity, or code execution beyond package configuration.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original code snippet provided. All reports correctly identify that there are no anomalies or malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware and obfuscation scores:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk scores:** All reports assign securityRisk=0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n- **Confidence levels:** All reports have high confidence (1), which is justified.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, with no contradictions or suspicious claims.\n- The only minor point is the 'requests' dependency being declared but unused; however, this is typical in setup files and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- **Malware:** Should remain at 0, as there's no indication of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Remains at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n- Based on all evidence, the setup script is standard, safe, and free of security issues.\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical setup script with no security concerns. All scores should be zero, reflecting its benign nature.",
