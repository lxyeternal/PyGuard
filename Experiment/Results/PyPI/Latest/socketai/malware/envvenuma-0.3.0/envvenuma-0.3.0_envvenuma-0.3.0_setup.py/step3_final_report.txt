  "purpose": "A setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading the README for description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, user input, or network activity. It reads a README file and specifies dependencies, including 'requests', which is unused here but not suspicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The dependency on 'requests' is unnecessary but not malicious. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
