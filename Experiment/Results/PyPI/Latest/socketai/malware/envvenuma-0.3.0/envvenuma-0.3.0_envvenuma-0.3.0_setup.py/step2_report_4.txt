  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- It reads the README.md for the long description.\n- It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.\n- No dynamic code, user input, or network activity.\n- The 'install_requires' includes 'requests' but the package code itself is not shown here, so no malicious use is evident.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or embedded malicious logic are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n**However,** since all reports are unanimous and accurate, I agree with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The 'requests' dependency is included but not used in this script. While this isn't a security issue, it might be unnecessary. But it doesn't impact security or malware risk.\n- No suspicious code or logic is present, so no change in scores is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert judgment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are thorough and correct. The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical setup script with no security risks.\n- All scores are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe package setup code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The reports accurately reflect this.",
