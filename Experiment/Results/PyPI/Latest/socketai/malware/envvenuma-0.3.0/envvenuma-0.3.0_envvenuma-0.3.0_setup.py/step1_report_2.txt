{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the packaging setup for the 'envvenuma' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "None, as the code is a static setup script with no input or data reading beyond reading the README.md file.",
  "sinks": "None, the setup script does not perform actions that could lead to data leaks or untrusted data manipulation during execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, since there are no source-to-sink data flows involved in the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The script uses standard setup functions and common patterns. Reading README.md for long_description is typical; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. It specifies package name, version, author, description, URL, package discovery, classifiers, required Python version, and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or external data processing occurs during execution. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and does not contain any malicious behavior or security concerns. It only configures package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted or harmful code.",
