      "conclusion": "The analyzed code exhibits highly suspicious, potentially malicious behavior by decrypting and executing code during installation on Windows. The use of hardcoded cryptographic material and dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious intent, aligning with the high scores and assessments in the reports. The package should be flagged as malicious or at least highly suspicious to prevent supply chain compromise."
