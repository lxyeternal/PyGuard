{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'wev3' with custom installation behavior that decrypts and executes code on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, uses hardcoded strings for decryption, and imports data from external modules ('requests' and 'fernet').",
  "sinks": "Execution of decrypted code via exec(), import of potentially malicious modules, and network requests (via 'requests') in the custom install class.",
  "flows": "The setup script calls the custom install run() method, which on Windows imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then executes decrypted code via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time; the decryption and execution within a custom install command are suspicious and can be used to run malicious code. The long description appears random, possibly obfuscation. The import of 'requests' and 'fernet' only on Windows hints at platform-specific malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py file that defines package metadata and a custom installation command. The custom install class 'QobxClwNwoWnNIsWGPGVJyUiaGMzruuUjnirOmDYGlBUbFXMQYZoausExnxFYiHjwzfOViHsSBrjLgKTSEaapSTYhYaCjEOo' overrides the run() method. When run on Windows ('nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then decrypts a hardcoded ciphertext with a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes the resulting code via exec(). This behavior can be malicious, as it allows execution of arbitrary code hidden behind the encrypted payload, potentially downloading or executing malicious scripts at install time. The use of encrypted code and dynamic execution is highly suspicious and indicates possible malicious intent or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior: it decrypts and executes code at install time using hardcoded cryptographic material, which could be used to run malicious payloads on Windows systems. This is a significant security concern and suggests the package could be used to compromise systems during installation.",
