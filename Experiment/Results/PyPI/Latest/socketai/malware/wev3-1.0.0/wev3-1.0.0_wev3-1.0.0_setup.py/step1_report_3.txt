{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'wev3' and includes a custom installation class that executes decrypted code during installation on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment information (os.name), imports modules ('os', 'requests', 'fernet'), and decrypts and executes a Fernet-encrypted string during installation.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decrypted code, which may lead to arbitrary code execution. The decrypted payload could perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Environment check (os.name) → Import modules → Decrypt payload → execute payload via exec() during installation on Windows",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hardcoded Fernet key and encrypted payload that is decrypted and executed at install time. The payload is concealed and could perform malicious actions. The use of exec() with decrypted content is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package but contains a hidden malicious component. During installation on Windows systems, it decrypts a payload and executes it, which could be malicious. The decryption key and payload are embedded in the code, indicating obfuscation. The use of exec() on decrypted data poses a significant security risk. There is no indication that the code performs any legitimate or safe action with the decrypted content. The setup process is thus compromised with potentially malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload that executes during package installation on Windows. The use of encrypted payload, hardcoded key, and exec() strongly suggest malicious intent. The package should be considered unsafe and should not be used.",
