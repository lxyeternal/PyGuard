{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process with a custom install step that reports system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()).",
  "sinks": "Sends system information via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (https://burpcollaborator.net).",
  "flows": "During installation, the code collects system data and transmits it directly to a remote server without validation or user consent.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes sending system information (hostname, cwd, username) to an external server during package installation, which is not standard practice. No user prompt or opt-in mechanism is present. The URL used is a known testing/burpcollaborator domain, indicating potential malicious or testing behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup process by defining a CustomInstall class that overrides the run() method. This method gathers system information—hostname, current directory, and username—and immediately sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior is suspicious because it occurs automatically during package installation without user awareness or consent, potentially for tracking or data exfiltration purposes. The URL used is associated with security testing tools, which raises concerns about malicious intent or testing. No other malicious code, such as reverse shells, file manipulation, or data theft, is present. However, the covert data transmission during package installation is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious-like behavior by collecting and exfiltrating system information during package installation without user consent. This is highly suspicious and could be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or data theft. The presence of this behavior in a package is a security risk and warrants caution.",
