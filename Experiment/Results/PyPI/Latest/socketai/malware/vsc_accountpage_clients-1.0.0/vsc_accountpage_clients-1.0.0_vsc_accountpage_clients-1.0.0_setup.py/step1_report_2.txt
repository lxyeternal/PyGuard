{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() during the run method in CustomInstall class",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to a remote URL with system info as parameters",
  "flows": "Data collected from hostname, current working directory, and username flows from sources in run() to the requests.get() sink",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without user consent, sending system information to an external server during installation. The URL used is a suspicious domain ('burpcollaborator.net'), commonly associated with security testing but used here in a potentially malicious manner. No input validation or user notification is present.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package setup. The CustomInstall class overrides the run() method to execute the standard install process, then gathers hostname, current directory, and username. Immediately after, it makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server, passing the collected data as parameters. This behavior indicates potential malicious intent to exfiltrate user data upon package installation, which is a security concern. The domain used is known in security testing contexts but is suspicious in this context, especially since there is no user notification or consent. No other malicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear case of malicious data exfiltration during package installation. It collects system information and sends it to an external server without user consent, constituting a security risk. The use of a domain associated with security testing tools may be intentional for malicious purposes or a placeholder, but regardless, it is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
