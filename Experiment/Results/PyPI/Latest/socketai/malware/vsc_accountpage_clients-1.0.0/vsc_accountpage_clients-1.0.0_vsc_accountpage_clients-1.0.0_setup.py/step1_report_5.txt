{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation step to collect system information and send it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() during the custom install run.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends collected data (hostname, current working directory, username) to an external URL, which could be used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() flows into the requests.get() request, transmitting system information to an external domain during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes an unusual behavior: collecting and transmitting system data automatically during package install without user consent or explicit notice. The URL used (burpcollaborator.net) suggests potential for command-and-control or monitoring. The comment indicates it may be a placeholder for other domains, but in its current form, it acts maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the setup process by overriding the run method of the install command to collect hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain. This behavior is unusual and potentially malicious, as it leaks system information without user awareness or consent. No other malicious code such as system modification, backdoors, or persistent malware is present. The external communication could be used for tracking or malicious monitoring. The code does not appear to be obfuscated and is straightforward, but the automatic data exfiltration during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a malicious action by exfiltrating system information during package installation. It appears to be designed for tracking or malicious monitoring purposes. This behavior is suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
