{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The data is read from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() during the run() method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends the collected data to https://burpcollaborator.net, transmitting potentially sensitive system information over the network.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from hostname, cwd, and username variables and then transmitted via requests.get() to the external URL during the run() method execution in the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs automatic, covert data exfiltration during package installation without user notification or consent; the URL used is associated with security testing tools, indicating suspicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the run() method to collect system info and send it externally. This behavior is unusual for standard package setup scripts and suggests covert data collection. The data flow from system info sources to network sink is straightforward but malicious in intent. The code is not obfuscated, and no malicious payloads like reverse shells are present. The exfiltration occurs silently during install, raising privacy and security concerns. Given the behavior, the malware score should be high, around 0.8, reflecting malicious intent, and the security risk score should also be high, around 0.8, due to privacy violation and potential data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior with high security and privacy risks. The current scores underestimate the severity; they should be adjusted upward to reflect the malicious intent and potential harm.",
