  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that collects and transmits system information during installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with external URL and parameters",
  "flows": "source data (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() to external server",
  "anomalies": "The code transmits system hostname, current directory, and username to an external URL during installation without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and other modules, defines a custom installation class that extends the standard install. During run(), it gathers system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (https://burpcollaborator.net). This behavior is embedded within the installation process, which can be considered malicious if done without user awareness or consent. The request to an external server with potentially sensitive information constitutes a privacy concern. The code does not perform any other malicious actions such as damaging files, mining, or reverse shells. The external URL is a placeholder for a command-and-control or data exfiltration server, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects system information during package installation and transmits it to an external server, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The primary concern is privacy violation and unauthorized data exfiltration.",
