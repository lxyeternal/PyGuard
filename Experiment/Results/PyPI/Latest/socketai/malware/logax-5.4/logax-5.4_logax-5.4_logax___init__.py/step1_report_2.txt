{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from local modules 'file' and 'i', likely for internal use within a package.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.file' and '.i' modules, which could contain any code or data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; however, imported modules might contain functions or data that could be used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Imports could allow execution of code or data from these modules, but no explicit flow is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') is generally discouraged as it obscures imported entities and can lead to namespace pollution; no malicious code detected here explicitly.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two import statements with wildcard syntax, importing everything from local modules. This pattern is common but can hide malicious behavior if the imported modules are malicious; however, there is no indication of malicious activity in these lines alone. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are evident. Since the modules themselves are not provided, no further analysis can be performed on their content.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, there is no direct malicious behavior. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution as it can conceal malicious code within the imported modules. Without additional context or content from 'file' and 'i', the security risk appears low.",
