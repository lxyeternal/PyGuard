{
  "purpose": "The code performs relative wildcard imports from local modules 'file' and 'i', likely to include all symbols from these modules into the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The import statements from .file and .i modules, which are the source of imported symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs; the code does not process or output data, so no untrusted data flow is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this minimal snippet; the code only imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports, which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious or unintended code; no obfuscation or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only relative wildcard import statements, which are discouraged due to maintainability and security concerns. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leakage is observable. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are appropriate given the minimal context. Wildcard imports can hide malicious code if the modules are compromised, but there is no evidence of such here. The confidence scores reflect the limited context but are reasonable. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be replaced with explicit imports for clarity and security, but this does not constitute an immediate threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, containing only import statements with wildcard syntax. The risk is low, and the scores assigned are appropriate. The main recommendation is to avoid wildcard imports for better clarity and security, but there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code in this fragment.",
