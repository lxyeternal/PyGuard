  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the modules 'file' and 'i', likely to include functions, classes, or variables into the current namespace for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'file' and 'i'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling points are present in these lines; they are simply import statements.",
  "flows": "Data flow details cannot be determined solely from import statements; no source-to-sink flow is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure what specific code is being imported, which may hide malicious or unintended code. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code in these lines themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports from two local modules. This pattern can be risky if the imported modules contain malicious code or hidden backdoors, but the snippet alone does not provide evidence of malicious intent. The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged because it can mask imported content, making auditing more difficult. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are visible in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet by itself does not show malicious activity. It merely imports contents from local modules, which could potentially contain malicious code, but there's no direct evidence here. The use of wildcard imports warrants caution as it can obscure malicious or unintended code in the imported modules.",
