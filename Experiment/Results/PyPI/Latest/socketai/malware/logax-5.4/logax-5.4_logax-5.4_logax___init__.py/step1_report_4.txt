  "purpose": "This code is importing all contents from modules named 'file' and 'i' within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statements (from .file import *, from .i import *)",
  "sinks": "Potentially imported module functions or variables that may handle untrusted data if used later",
  "flows": "Not explicitly shown, but depends on how imported modules are used in the rest of the codebase",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) which can obscure which functions or variables are brought into scope; no other suspicious or unusual code present",
  "analysis": "The code only contains relative imports with wildcard (*) syntax, which is generally discouraged due to lack of clarity and potential for hidden malicious imports. No direct malicious behavior or malicious code constructs are present in this snippet. Without additional context or usage, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The imports themselves are standard, albeit poorly structured, Python practice.\n\nNo sources, sinks, or suspicious data flows can be determined from this fragment alone. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are observable.\n\nOverall, the code is minimal and appears to be standard import statements with no direct malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet contains only import statements using wildcard imports from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on this code fragment. The use of wildcard imports is a code quality concern but not a security risk in itself.",
