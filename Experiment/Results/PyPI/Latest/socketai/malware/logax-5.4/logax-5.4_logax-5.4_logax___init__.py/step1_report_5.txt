  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from local modules 'file' and 'i'.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable due to lack of code execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Uses wildcard imports which can hide malicious or unintended code, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements using the '*' wildcard to import all contents from local modules 'file' and 'i'. This pattern can obscure which functions, classes, or variables are brought into scope, potentially hiding malicious code or unintended behavior. However, there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The code itself is minimal and does not perform any actions. The lack of further context or code limits the ability to fully assess the security implications, but based on this fragment alone, there are no clear indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code only performs wildcard imports from local modules, which could be a concern for code clarity or maintainability but does not demonstrate malicious behavior by itself. The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged due to obscurity, but no malicious intent can be confirmed here.",
