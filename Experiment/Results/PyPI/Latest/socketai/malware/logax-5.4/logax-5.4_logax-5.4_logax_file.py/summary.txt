  "conclusion": "The code's primary security concern is the unvalidated, silent execution of an external script ('i.py') using methods that can hide malicious activity. While the code itself is not malware, it provides a vector for malicious code execution, especially in untrusted environments. The high potential for exploitation justifies a malware score around 0.75 and a security risk score around 0.75-0.8. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, so the obfuscated score remains 0."
