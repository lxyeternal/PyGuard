{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'logax' Python package including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long_description; uses static strings for package metadata; imports 'setuptools' for packaging.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network connections, data leaks, or code execution points detected.",
  "flows": "Reads README file content, then proceeds with standard package setup process without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed; standard setup script with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to define package setup parameters. It reads a local README.md file for the description, which is standard. All package metadata is static and hardcoded. The dependencies specified are common packages ('requests', 'pybase64', 'importlib') with no dynamic or untrusted input involved. There are no network calls, data transmissions, or suspicious code constructs. The structure and content are typical of a legitimate Python setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
