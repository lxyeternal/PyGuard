{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for packaging a Python library named 'logax'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; the setup() function parameters for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data processing is present.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for description; passing static metadata to setup() — no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file to include as long description, then calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies include standard libraries and common packages; no user input or untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The code structure is typical for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies without any malicious intent.",
