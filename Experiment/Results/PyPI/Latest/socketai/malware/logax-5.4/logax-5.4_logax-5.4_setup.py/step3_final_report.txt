  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'logax' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading the README for long description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static package metadata definitions, listing dependencies.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data read from file and assigned to setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input. Dependencies are standard packages. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content and analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications needed.",
