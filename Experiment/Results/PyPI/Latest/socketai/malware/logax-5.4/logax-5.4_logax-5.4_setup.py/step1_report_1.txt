  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'logax', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description; defining package info and dependencies within setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or command executions are present",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file and passing static metadata and dependencies to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to configure package installation. It reads a README file for the long description, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies. There are no dynamic code executions, network interactions, or input/output flows that could be exploited. The dependencies listed are common libraries, and no malicious or suspicious code is evident in this script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard operations without any anomalies or malicious intents.",
