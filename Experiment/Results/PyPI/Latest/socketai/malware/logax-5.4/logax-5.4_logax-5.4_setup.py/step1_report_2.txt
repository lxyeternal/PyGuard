  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python library 'logax' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long_description; retrieving package dependencies from 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity; no execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading README content into 'long_description' (source) and specifying dependencies (source) for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a Markdown file for description and defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. Usage of 'setuptools' and reading a file are common, safe practices. Dependencies are explicitly listed without suspicious or unknown packages. No dynamic code, environment variables, or network activity occur here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
