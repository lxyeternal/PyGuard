      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, containing only import statements with wildcard syntax. The risk is low, and the scores assigned are appropriate. The main recommendation is to avoid wildcard imports for better clarity and security, but there is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code in this fragment."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code's primary security concern is the unvalidated, silent execution of an external script ('i.py') using methods that can hide malicious activity. While the code itself is not malware, it provides a vector for malicious code execution, especially in untrusted environments. The high potential for exploitation justifies a malware score around 0.75 and a security risk score around 0.75-0.8. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, so the obfuscated score remains 0."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious activity, including remote code download and execution with obfuscation and no validation. The high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are justified based on its capabilities and potential threat. It should be treated as highly suspicious and potentially malicious."
