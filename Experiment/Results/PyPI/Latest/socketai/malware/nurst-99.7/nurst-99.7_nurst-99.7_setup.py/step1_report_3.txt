{
  "purpose": "This setup script is intended to configure the installation of a Python package named 'nurst', including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code imports data from 'main' module during installation via 'from main import main' inside the custom 'run' method of 'CrazyInstallStrat'.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function from 'main' module is invoked during installation, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the flow goes from the setup process to the custom 'run' method, which imports and executes 'main()' from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a custom install command that calls 'main()' during setup is unusual and potentially suspicious, as it executes code at install time. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the default installation process with 'CrazyInstallStrat', which, after standard install steps, imports and runs 'main()' from an external module. This behavior can be used to execute arbitrary code during installation, which might be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious external connections are evident. The code relies on the presence of 'main.py' with a 'main()' function, and its behavior depends on that implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes a potentially arbitrary function during installation, which is suspicious and could be used maliciously if 'main()' contains malicious code. While not inherently malicious without knowing 'main()', this pattern warrants caution due to its potential for executing malicious payloads.",
