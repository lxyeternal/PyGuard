  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'nurst' that installs dependencies and executes a function from 'main' upon installation.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' module and calling 'main()' during the custom install command.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'main()' function from 'main' module during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, 'install.run(self)' executes, then 'from main import main' followed by 'main()' is called, executing code from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The 'CrazyInstallStrat' class executes arbitrary code ('main()') during installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main' performs harmful actions. The code imports 'main' dynamically and executes it unconditionally during install.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, after completing the standard install process, imports and executes a function 'main' from a local module. This behavior is atypical for setup scripts and could be used to run malicious or unwanted code during package installation. No other suspicious or malicious patterns, such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code, are present. The code relies on the presence of a 'main' module which may contain arbitrary code.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes an unusual and potentially malicious behavior by executing 'main()' from a local module during installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. This warrants suspicion, especially if 'main' performs harmful actions.",
