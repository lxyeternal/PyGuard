  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package named 'nurst' with a custom installation step that executes a function from 'main' during installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially the 'from main import main' inside the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'main' module during installation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method calls 'main()' from 'main', which is the only potential untrusted data execution point.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes 'main()' from an external module immediately after installation, which is unusual and potentially suspicious, as it may run arbitrary code at install time.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with standard fields and dependencies. It introduces a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the run() method to call 'main()' from 'main'. This behavior means that whenever the package is installed, it automatically executes code from 'main', which could be malicious or unwanted, especially if 'main' contains malicious code. There are no other obfuscated elements or hidden code, but the execution of external code during install is a security concern.\n\nThis pattern resembles a supply chain risk, where malicious code could be embedded in 'main' to execute malicious actions during package installation. Without inspecting 'main', the security implications depend on its content, but the act of running arbitrary code at install time is inherently risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a potentially malicious pattern of executing 'main()' from an external module during installation, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. This behavior is suspicious and warrants further review of the 'main' module to ensure it does not contain malicious code. Overall, the package has a security concern due to code execution during install.",
