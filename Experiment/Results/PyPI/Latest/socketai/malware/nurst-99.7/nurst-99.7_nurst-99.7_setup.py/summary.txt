  "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing external code during installation poses a high security risk, as it can be exploited to run malicious payloads. This pattern should be flagged as a supply chain security vulnerability. The code warrants further review of the 'main' module to ensure it does not contain malicious code. The overall malware score is set to 0.8, and the security risk score to 0.85, reflecting the high potential for malicious activity."
