  "flows": "system info (hostname, user, current path) -> URL encoding -> HTTP GET request to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains, no user consent prompts, sending detailed system info without user knowledge, hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names, use of random number for URL path which seems to serve as a tracking or identifier mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system hostname, username, and current directory, then generates a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to three different external domains. These domains are suspicious and likely used for tracking or data collection. The code does not perform any apparent malicious payload execution, but it actively exfiltrates system information to potentially malicious servers, which raises security concerns. The use of multiple URLs and encoded parameters suggests tracking or espionage activity rather than benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system information and exfiltrating it to external domains without user consent. It does not perform malicious actions like executing payloads but poses privacy and security risks due to data leakage. This pattern is consistent with surveillance or data theft behaviors.",
