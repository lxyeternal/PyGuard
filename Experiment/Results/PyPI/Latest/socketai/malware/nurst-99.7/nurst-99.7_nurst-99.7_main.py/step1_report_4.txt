{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs, possibly for monitoring or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - reading system hostname, username, and current directory; and the URL list as static sources.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) - sending data over HTTP requests to external domains.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) is encoded into URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes collecting system info and sending it to suspicious, non-standard domains without any clear user consent or documentation. The URLs appear malicious or maliciously obfuscated. The use of random number in URL path may be to avoid detection or to correlate data. No clear purpose is provided; no user interaction is involved.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters plus a random number, and sends HTTP GET requests to these URLs. The URLs are suspicious, potentially malicious domains, possibly designed for data collection or exfiltration. The code does not include any user prompts or documented intent, raising suspicion. It uses standard libraries but leverages them to send potentially sensitive system info to unknown servers. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft beyond system info are evident, but the pattern of data exfiltration to suspicious domains indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be used for unauthorized data collection or exfiltration from the host machine, communicating with suspicious external domains. It is likely malicious, with a high malware score. The behavior suggests covert data transmission without user consent.",
