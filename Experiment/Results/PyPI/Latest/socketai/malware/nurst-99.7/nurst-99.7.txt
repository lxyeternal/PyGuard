      "conclusion": "The setup script's behavior of executing external code during installation poses a high security risk, as it can be exploited to run malicious payloads. This pattern should be flagged as a supply chain security vulnerability. The code warrants further review of the 'main' module to ensure it does not contain malicious code. The overall malware score is set to 0.8, and the security risk score to 0.85, reflecting the high potential for malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates covert data exfiltration to suspicious external domains, indicating malicious or highly suspicious behavior. The scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment. The overall malware likelihood is high, and the security risk is significant due to privacy violations. The code should be considered malicious, with a malware score around 0.9 and a security risk score around 0.85."
