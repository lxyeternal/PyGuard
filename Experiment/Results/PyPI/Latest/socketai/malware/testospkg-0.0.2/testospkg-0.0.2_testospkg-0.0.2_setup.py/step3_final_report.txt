  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools, containing static configuration data with no dynamic or external code.",
  "sources": "Package metadata fields such as name, version, description, classifiers, and the call to find_packages()",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is purely declarative with static data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration with no dynamic code, input handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static nature. No evidence suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The assessments are accurate, and the risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports and scores are appropriate and consistent. No further action or concern is warranted.",
