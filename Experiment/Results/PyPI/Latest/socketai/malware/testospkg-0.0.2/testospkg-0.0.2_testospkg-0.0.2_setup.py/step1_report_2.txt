  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'testospkg' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function and its arguments, including package discovery via find_packages() and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to executing setup() with package parameters, with no untrusted data handling or external data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "All code appears standard for a Python package setup; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, specifies package metadata, and calls setup() with standard parameters. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. There are no external data inputs, no network connections, and no embedded code executing dynamically or handling sensitive information. The commented lines are harmless placeholders. Overall, the code appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
