  "purpose": "Import the function 'say_hello' from a local module named 'hello'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'hello' when importing 'say_hello'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import statement pulls in code from 'hello', but there is no further data flow or execution shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement, with no evidence of suspicious or malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a relative module, which is a common practice. No external data, network operations, or suspicious constructs are present. Since the code is very minimal, there's no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The absence of additional code limits further analysis but based on this fragment alone, there are no signs of malware or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import from a local module with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
