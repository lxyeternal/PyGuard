  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a simple import statement",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module, which is standard in Python projects. No input reading, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns. The module 'hello' is presumably a local dependency, and the import itself does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues.",
