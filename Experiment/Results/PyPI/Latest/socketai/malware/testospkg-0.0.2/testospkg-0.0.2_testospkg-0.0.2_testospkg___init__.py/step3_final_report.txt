  "purpose": "To perform a security assessment of a minimal Python import statement for potential malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .hello import say_hello' as it reads the local module 'hello'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a function without executing or transmitting data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of 'say_hello' from a local module 'hello'. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code is standard and lacks any suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statement is standard Python practice, and the scores reflect this. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
