  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Issue presence:** The code is a simple import statement; no issues are present.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** None identified.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature. The low security risk score aligns with the minimal code.  \n   - **Justification:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are indicated. The confidence score of 0.9 is appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Issue presence:** Again, a straightforward import with no signs of issues.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 seem appropriate.  \n   - **Justification:** No malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The confidence score of 1 indicates high certainty of benignity.\n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above; minimal import statement.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 are justified.  \n   - **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity; the confidence score of 0.9 is suitable.\n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Issue presence:** The code remains a simple import.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are reasonable.  \n   - **Justification:** No malicious indicators; the low risk score matches the minimal code.\n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Issue presence:** Same as previous; no issues detected.  \n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 are appropriate.  \n   - **Justification:** No malicious behavior; high confidence of benignity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly indicate no malware (score=0).  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are straightforward import statements, so obfuscation is correctly scored as 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the simplicity and benign nature, the risk scores are appropriately low (mostly 0 or 0.1). No evidence suggests higher risk.\n\n### Overall:\n\n- The code is benign across all reports.  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all cases.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all cases.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 at most, reflecting very minimal concern, which aligns with the current scores.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; the scores are justified based on the provided code snippet.",
