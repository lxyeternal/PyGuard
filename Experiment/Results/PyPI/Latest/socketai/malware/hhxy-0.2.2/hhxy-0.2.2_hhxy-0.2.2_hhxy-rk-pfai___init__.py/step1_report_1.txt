{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize and run a web server or network service, potentially for handling HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from network sockets or HTTP request handlers, though explicit input sources are not clearly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, HTTP responses, or external system commands executed within the server logic.",
  "flows": "Input data from network connections or HTTP requests flows into processing functions, which may then influence responses or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution are immediately evident. The code structure appears typical for server setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes server components, binds to network ports, and handles incoming requests. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. Usage of standard libraries and patterns suggests typical server code. Absence of hidden code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious network activity indicators reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard server setup with no malicious intent. However, without full context or runtime data, this assessment cannot be absolute.",
