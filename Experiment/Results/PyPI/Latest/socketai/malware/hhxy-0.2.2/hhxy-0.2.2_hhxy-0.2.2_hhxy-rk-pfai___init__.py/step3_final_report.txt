  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via data processing, network requests, or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data handling, backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign with standard patterns; no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious network activity detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual data flows observed. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low security risk score (0.2) aligns with the benign assessment, and malware likelihood is zero. Confidence is high (0.9), given the lack of suspicious features and straightforward code. No anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action required.",
