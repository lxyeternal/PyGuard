{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, dependencies, and the README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data outputs or system calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to potentially malicious sinks; configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or unusual code patterns. The only dynamic element is reading the README file, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script using setuptools. It specifies author information, dependencies, package discovery, and console entry points. The author email, URL, and dependencies appear legitimate. The entry point references a function in 'main.py', which cannot be evaluated here but appears standard. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are detected. The script performs typical package setup tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package setup script.",
