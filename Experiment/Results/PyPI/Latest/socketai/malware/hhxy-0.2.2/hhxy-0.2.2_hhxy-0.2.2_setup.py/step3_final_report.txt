  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, dependencies, and entry point for installation and execution.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long description; referencing external function 'install_and_run' in 'hhxy.main'.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'install_and_run' function, which could execute arbitrary code depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Setup script references 'install_and_run' as an entry point; actual execution depends on external code in 'hhxy.main'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected within this script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration using setuptools, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The only external component is the 'install_and_run' function, whose content is unknown and could potentially be malicious, but this cannot be assessed from this script alone. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code is present here. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code clarity. The risk score is minimal (0), reflecting the potential risk associated with the external function, but since the function's implementation is not provided, the setup script itself is safe. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9 to 1).",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. The primary security concern hinges on the implementation of 'install_and_run' in 'hhxy.main', which is outside the scope of this code review. Based solely on this script, no malicious activity is detected, and the scores reflect a safe package configuration.",
