  "purpose": "Configure the package setup for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'install_and_run' function from 'hhxy.main' via console script.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows detected; setup configuration does not process external inputs or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The entry point references a function that could be malicious, but the code itself is standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It specifies metadata like author, email, description, dependencies, and entry points. No external inputs, no code execution beyond standard setup procedures. The entry point points to 'install_and_run' in 'hhxy.main', which may contain executable code, but that is outside this snippet. No malicious behaviors or anomalies are evident in this setup script itself.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious activity. The potential risk depends on the implementation of 'install_and_run' in the 'hhxy.main' module, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears safe.",
