{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the package description from './README.md'; processes package dependencies; specifies entry point for command-line script.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'install_and_run' function in 'hhxy.main' module via command line entry point.",
  "flows": "User invokes 'hhxy-pfai' command -> executes 'hhxy.main:install_and_run' function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The description is in Chinese, but this alone is not suspicious. No hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports 'setuptools' modules to configure packaging. It reads package metadata and dependencies, and sets a console script entry point. The code structure is standard for Python packages. The only dynamic element is reading the README file, which is typical. The 'install_and_run' function is referenced but not provided, so its contents are unknown; however, the setup script itself appears benign. No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution and installation.",
