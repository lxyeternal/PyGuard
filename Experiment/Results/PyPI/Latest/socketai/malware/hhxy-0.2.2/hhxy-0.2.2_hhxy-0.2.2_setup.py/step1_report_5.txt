  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long description; reading package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (README.md, package dependencies) flow into setup configuration; no external untrusted data flow to code execution or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure package distribution. It specifies author information, description, dependencies, entry points, and metadata. The only potentially sensitive operation is reading 'README.md' for long description, which is a common practice. No code injection, obfuscated code, or malicious activities detected. The 'entry_points' define a console script that calls a function in 'main.py', but without the content of 'main.py', we cannot assess its behavior. Based on this script alone, there are no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a typical package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard setup tasks and does not include suspicious code or external data leaks.",
