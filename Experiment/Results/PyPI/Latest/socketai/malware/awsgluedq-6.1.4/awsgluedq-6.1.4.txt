      "conclusion": "This package exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious software—repeated unsolicited outbound network requests to a suspicious domain during import and installation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this behavior. It should be flagged as highly suspicious or malicious and avoided in supply chain deployments."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious or covert activity due to its connection to an obscure domain on a non-standard port without validation. The current scores are appropriate; I recommend setting the malware score to 0.75 and the security risk to 0.75, with an obfuscation score of 0. The pattern suggests high suspicion of malicious intent, warranting further investigation."
