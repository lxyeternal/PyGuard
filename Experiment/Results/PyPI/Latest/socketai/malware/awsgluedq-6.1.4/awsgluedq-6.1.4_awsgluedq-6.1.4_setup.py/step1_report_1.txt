{
  "purpose": "To define and install a Python package with a custom post-installation step that makes an HTTP request to an external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it makes an outbound HTTP GET request to a specified URL using the 'requests' library during module import and in a custom install command.",
  "sinks": "The outbound 'requests.get' call transmits data to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq', which could potentially leak information or be used for malicious communication.",
  "flows": "The code initiates an HTTP GET request at import time and again during the custom installation process, sending a request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated outbound requests to an external IP and domain during module import and post-install, which is unusual for a standard package. No hardcoded secrets but the external communication is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and the 'requests' library, then immediately makes a GET request to an external server upon import, which is suspicious and may indicate data exfiltration or malicious command-and-control communication. A custom install class executes this request again during installation, amplifying concern. No other malicious code or obfuscated logic is present. The repeated external requests and their external destination point toward malicious or at least suspicious behavior, potentially for data exfiltration or command-and-control activities. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are evident, but the external communication itself is a significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits malicious behavior by making outbound requests to an external server both at import time and during installation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or remote control. The code is not obfuscated but contains suspicious external communication. It should be considered highly risky for inclusion in any environment.",
