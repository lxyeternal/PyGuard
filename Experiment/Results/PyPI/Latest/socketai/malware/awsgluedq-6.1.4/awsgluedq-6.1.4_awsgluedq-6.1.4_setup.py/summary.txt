  "conclusion": "This package exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious software—repeated unsolicited outbound network requests to a suspicious domain during import and installation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this behavior. It should be flagged as highly suspicious or malicious and avoided in supply chain deployments."
