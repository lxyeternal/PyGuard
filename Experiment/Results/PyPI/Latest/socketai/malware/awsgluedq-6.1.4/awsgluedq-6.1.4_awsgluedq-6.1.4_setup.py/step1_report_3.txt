{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom install command that performs a network request during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the network via requests.get() calls to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq'. It also reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "The network requests send data to an external server, potentially leaking system or user information if the server collects data. No other data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "The installation process triggers the custom install command, which executes 'post_install()' function. This function performs an HTTP GET request to an external server during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an external HTTP request during installation, which is unusual and suspicious. The target URL appears arbitrary and potentially malicious. The request is made twice: once at import time and once during post-install, indicating possible malicious intent to communicate with an external server at install time.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and then immediately performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external server. It defines a post-install function that repeats this request, and a custom install class that calls this function during installation. This behavior is unusual for benign packages and suggests an intent to contact an external server covertly during setup. The 'setup' function registers this custom install class, ensuring the request runs on install. No code appears to handle sensitive data or execute malicious payloads beyond the network request. However, the repeated contact with an external server during setup indicates potential malicious behavior, such as remote command/control, data exfiltration, or establishing a backdoor. The code also reads the 'README.md' file, which is standard, but the presence of the network request during install is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its behavior of making external network requests during package installation, which could be used for malicious purposes such as remote communication or data exfiltration. The pattern of repeated requests to an obscure URL indicates malicious intent rather than benign functionality.",
