{
  "purpose": "To define and install a Python package with a custom post-install step that performs an HTTP GET request to a specific server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network through the requests.get() call, both at the top level and within the post_install() function.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP GET request to http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq potentially transmits or receives data from an external server; the code itself does not process or handle the response meaningfully.",
  "flows": "Initial requests.get() executes immediately upon module import. The post_install() function is called after package installation, executing the same request again.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an unsolicited network request to an external domain without any user interaction, configuration, or clear purpose. The repeated request upon import and post-installation is unusual and potentially malicious. No validation or logging is present. The URL and port could be suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and performs an external HTTP request both at the start and during a custom install process. The request to pov.sh:45111 occurs automatically, with no condition or user consent. The package setup overrides the install command to run the request during installation, which could be used to track, fingerprint, or exfiltrate data without user awareness. The lack of response handling, logging, or validation increases suspicion. Overall, the code appears designed to make external network requests during package installation, which could be malicious or at least suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious potential by executing unsolicited network requests during import and installation, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. This behavior indicates a high security risk, as it can operate without user knowledge and send data to an external server.",
