{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup with a custom post-installation step that makes an HTTP GET request to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata from README.md, and makes an HTTP request via requests.get to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq' during import and post-install.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data to an external server, potentially leaking environment or system info. The code does not include other untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves reading package description from README.md, then during installation, executing the custom run method which performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an unsolicited network request to a suspicious domain ('pov.sh') during import and post-install, which is unusual for typical package setup. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and 'requests'. It performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL immediately upon import and again during post-install. The setup() function includes a custom install command that executes this request as part of the package installation process. The remote URL is obscure and possibly malicious, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious command and control communication. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be designed to contact an external server during package installation, which is suspicious behavior in supply chain security context.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious-like behavior by making external network requests during import and installation, potentially for data exfiltration or malicious control. The repeated contact to a suspicious domain indicates malicious intent or a backdoor. Overall, the code is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious.",
