{
  "purpose": "The code makes outbound HTTP GET requests to a suspicious external server both at import time and during package installation, likely for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, command-and-control, or tracking.",
  "sources": "Requests made immediately upon import and during the custom post-install command execution.",
  "sinks": "External server at http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/awsgluedq receiving outbound GET requests.",
  "flows": "Import triggers an outbound request; during installation, the custom command runs post_install(), which makes the same request again.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated outbound requests to an external, suspicious domain during import and install without any response validation, logging, or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs two unsolicited network requests to a suspicious domain during critical setup phases, which is highly unusual for legitimate packages. The requests are unvalidated and occur without user interaction, indicating potential malicious intent such as data exfiltration or remote command execution. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or payloads, but the network behavior alone is a red flag. The high frequency and external domain suggest malicious or backdoor behavior, justifying high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "This package exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious software—repeated unsolicited outbound network requests to a suspicious domain during import and installation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this behavior. It should be flagged as highly suspicious or malicious and avoided in supply chain deployments.",
