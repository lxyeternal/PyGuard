  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'infoind' with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from distutils.core, static setup configuration data",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external data handling detected",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only specifies package setup details",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using distutils. It includes package metadata, author info, URL, download link, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, external data inputs, or suspicious behaviors. The download URL appears to be a placeholder but not inherently malicious. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
