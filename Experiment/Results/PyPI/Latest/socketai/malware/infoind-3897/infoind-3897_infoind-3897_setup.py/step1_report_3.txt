  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'infoind'.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of package metadata, list of dependencies in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no execution or data handling at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools' may suggest outdated or minimal setup; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for publishing a Python package, with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code execution, input handling, or dynamic behavior present. The package information appears benign, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The use of 'distutils.core' is not inherently malicious but is outdated; however, this alone is not a security concern. No hardcoded credentials, malicious scripts, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and safe, serving only to define package metadata for distribution. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
