  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, author information, dependencies, and URL fields from the setup arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through author_email and URL fields; no untrusted data execution present.",
  "flows": "No external data flow or untrusted input processing; static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Version number appears numeric but not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only distutils.core's setup function to define package metadata and dependencies. All data appears static and typical for a setup script. There are no inputs from external sources or execution of dynamic code. No suspicious network activity, credential leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The setup script is straightforward and standard for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any untrusted data handling or malicious actions. The code is benign.",
