  "purpose": "Package setup configuration for a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Static strings in the setup() call: name, packages, version, license, description, author, author_email, url, download_url, keywords, install_requires, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional version number '3897', use of 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools', but these are not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static setup script with package metadata. No dynamic code, user input, or untrusted data is processed. The use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not insecure. URLs and author info are benign. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports correctly reflect the benign nature: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Confidence levels are high, given the static and clear code. The minor concern about outdated tools does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety. The malware and obfuscated scores should be 0, and the risk score should also be 0, reflecting no security concerns.",
