  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the 'infoind.osint' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as it's only an import statement.",
  "flows": "None, since no functions are invoked or data is processed beyond the import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement with no further context. The module 'infoind.osint' could potentially contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this single line.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import operation from 'infoind.osint'. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious payloads in this snippet. The presence of the import alone does not indicate malicious intent, but the safety depends on the contents of the imported module. Without additional code or context, this line alone appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic import statement with no evident malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal at this point, but further review of the 'infoind.osint' module is recommended to ensure it is safe.",
