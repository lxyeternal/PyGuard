  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of importing the 'infoind.osint' module in Python code.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from infoind.osint import *' reads the module 'infoind.osint'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential risks depend on the contents of 'infoind.osint', which are not visible here.",
  "flows": "The import loads all functions/classes from 'infoind.osint' into the namespace; no further data flow is observable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import, which is benign by itself. The security concern hinges on the contents of 'infoind.osint', which cannot be assessed from this snippet. The use of wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and risk score is minimal (0.1), reflecting the low likelihood of malicious activity based solely on this line. The confidence score is high (around 0.9) that the code itself is safe, but further analysis of the imported module is recommended before deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign; no malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The security risk is minimal, contingent on the trustworthiness of 'infoind.osint'. Further review of the module's content is advised for comprehensive security assurance.",
