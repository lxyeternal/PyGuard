  "purpose": "The script manages database version verification, backups, and data migration for BitcoinLib, ensuring compatibility and proper updates.",
  "sources": "User input for confirmation, database files for reading and writing, and internal SQL queries for data extraction.",
  "sinks": "File move operations for backups, database insertions for data migration, and user prompts controlling process flow.",
  "flows": "User input triggers backup and migration; data flows from backup database to new database via SQL queries; files are moved based on user confirmation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation or malicious code detected; redundant imports noted but benign; reliance on user input without sanitization is standard for such scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard database version checking, backup, and migration tasks. It uses raw SQL queries for data extraction, which are safe here since data is internal. User prompts control process flow; no external network activity or hardcoded secrets are present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical maintenance utilities. The use of file operations and user prompts introduces operational risk but not security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting operational considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard database migration utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified given the nature of file handling and user prompts. Scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
