  "conclusion": "This code is primarily a data collection and exfiltration tool with high potential for misuse due to hardcoded secrets and broad data transmission capabilities. While it does not contain active malware or obfuscation, its design facilitates covert data theft, warranting a high security risk assessment. It should be treated with caution, and the hardcoded credentials should be removed or secured to prevent misuse."
