  "purpose": "This code sets up the package exports and conditionally runs pre-install checks during import.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.cli, .version, .installer).",
  "sinks": "The call to run_pre_install() which executes during import if available.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to the conditional execution of run_pre_install() if .installer is present.",
  "anomalies": "The run_pre_install() function is called during import, which could execute arbitrary code at import time. However, without seeing its implementation, this is not inherently suspicious; it's a common pattern for pre-install hooks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package metadata and setup procedures. The only potentially notable aspect is the execution of run_pre_install() during import, which could be used maliciously if run_pre_install() contains harmful code. Since run_pre_install() is imported from a local module, its content is unknown; however, this pattern is typical for pre-install checks. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or external network activity evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package setup code with a conditional pre-install hook. There is no clear evidence of malicious intent based solely on this snippet, but the execution of run_pre_install() warrants review of that function's implementation for security considerations.",
