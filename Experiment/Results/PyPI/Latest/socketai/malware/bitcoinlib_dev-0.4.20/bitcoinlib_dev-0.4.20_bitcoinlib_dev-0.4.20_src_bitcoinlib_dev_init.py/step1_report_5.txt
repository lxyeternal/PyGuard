{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, designed to expose main functions and version info, and to run pre-install checks during package installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'main', '__version__', and 'run_pre_install'; the try-except block that conditionally executes run_pre_install()",
  "sinks": "The run_pre_install() function if it contains untrusted operations, but not directly visible here",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to the potential execution of run_pre_install during import time",
  "anomalies": "The call to run_pre_install() during module import is notable; without knowing its implementation, it could potentially perform unexpected actions, but the current code only invokes it if present",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and variables, exposing them via __all__ for external access. During import, it attempts to run run_pre_install() if available, which is intended for pre-install checks. No explicit malicious code or data handling is present. The pattern is typical for package setup routines, with the only concern being the conditional execution of run_pre_install(), which depends on its internal implementation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard for Python packages, exposing core functions and version info, and conditionally executing pre-install checks. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
