  "purpose": "Defines package exports and conditionally runs a pre-install check during package import.",
  "sources": "Importing .cli, .version, and optionally .installer modules; executing run_pre_install if available.",
  "sinks": "The run_pre_install function, which could perform arbitrary operations, is called during import.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> execution of run_pre_install if .installer is present -> no further data flows observable.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install during import could potentially execute arbitrary code if the module is malicious, but this depends on the implementation of run_pre_install.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and attempts to run a pre-install hook by importing run_pre_install. If run_pre_install contains malicious code, it could execute during package import, which is a common tactic for executing code stealthily. However, the code itself does not contain any malicious logic or suspicious constructs. The try-except pattern ensures that the absence of the .installer module does not cause failure. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident. The main concern is the potential for run_pre_install to perform malicious actions if the implementation is compromised or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard package initialization tasks with conditional pre-install checks. No explicit malicious behavior is detected in this snippet. However, the execution of run_pre_install during import warrants review of its implementation for security concerns. Overall, the code appears benign but relies on the trustworthiness of run_pre_install.",
