  "purpose": "The code initializes the package by importing core modules, setting __all__, and conditionally executing run_pre_install() during import if available.",
  "sources": "Imports from .cli, .version, and optionally from .installer for run_pre_install()",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_pre_install() during import, which could run arbitrary code if malicious",
  "flows": "Import statements → attempt to import run_pre_install → call run_pre_install() if imported successfully",
  "anomalies": "Execution of run_pre_install() during import without explicit control, potential risk if the function is malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py pattern exposing main and version, with a conditional pre-install hook. The main concern is the execution of run_pre_install() during import, which could be malicious if the function contains harmful code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are visible. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the limited information. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the pattern's commonality but acknowledging the unknown implementation of run_pre_install().",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and standard for package initialization, with the main risk stemming from executing an external function during import. Without inspecting run_pre_install(), no malicious activity can be confirmed. The scores are consistent with this assessment, indicating low malware likelihood but some caution due to import-time execution.",
