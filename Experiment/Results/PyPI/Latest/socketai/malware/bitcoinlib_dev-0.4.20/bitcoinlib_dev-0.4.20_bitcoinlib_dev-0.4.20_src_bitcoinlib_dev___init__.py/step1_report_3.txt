  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple script that performs some operations involving input data, possibly for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the user via input() functions and possibly from environment variables or external files (if present).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data using print() statements and writes to files or network sockets if such code exists within the script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables to processing functions, then potentially to output functions or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code constructs observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found. No apparent malicious logic such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with typical input/output operations. No signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or unsafe evaluations. The structure is simple and clear, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. Without further code context, it appears to be benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It seems to be a standard utility or processing script with no harmful behavior.",
