  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "User input, environment variables, network operations, file I/O, third-party libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data output.",
  "flows": "Sources (input/env) leading to sinks (network/file) via code logic, with no suspicious or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "All reports with no code provide appropriate zero scores, indicating no malicious activity. Reports with code describe benign patterns, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with low security risk (~0.2). The scores are consistent with the benign analysis. Slightly elevated security risk scores (0.2) are conservative but acceptable given potential minor concerns. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise is present.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates the code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
