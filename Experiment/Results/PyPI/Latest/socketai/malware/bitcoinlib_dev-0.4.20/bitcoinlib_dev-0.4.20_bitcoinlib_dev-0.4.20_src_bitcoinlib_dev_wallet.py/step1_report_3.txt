{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to manage Bitcoin wallets, including creating wallets, listing them, generating keys, importing transactions from files, and sending transactions.",
  "sources": "Reading input from args object, reading transaction data from files, wallet and key generation functions, and network/database configurations.",
  "sinks": "Wallet creation and transaction functions which send data to the Bitcoin network, printing output, and file reading operations.",
  "flows": "Input args (wallet_name, network, passphrase, database, etc.) → Wallet operations (create, import, send) → Network broadcast or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or suspicious code structures. Wallet and key generation are standard. No obfuscated code or hidden network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard functions from the bitcoinlib library for wallet management. It accepts user input via args object, creates wallets, generates keys, and handles transactions. Transaction data is imported from JSON files and sent over the network. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, nor does it perform suspicious network connections beyond legitimate Bitcoin network communication. All operations are typical for wallet management software.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate wallet management script utilizing the bitcoinlib library. It performs standard operations without suspicious or malicious intent. No signs of malware or malicious data handling are evident. The overall security risk is low, assuming the bitcoinlib library is trusted.",
