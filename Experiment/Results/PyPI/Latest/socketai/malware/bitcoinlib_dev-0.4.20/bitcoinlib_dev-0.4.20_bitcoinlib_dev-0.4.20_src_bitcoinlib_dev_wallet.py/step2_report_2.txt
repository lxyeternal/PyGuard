  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual behavior, the reasoning provided, and the scoring assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a typical Bitcoin wallet management script utilizing the bitcoinlib library.\n- It performs standard functions: create wallets, generate keys, import transactions, send transactions, list wallets.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are reported.\n- Several reports highlight that passphrases and private keys are printed in plain text, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific report review:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, just security concern about passphrases printed.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable, as exposure of passphrases is a security concern but not an active threat.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Logical flaws:** The code seems straightforward; no issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard wallet functions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0 — appropriate.\n- **Logic:** Clear, standard, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard operations, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n- **Logic:** Consistent with the previous reports.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Highlights that sensitive info (passphrases, keys) are printed, which is a security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.3, obfuscated 0.\n- **Note:** The increased risk score (0.3) reflects the security concern, which is justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly identified. No malware or obfuscation. The higher risk score is justified due to sensitive info exposure.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard wallet management, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.\n- **Logic:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.2, with one report at 0.3 due to printing sensitive info. This is appropriate.\n\n### **Final thoughts:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of wallet management using a well-known library.\n- The main security concern is the printing of passphrases and private keys, which is a standard security practice concern but not malicious.\n- No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious activities are present.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 to 0.3 — primarily due to security best practice violations (printing sensitive info). I would assign a **risk score of 0.25** as an average.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign but has security best practice issues regarding sensitive data exposure. No changes to the scoring are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.25 (average of 0.2 and 0.3)",
