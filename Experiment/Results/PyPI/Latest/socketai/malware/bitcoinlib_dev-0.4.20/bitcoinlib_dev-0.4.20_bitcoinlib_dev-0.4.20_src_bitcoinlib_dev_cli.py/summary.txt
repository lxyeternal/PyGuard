  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate wallet management CLI with no active malware or obfuscation. The primary concern is the insecure transmission of sensitive data via send_to_all(), which could lead to data leaks if the underlying method transmits data externally or logs it insecurely. The malware score remains at 0, but the security risk score should be increased to approximately 0.4 to reflect this potential vulnerability."
