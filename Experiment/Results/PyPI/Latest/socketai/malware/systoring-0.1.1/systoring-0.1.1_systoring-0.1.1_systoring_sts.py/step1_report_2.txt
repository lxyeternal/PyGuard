{
  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection, InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input monitoring, MacMonitor().run or WindowsMonitor().run for system monitoring.",
  "sinks": "Threads executing monitoring functions; no direct data leakage or malicious data flows evident.",
  "flows": "Detection of OS → Starting input monitor thread → Starting system monitor thread based on OS",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the operating system, then starts input monitoring and system monitoring in separate threads. It imports monitoring classes and invokes their methods accordingly. No code injection, network activity, or credential handling is present. The monitoring functions' internal implementations are not shown, but the code itself appears to straightforwardly initiate monitoring tasks based on platform detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a legitimate system monitoring setup, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. It does not contain hardcoded secrets or malicious operations within the provided scope.",
