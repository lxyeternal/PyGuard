  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring by starting input and system monitoring threads for macOS and Windows.",
  "sources": "Reads platform.system() to determine OS. Instantiates InputMonitor and platform-specific monitoring classes.",
  "targets": "Starts threads that run monitoring functions, which may collect system or input data.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> determines platform -> starts InputMonitor().start_monitoring -> starts platform-specific run() method in threads.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or unusual code. Use of threading for monitoring is standard. No hidden or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports platform information and dynamically starts threads for input and system monitoring based on OS detection. Monitoring classes are instantiated and run in separate threads, which is typical for such tasks. No suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activities are evident. The code appears to be part of a legitimate monitoring setup without malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for platform-specific monitoring, with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It uses standard threading and conditional logic for platform detection. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected.",
