  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring threads for macOS and Windows.",
  "sources": "platform.system() to determine OS, instantiation of monitoring classes, threading.Thread to run monitors.",
  "secrets": "No hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or secrets observed.",
  "sinks": "Thread targets executing monitoring functions, which could potentially read sensitive system data.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional logic -> thread creation -> start_monitoring or run methods.",
  "anomalies": "Standard use of threading for monitoring; no unusual code constructs or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically detects the OS and spawns threads to run platform-specific monitoring classes. The classes imported appear to perform system monitoring tasks based on their names, with no evidence of malicious actions. The use of threading for monitoring is typical. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The logic is straightforward and aligns with legitimate monitoring functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code initializes platform-dependent system monitoring threads in a standard manner without evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
