{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enums from internal packages for use in other parts of a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; it only imports and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected; no dynamic code execution or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and enums from internal modules, then exposes them via __all__ for external use. It does not process input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. As such, it appears to be a straightforward module setup without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module definition for organizing imports and exports, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
