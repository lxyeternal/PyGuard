  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes and enums for use in a larger project, likely related to Windows monitoring and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no processing of untrusted input or data leaks detected",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; code only defines imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific components from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. It does not process data, execute dynamic code, or perform any network or system actions. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import and export module with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions to expose selected classes and enums for use elsewhere, with no suspicious activity.",
