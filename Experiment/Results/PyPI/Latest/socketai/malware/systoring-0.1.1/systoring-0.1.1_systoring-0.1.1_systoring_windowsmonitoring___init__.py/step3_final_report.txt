  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing specific modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Local module files: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "flows": "Import statements from local modules to the module namespace; no data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py file that imports classes and enums from local modules and defines __all__ for module exports. It contains only static import statements with no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
