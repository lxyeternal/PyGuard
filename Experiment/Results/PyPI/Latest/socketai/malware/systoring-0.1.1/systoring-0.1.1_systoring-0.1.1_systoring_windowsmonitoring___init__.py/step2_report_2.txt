  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward __init__.py module that imports classes and enums from local modules and exposes them via __all__.\n- No report indicates any dynamic code execution, network activity, handling of untrusted input, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- The code snippets are minimal and consistent with standard Python package initialization patterns.\n\n**Confirming the code's content:**\n- The actual code provided matches all reports: it only imports from local modules and defines __all__.\n- There are no signs of embedded malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Purpose: Correctly identifies the code as a package initializer.  \n   - Malware score: 0 — justified, no malicious activity.  \n   - Risk score: 0 — appropriate, no security issues.  \n   - Confidence: 1 — accurate.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the code.  \n   - Malware score: 0 — justified.  \n   - Risk score: 0 — appropriate.  \n   - Confidence: 1.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Slightly lower confidence (1.0) but still justified.  \n   - Malware score: 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n   - Security risk: 0.1 — minimal, likely just a conservative default for such modules.  \n   - The reasoning is sound; no issues here.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Same conclusion: straightforward import/export module.  \n   - Malware score: 0 — justified.  \n   - Risk score: 0 — appropriate.  \n   - Confidence: 1.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Consistent with others; no suspicious activity.  \n   - Malware score: 0 — justified.  \n   - Risk score: 0 — appropriate.  \n   - Confidence: 1.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is a standard module initializer with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The risk scores are correctly low (0), given the absence of any security concern.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No adjustments needed; all assessments are consistent and justified.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign __init__.py module for a Python package, with no malicious or security issues detected.",
