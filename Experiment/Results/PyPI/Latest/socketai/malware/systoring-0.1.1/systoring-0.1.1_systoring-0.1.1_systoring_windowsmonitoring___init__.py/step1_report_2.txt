{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initialization file that imports specific classes and variables from local modules for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "The module imports classes and variables which are then exposed via __all__, facilitating their use elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual code structures are present in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward __init__.py pattern, importing components for package exposure. It does not contain dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors are visible. The code is minimal and appears legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple module initializer for a Python package, exposing selected components.",
