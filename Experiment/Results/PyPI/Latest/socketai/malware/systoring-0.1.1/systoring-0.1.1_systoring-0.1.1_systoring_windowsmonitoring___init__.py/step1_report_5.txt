  "purpose": "Module exports for Windows monitoring and utility classes/enums",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system modification code present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; just module imports and export definitions",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration to specify exported symbols. It imports classes and enums from local modules and re-exports them. No external data sources, network activity, or runtime evaluation is present. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs identified. The code appears to be a straightforward package component setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export setup with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to organize and expose classes and enums for other parts of the package, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
