  "purpose": "This code appears to be an __init__.py file for a Python package, exporting modules and classes related to Windows monitoring and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; solely imports and __all__ declaration",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; module imports do not process external data",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any embedded or suspicious code; straightforward module import statements",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes and functions from local modules and declares exports. It does not perform data processing, network operations, or handle untrusted input. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The structure indicates standard package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It simply re-exports components for external use.",
