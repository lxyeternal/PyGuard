{
  "purpose": "The code performs platform-dependent imports for system monitoring modules, importing WindowsMonitoring on Windows systems and other modules unconditionally.",
  "sources": "The platform.system() call for platform detection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional import of WindowsMonitoring -> import of other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward platform check and module import.",
  "analysis": "The code is syntactically correct and implements a common pattern for cross-platform module loading. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or suspicious code. The conditional import based on platform is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The malware score is justified as 0, and the security risk is minimal. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. The current assessment scores are appropriate; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
