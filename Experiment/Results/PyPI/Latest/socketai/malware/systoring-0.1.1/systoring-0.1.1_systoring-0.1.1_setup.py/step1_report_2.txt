{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'systoring' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long_description; specifies package dependencies in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted input or execute code dynamically.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script primarily defines package configuration without data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs. The description mentions monitoring and educational purposes, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities, reads a Markdown file for description, and defines package metadata including dependencies and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling from external sources are present. The dependencies relate to input monitoring and OS-specific features, which are consistent with system monitoring tools. No evidence of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears intended for package distribution with monitoring functionalities implied by dependencies but no actual malicious or suspicious code present.",
