{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; static package metadata fields; dependencies specified in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static configuration without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows typical setup.py pattern, no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. It reads a markdown file for description, specifies dependencies, and includes platform-specific extras. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is evident. Dependencies are common for system monitoring tools, matching the package's purpose. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise are detected. All indicators point to benign, standard setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and high confidence are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
