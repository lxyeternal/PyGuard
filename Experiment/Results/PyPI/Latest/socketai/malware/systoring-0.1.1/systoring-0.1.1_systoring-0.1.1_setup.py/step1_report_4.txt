  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is standard setup.py configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The dependencies listed are common for a monitoring library and do not indicate malicious intent. No external network connections, backdoors, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
