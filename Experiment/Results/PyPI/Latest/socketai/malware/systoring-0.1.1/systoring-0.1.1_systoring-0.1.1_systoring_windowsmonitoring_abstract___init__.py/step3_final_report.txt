{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module interface, importing AbstractSender from a local sender module and exposing it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports and declares exports without runtime data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module pattern that imports a class and exposes it via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety. The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a straightforward module interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
