  "purpose": "This code exports an AbstractSender class from the sender module, likely as part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "Imports AbstractSender from a local sender module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The import statement is the only flow; it imports a class from another module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed. The code appears to be standard package structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement and an __all__ declaration. It suggests module exports, which is typical in Python packages. No user input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets are present. The import is local, which is standard for package organization. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module export statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected. It appears to be a normal part of a Python package's structure.",
