  "purpose": "This code defines an export of the 'AbstractSender' class from the sender module, likely to be used as an interface or abstract class for sending functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender import AbstractSender",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points present",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data pathways identified",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal and straightforward, no anomalies or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class called AbstractSender from a relative module sender, and explicitly declares it as part of the module's public API with __all__. There is no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no data handling, and no network or I/O operations. It appears to be a simple module export statement with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign module export statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
