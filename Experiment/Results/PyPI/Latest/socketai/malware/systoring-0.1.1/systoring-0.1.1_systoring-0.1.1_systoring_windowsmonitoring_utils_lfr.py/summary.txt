  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code possesses high malicious potential due to its ability to silently download and execute arbitrary files without validation, making it highly risky in untrusted environments. The use of `shell=True` and hidden execution amplifies attack surface. Overall, it warrants a malware score of 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.8."
