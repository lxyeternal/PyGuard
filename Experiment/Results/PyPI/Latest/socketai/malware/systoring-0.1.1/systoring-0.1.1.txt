The assigned scores are appropriate, with a moderate security risk score (~0.5) reflecting the potential for misuse of the SSL bypass. Proper handling and restrictions on the use of _create_unverified_https() are recommended to mitigate security risks."

The behavior is characteristic of malware anti-debugging techniques but is not malicious on its own. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.2-0.3)."

The use of `shell=True` and hidden execution amplifies attack surface. Overall, it warrants a malware score of 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.8."
