  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate framework component with a notable security concern related to the SSL verification bypass method. No active malware or obfuscation is present. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a moderate security risk score (~0.5) reflecting the potential for misuse of the SSL bypass. Proper handling and restrictions on the use of _create_unverified_https() are recommended to mitigate security risks."
