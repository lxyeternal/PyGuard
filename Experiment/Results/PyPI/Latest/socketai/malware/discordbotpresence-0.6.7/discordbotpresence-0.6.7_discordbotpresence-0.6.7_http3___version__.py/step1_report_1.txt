  "sources": "Assignments to __title__, __description__, and __version__ variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output functions",
  "flows": "Simple data assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code only sets package metadata variables with static string values. There are no inputs, no external data processing, and no code execution or network activity. The structure is straightforward and conventional for package metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only static variable assignments for package metadata. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be a standard, benign package descriptor.",
