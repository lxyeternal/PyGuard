  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is only metadata assignment with no suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple assignment of package metadata variables: title, description, and version. There are no input operations, no data processing, no network operations, or dynamic code execution. The snippet appears to be part of a setup or package metadata file with standard variables. No malicious behavior or suspicious constructs are detected. Since this is only metadata, the likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only package metadata definitions with no signs of malicious behavior. It is standard and benign.",
