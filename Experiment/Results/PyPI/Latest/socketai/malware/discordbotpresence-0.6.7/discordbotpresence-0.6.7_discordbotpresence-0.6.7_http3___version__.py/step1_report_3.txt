  "flows": "None; no data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward metadata assignment without unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string literals to variables representing package metadata such as title, description, and version. There are no functions, no input/output operations, and no external data sources or sinks. The simplicity indicates standard package setup information without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata for the package and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and typical for Python package definitions.",
