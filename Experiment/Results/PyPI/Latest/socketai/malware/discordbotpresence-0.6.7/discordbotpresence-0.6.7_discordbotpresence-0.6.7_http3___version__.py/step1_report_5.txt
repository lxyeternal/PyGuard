  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'http3' Python library, including title, description, and version.",
  "sources": "The code defines string variables at the beginning of the module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is evident in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment only sets package metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __version__). It contains no logic, external data input, or code execution. The content appears to be standard package metadata declaration typical in Python modules. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious activity, or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward declaration of package metadata with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is typical for Python package setup or module files.",
