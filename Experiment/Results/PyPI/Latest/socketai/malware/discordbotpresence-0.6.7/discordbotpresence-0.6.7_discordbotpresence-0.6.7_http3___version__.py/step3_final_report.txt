  "purpose": "Static package metadata declarations (__title__, __description__, __version__) for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static string values to variables; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. Malware scores are appropriately 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risk scores are at or near 0. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package metadata with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All reports and scores accurately reflect this, and no further action is necessary.",
