  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports describe the code as simple variable assignments for package metadata (__title__, __description__, __version__).\n   - There are no functions, input/output operations, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - Given the code is purely static metadata, the likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The security risk scores are also minimal (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Scores**:\n   - The malware scores are appropriately set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n   - The security risk scores are very low, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Any Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports?**:\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as benign and metadata-only.\n   - No overestimation of risk or suspicion is evident.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly focuses on static code.\n\n5. **Recommendations for Score Adjustments**:\n   - The scores seem appropriate; there's no need to raise or lower them.\n   - The security risk score of 0.1 in report 2 could be considered slightly cautious but still reasonable given the context.\n\n6. **Overall Summary**:\n   - The code is a standard package metadata declaration.\n   - No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Final Justification and Personal Score Estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk in static metadata)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scoring appropriately reflects that. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is purely static metadata assignment.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.",
