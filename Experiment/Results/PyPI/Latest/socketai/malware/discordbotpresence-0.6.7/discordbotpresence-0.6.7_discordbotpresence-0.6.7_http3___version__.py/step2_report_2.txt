  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports describe the code as simple variable assignments for package metadata: setting `__title__`, `__description__`, and `__version__` to static string values. There are no functions, no data processing, no external input, no network activity, and no code execution. This is consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**  \n- The code does not contain any suspicious constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns.  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Errors or Flaws in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.  \n- They correctly conclude that this is standard package metadata, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- The only minor point is that one report assigns a security risk score of 0.1, which might be slightly overcautious given the benign nature of the code, but it's still reasonable as a conservative estimate.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct since there's no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0 is justified. The 0.1 score is slightly cautious but acceptable.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions and Consistency**  \n- The reports do not assume any malicious behavior; they are consistent with the code.  \n- The scores align with the analysis, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation and Personal Estimate**  \n- The code is a typical package metadata snippet, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.  \n- The high confidence scores (all 1) are justified.  \n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.  \n- The risk score should be 0, given the lack of any potential security concern.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is standard, benign package metadata.",
