{
  "purpose": "This code constructs multipart form-data payloads for HTTP requests, allowing for the inclusion of form fields and files.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from 'data' and 'files' dictionaries provided to 'multipart_encode', as well as reading file contents via file.read().",
  "sinks": "The code writes to a BytesIO stream and generates HTTP headers and body data; no direct sink for untrusted data outside local processing.",
  "flows": "Data from input dictionaries flows into Field objects (DataField or FileField), which then generate headers and data chunks. These are written into the body stream and combined with a boundary to produce the payload.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code handles data and files in a typical manner for multipart encoding. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically encodes form data and files for HTTP multipart requests. It generates boundary strings securely using os.urandom, encodes headers with proper quoting, and reads file contents safely. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious side effects. The use of mimetypes.guess_type is standard, and no user input is executed as code. The data is processed and stored locally in memory before transmission, with no network connections or data exfiltration present within this code segment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard multipart form-data encoding, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility for preparing HTTP payloads.",
