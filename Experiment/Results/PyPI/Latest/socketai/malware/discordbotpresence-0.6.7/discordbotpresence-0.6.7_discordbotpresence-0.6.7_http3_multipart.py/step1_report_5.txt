{
  "purpose": "This code constructs multipart/form-data payloads for HTTP requests, including handling file uploads and form data encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data: 'data' and 'files' dictionaries, which are used to generate the multipart body.",
  "sinks": "Generated multipart body bytes; the boundary and data are used in HTTP requests. No direct sink of untrusted data to system or network is present in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Data from 'data' and 'files' are used to generate form-data segments, written into a BytesIO object, and combined with boundary delimiters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of os.urandom for boundary is standard. The 'file.read()' method's content is directly included without validation or sanitization, but this is typical in multipart encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to model form fields (DataField and FileField) and functions to encode these fields into a multipart/form-data payload. The boundary is generated with os.urandom, then hexlified, which is a standard practice for boundary randomness. The data and files are iterated over, and their contents are written into a BytesIO object. No untrusted data handling that leads to command execution, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The file reading process simply reads file content; encoding is handled properly, with no apparent malicious manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard multipart/form-data encoder without any malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware-like activities are present. The code operates solely within its defined purpose of encoding form data for HTTP requests.",
