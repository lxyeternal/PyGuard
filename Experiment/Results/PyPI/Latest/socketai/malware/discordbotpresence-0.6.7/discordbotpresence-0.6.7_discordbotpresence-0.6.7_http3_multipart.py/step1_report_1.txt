{
  "purpose": "This code constructs multipart form-data for HTTP requests, allowing the upload of data and files.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'data' and 'files', which are dictionaries provided externally.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to an in-memory BytesIO object to generate the multipart payload. It also reads from file-like objects in 'files'.",
  "flows": "Data from 'data' and 'files' is transformed into multipart format: source (input data) -> rendering in multipart fields -> writing to BytesIO buffer -> output as bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code present. No evidence of malicious code or backdoors. Usage of os.urandom for boundary generation is standard for cryptographically secure randomness.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling form fields and files, including methods for rendering headers and data. The 'multipart_encode' function generates multipart data using secure random boundary bytes. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network communication are present. The code only deals with data formatting for HTTP POST requests, and it does not perform any network operations or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate multipart form-data generator, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard libraries and practices for safe data handling. No malware or malicious behaviors are detected.",
