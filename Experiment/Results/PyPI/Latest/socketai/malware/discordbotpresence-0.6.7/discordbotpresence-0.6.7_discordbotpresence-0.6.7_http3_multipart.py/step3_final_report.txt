{
  "purpose": "Constructs multipart/form-data payloads for HTTP requests, handling form fields and files.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'data' and 'files' dictionaries, reading file contents via 'file.read()'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only generates data for HTTP transmission, no external sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Data and file inputs flow into 'iter_fields', which generate 'Field' objects, then into 'multipart_encode' where data is written into a BytesIO buffer with boundary delimiters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard practices used. File content is read directly, which could be inefficient for large files but is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard multipart/form-data encoder using secure boundary generation with 'os.urandom'. It properly encodes headers and data, handles both text and file inputs, and constructs the payload with correct boundary delimiters. No malicious behaviors, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The only minor concern is reading entire files into memory without validation, but this is typical for such utilities and not malicious. The code is clear, straightforward, and adheres to best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of multipart/form-data encoding. It poses minimal security risks, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
