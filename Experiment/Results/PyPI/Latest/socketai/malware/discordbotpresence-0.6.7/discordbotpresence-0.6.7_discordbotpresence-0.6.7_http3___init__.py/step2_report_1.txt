  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The report correctly identifies that the code only contains import statements and no executable or data-processing logic.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound, emphasizing the absence of suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Given the lack of any suspicious activity, a risk score of 0.1 might be slightly high but still acceptable as a minimal concern. The malware score is correctly zero.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The report correctly notes that the code is just import statements with no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The risk score is zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is just imports, and the report correctly states this.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The analysis is thorough.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Fits the benign profile.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The import statements are standard.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Fits expectations.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is purely import statements.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign zero, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in the first report, which is acceptable given the minimal concern, but generally, the risk is very low or negligible.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\nGiven the nature of the code—simple import statements with no dynamic or executable content—the scores should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.05 if a very conservative approach is preferred)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with perhaps a slight reduction in the risk score to 0, since there's no evident security concern.",
