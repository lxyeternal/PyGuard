{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an import module, bringing in various components such as version info, API methods, client classes, configuration options, connection handling, exceptions, data models, and status codes for an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, including version info, API functions, client classes, configuration constants, connection classes, exception classes, data models, and status codes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no runtime data flows; the code only performs static imports without dynamic execution or data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements typical for a package's initialization. It does not contain executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify this as benign. Malware scores are zero, reflecting no malicious intent. Security risk scores are minimal (0 or 0.1), appropriate for such static module setup. The code's structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The high confidence in benign nature is justified by the absence of suspicious patterns or dynamic code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import module with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the content. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
