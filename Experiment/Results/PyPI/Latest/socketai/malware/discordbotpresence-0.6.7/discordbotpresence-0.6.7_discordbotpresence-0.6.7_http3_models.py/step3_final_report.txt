{
  "purpose": "Provides URL parsing, request/response handling, headers, cookies, and async support for an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "URL strings, request data, headers, cookies, JSON payloads, response content.",
  "sinks": "Response content decoding via json() and text properties; cookie extraction and setting; header management.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs into request objects, encoding data, managing cookies, and decoding responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive, standard HTTP client implementation utilizing common libraries and patterns. It handles URL normalization, request preparation, headers, cookies, and response decoding securely. No malicious behaviors, network exfiltration, or sabotage are evident. The use of standard modules and absence of obfuscation or suspicious network calls support its legitimacy. Response content exposure via properties is typical and not inherently malicious, though it warrants cautious use. The cookie management aligns with standard practices, and async handling appears correct. Overall, the code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP client library with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. It presents a low security risk and no supply chain concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1–0.2) are accurate and justified.",
