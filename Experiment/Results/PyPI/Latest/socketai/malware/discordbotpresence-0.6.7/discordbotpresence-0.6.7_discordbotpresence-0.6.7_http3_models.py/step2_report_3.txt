  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details of the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is a standard HTTP client framework with no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. It notes the absence of hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or hidden payloads.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** Given the code's structure—URL parsing, request/response handling, cookie management, and encoding/decoding—there's no evidence of malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) seems appropriate, reflecting standard code with some complexity but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard HTTP client design, proper handling of URL, headers, cookies, and response content. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable. The code's complexity does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is a legitimate HTTP client framework, with proper management of URL parsing, headers, cookies, and response decoding. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** Consistent with previous assessments; the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Also concludes the code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client component, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The code's design and functionality do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, highlighting standard practices, no suspicious code, and secure handling of data.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Justification:** The consistent low scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code contains no malicious payloads, network calls to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. The code is a typical HTTP client implementation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which aligns with the code's nature. It handles sensitive data (headers, cookies, response content), but nothing indicates an immediate security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No evidence of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to handling of potentially sensitive data, but overall low.\n\n**Additional notes:** The code does not perform any network connections or data exfiltration on its own; it provides infrastructure for HTTP communication. No signs of supply chain compromise are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**              | **0.2**   |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the security best practices for such code.",
