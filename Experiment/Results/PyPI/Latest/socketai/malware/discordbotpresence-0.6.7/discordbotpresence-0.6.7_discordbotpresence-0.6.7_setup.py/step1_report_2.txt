{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, specifically configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from '__version__.py' for version info, 'README.md' for description, and filesystem for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data from untrusted sources is used in a way that affects execution or leaks data.",
  "flows": "File reads (version, README) -> package setup configuration; no external data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code constructs; standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python and setuptools methods to gather package info and configure installation parameters. It reads version info from a file, loads a README for description, and discovers packages. No dynamic execution, no external data sources that could be malicious, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The functions are straightforward and intended for packaging, with no apparent malicious intent or malicious code embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script used for packaging and does not contain malware or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
