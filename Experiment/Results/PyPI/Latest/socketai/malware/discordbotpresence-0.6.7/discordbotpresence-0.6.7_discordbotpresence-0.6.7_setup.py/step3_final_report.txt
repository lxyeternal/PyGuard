{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project, defining package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py', long description from 'README.md', and package directories via os.walk.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks; static files are read without user input.",
  "flows": "Static file reads and package discovery without dynamic or external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading static files, extracting version info with regex, discovering packages via os.walk, and defining dependencies. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The code is straightforward and follows common practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe package configuration.",
