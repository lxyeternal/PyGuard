  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are identified.\n- The code reads static files (__version__.py, README.md, LICENSE.md) and uses standard practices.\n- The version is retrieved via regex from __version__.py; assuming the file exists and is well-formed, this is typical.\n- No external or untrusted data sources are involved during setup.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or code injection present.\n- Dependencies are typical for such projects.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n- **Data leaks or sensitive info:** None.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n\n### Scores:\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the script is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Justifications for scores:\n- The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score of 0; code is straightforward.\n- Security risk score of 0; no vulnerabilities or exploits are evident.\n- Confidence of 1.0; all reports agree on benign nature.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only minor point is the hardcoded author email, but this is not malicious, just a standard author contact.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or security concerns.",
