{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'discordbotpresence' to manage package metadata, dependencies, and installation details.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from '__version__.py' file, reads README.md for long description, reads package directories for sub-packages, and reads LICENSE.md for data files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (version, description, package list, license) into setup configuration; no external data flow or network interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The version retrieval from '__version__.py' relies on a standard regex, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for Python packaging, importing standard modules, defining helper functions to read version info, description, and packages. The setup() call uses these helpers to configure the package metadata. No external input, no dynamic code execution, no malicious behavior. It reads static files and sets up dependencies. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks detected.",
