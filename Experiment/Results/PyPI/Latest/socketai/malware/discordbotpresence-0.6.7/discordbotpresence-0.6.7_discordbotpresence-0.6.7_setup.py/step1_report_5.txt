{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'discordbotpresence', intended to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from '__version__.py', reading the README.md for long description, gathering package directories via os.walk, and reading the LICENSE.md file from data_files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted input; all data sources are static files or hardcoded strings.",
  "flows": "Read version from '__version__.py' -> used in setup version; read README.md -> used as long description; collect packages -> for packaging; read LICENSE.md -> data_files for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed; standard setup script with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup procedures for a Python package, including reading package metadata, dependencies, and package structure. The functions are straightforward and rely on static files or standard library modules. The version retrieval function reads a file to extract version info, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious logic detected. The package dependencies are explicit and seem appropriate for a web-related package. No signs of malicious or sabotage code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It correctly reads static files, gathers package data, and prepares the package for distribution without any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
