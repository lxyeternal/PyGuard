{
  "purpose": "Provides content decoding for HTTP content-encodings including identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli, with support for multiple encodings and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data bytes in decode methods; imports brotli module if available.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; processes data in memory without external data leaks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from decode() methods through respective decompressors; optional brotli import affects supported decoders.",
  "anomalies": "Assertion in BrotliDecoder to ensure brotli library presence; optional dependency handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard content decoding classes with proper error handling and optional brotli support. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The optional import and assertion are typical dependency checks. No data leaks, code injection, or obfuscation are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) align with the code's straightforward, safe utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe implementation of content decoders with no malicious or security issues. The minimal risk score reflects dependency handling but does not indicate any threat.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
