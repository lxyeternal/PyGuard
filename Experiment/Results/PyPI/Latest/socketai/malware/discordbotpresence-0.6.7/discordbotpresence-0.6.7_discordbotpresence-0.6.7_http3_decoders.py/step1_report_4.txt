{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of classes for decoding content-encoded data such as identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli, supporting multiple layered decodings.",
  "sources": "The code reads external modules (`zlib`, `brotli`, and local exception `DecodingError`). It also potentially reads input data via the `decode` methods called on instances of the decoder classes.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the `decode` methods which process data passed to them. No direct data leakage or external system interaction occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the `decode` method of a decoder instance, potentially through multiple layers in `MultiDecoder`. Data may be processed and returned after decompression.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code properly handles optional dependencies (`brotli`) with assertions and checks. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various decoder classes for different content encodings, using standard libraries and a third-party library (`brotli`). Exception handling is appropriate, raising custom `DecodingError` on errors. The optional `brotli` dependency is managed correctly, with fallback behavior. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no external data leaks, or malicious behavior. The overall structure is typical for a content decoding utility module. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious code features identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard content decoding functionality with proper dependency management and error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
