{
  "purpose": "This code provides content decoding functionality for HTTP responses, supporting multiple compression algorithms such as identity, gzip, deflate, and optionally brotli.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements, including optional 'brotli' library, and uses class constructors and methods to instantiate decoders and process data.",
  "sinks": "The decode and flush methods process data streams which could potentially handle untrusted or maliciously crafted data, but there are no direct sinks such as network transmission or data exfiltration in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the decode methods of various Decoder subclasses through multiple decoder layers (for MultiDecoder), but there are no external sinks or data leaks implemented within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard decompression tasks and uses assertions for optional dependencies. The only notable point is the assertion in BrotliDecoder that requires brotli to be installed, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of Decoder classes for handling different compression formats, with error handling that raises custom DecodingError on failure. The optional import of 'brotli' is handled gracefully. The implementation uses standard libraries (zlib) and a known third-party library (brotli). No data leakage, insecure data handling, or suspicious behavior is evident. The decoders process data streams with no side effects such as network activity or system modifications. The SUPPORTED_DECODERS dictionary maps encoding names to decoder classes, and dynamically removes 'br' if the brotli library isn't available.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of HTTP content decoding mechanisms with proper error handling and optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this module.",
