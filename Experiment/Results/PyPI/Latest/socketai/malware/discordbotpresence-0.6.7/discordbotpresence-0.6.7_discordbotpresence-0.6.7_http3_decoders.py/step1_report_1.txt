{
  "purpose": "The code provides various decoders for handling content encoding such as identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli, facilitating decoding of HTTP content-encoded data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external sources via the decode methods, which process byte streams. No explicit external input sources like user input or environment variables are present.",
  "sinks": "The decode and flush methods process data, but do not directly write to external systems or leak data. No data is sent over network, written to files, or stored insecurely within this module.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the decode methods through the decoder chain, ultimately returning decoded data. There are no external sinks or data exfiltration points present.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs dynamic library loading with an assertion to ensure 'brotli' is installed before use. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The only assertion is to verify brotli availability.",
  "analysis": "The module defines multiple decoders for different compression algorithms, utilizing standard libraries (zlib, brotli). It includes error handling for decoding issues, raising DecodingError exceptions. The code respects typical usage patterns for decoding streams and does not contain code injection, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The optional import of 'brotli' is handled gracefully, with a check and removal from supported decoders if unavailable. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate function without suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for decoding content-encoded data streams, with proper error handling and library checks. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. No indicators of supply chain sabotage or malware are present.",
