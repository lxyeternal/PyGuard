{
  "purpose": "This code provides various classes for decoding content encodings such as identity, deflate, gzip, brotli, and multi-encoding in HTTP communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules (typing, zlib, brotli, exceptions), and potentially user-provided data in the decode methods.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data may be used downstream for further processing or output, but no explicit sinks are present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the decode methods of each Decoder class, processed sequentially through the decode calls in MultiDecoder, ultimately outputting decoded bytes.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward, with standard decoding logic. The assert in BrotliDecoder enforces brotli library presence, no unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present. No suspicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of Decoder classes for handling different content encodings, including identity (no-op), deflate, gzip, brotli, and a composite decoder for multiple layers. The import of brotli is optional and checked at runtime, with conditional removal from supported decoders if not available. Exception handling is appropriate, wrapping zlib and brotli errors into a custom DecodingError. The implementation relies on well-known libraries for decoding, with no suspicious patterns or external calls that could be malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or privacy violations are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of content decoding with support for multiple compression formats, including optional brotli support, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of decoding classes for HTTP content encoding, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs expected operations safely using standard libraries, and no malicious behavior is detected.",
