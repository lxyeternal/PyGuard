  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues, claims, and scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code provides legitimate decoders, employs standard libraries, handles errors properly, and has no malicious behaviors. The confidence is high (0.9), malware score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n- **Assessment:** The code indeed appears to be a standard implementation of content decoders, with no signs of malicious activity. The assertion for brotli is a typical pattern, and the optional import is handled gracefully. No suspicious patterns or data leaks are present.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing proper handling of optional dependencies, standard libraries, and no malicious behavior. Confidence is very high (0.95), malware score is 0, security risk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code's content. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard nature of the implementation, with proper error handling and optional brotli support. Confidence is perfect (1), malware is 0, security risk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code remains a straightforward decoder implementation, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard decoder suite, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. Confidence is high (1), malware is 0, security risk is 0.1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The optional brotli dependency is managed correctly, and no malicious patterns are present.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a well-structured decoder set, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. Confidence is 1, malware is 0, security risk is 0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis matches the code's straightforward implementation.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's content. No malicious behaviors, code injection, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The highest assigned is 0.1, which is reasonable considering the code's purpose. Since the code processes potentially untrusted data, a minimal security risk score is justified, but no significant vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal risk due to processing untrusted data streams, but no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent with the code's nature. The scores are justified and do not require adjustments.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the assessments in the reports and the actual code review.",
