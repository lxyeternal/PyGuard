{
  "purpose": "This code provides various decoders for handling content encoding types such as identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli, allowing decoding of compressed HTTP content.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data in the decode methods of each decoder class, processing compressed bytes.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data is returned by decode methods; no external sinks are present, but data may be used downstream in the application.",
  "flows": "Input bytes pass into decoder.decode() methods, which process and return decompressed data; the MultiDecoder applies multiple decoders in sequence.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious or unusual code patterns. Assertion for brotli availability is standard, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several decoder classes for handling content encodings used in HTTP communications. Each decoder uses well-known libraries (zlib, brotli) with proper exception handling. The brotli decoder asserts the presence of the brotli library but only when needed, and dynamically removes 'br' from supported decoders if unavailable. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of third-party libraries is appropriate and standard. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of content decoding mechanisms with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard decompression tasks in a safe manner.",
