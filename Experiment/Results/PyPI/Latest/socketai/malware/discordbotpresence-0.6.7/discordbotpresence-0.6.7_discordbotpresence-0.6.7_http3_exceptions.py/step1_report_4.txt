  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various timeout, HTTP, redirect, stream, and other errors in network operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exceptions; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; exceptions are only class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this is solely exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of class definitions for various exception types related to network operations, timeouts, HTTP errors, redirects, and streaming errors. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The classes are straightforward and only inherit from built-in exception classes, serving as custom error types. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining exception classes for network-related errors. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. No vulnerabilities or malicious signals are detected.",
