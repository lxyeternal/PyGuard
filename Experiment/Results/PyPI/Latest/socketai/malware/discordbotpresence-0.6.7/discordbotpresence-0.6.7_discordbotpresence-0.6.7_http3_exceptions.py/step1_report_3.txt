{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various timeout, HTTP, redirect, stream, and other errors in an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions, no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output occurs within these classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; these are static class definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of exception class declarations with descriptive docstrings; no suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured hierarchy of custom exceptions to handle timeout scenarios, HTTP errors, redirect issues, stream errors, and other network-related errors in an HTTP context. All classes are standard Python exception subclasses with descriptive docstrings, serving as error identifiers. There are no embedded malicious behaviors, data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The design is typical for an error handling module within an HTTP client library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes intended for error handling in an HTTP client context. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The implementation appears standard and benign.",
