{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors and timeouts related to HTTP operations and streaming in a network communication context.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings within the code, which describe exception handling mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks or data leaks; the code only defines exception classes without executing data processing.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely consists of class declarations for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured set of custom exception classes for handling different timeout, HTTP, redirect, stream, and other errors. All classes inherit from built-in Exception or other relevant base classes, with descriptive docstrings. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are evident. The purpose appears to be standard error categorization for a network library. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of exception class definitions used for network communication error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
