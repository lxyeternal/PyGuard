{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various timeout, HTTP, redirect, stream, and other error conditions in an HTTP client or network-related library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all exception classes are predefined and do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leakage.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; these are solely exception class definitions used for control flow in other code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists of standard exception class declarations with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive set of custom exception classes for network and HTTP error handling, including timeout types, HTTP errors, redirect errors, stream errors, and miscellaneous exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. The classes serve as structured error handling constructs typical of network libraries. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and does not include any external calls, data leaks, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of exception class definitions intended for use in a network or HTTP client library. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured error handling code.",
