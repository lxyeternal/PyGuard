{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling network, HTTP, redirect, stream, and miscellaneous errors in a network or HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from built-in exceptions; no external data input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static class hierarchy without data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling in network operations. All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, with clear documentation. No executable logic, data processing, or external calls are present. The structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as a foundation for error categorization. The absence of data flows, sinks, or external interactions indicates a benign, non-malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes for network error handling, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The provided reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores.",
