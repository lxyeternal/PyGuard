  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward set of custom exception classes for network, HTTP, redirect, stream, and timeout errors.\n- No external data processing, data leaks, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The classes are standard, inherit from built-in exceptions, and contain descriptive docstrings.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The purpose is purely to serve as structured error handling in an HTTP or network library.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- Security risk scores are 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n- The confidence scores are high (1), which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely exception class definitions, there are no data flows, sinks, or sources that could be exploited.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted; the code appears to be standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The provided scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The risk scores should remain low, given the benign and standard design.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly zero.\n- The overall security assessment aligns with the detailed analysis.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as the code is purely structural and error handling, but a tiny margin for any unforeseen context)\n\nThis review confirms that the code is benign, with no malicious or security concern signals.",
