  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to HTTP connections, timeouts, redirects, streaming errors, and other request-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read in this code; only class definitions and docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present; this code only defines exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; this is purely structural exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors observed; the code is straightforward and descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes for handling various HTTP and streaming errors, timeouts, and other related issues. All classes inherit from built-in exception types or base classes, with descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The classes are standard for robust HTTP handling and do not perform any data manipulation or network activity themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured collection of exception classes for an HTTP client or library, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural and does not contain any harmful or suspicious behaviors.",
