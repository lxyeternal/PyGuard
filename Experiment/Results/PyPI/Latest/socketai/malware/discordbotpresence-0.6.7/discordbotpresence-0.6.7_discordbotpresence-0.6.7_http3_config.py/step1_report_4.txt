{
  "purpose": "This code provides configuration and utility classes for managing SSL/TLS settings, timeouts, and connection pool limits for HTTP client operations, with a focus on secure connections.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __version__, reads CA bundle path via certifi.where(), accesses environment variables via os.path, uses asyncio.get_event_loop().",
  "sinks": "SSL context creation and configuration, loading certificate chains, setting SSL options, and protocol settings.",
  "flows": "SSLConfig.load_ssl_context() calls load_ssl_context_verify() or load_ssl_context_no_verify() based on verify flag, which loads verify locations and certs; TimeoutConfig and PoolLimits store configuration parameters; load_ssl_context_verify() loads CA bundles and certs based on provided paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network calls are present. The code uses standard SSL/TLS configuration practices. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration classes for SSL, timeouts, and connection pooling, focusing on secure default settings and proper certificate handling. It correctly separates verified and unverified SSL contexts, uses certifi for CA bundles, and allows user-provided certificate files. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. All data access points are legitimate configuration parameters and environment access. The logic appears standard and secure for a typical HTTP client setup. No anomalies indicating malicious intent or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-implemented configuration module for managing secure HTTP connections. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security posture is appropriate for a dependency intended to configure SSL and connection parameters.",
