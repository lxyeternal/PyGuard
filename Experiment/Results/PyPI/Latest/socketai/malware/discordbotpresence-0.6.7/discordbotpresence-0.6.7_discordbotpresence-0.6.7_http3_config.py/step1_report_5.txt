{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration classes and constants for handling SSL/TLS, timeouts, and connection pooling in an HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Reads version information (__version__), environment variables (via os.path), and certifi's CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "Uses ssl functions for SSL context creation, loads certificates, and verifies CA bundles; potential for misconfigured SSL contexts.",
  "flows": "Configuration inputs (certificates, verify flags) flow into SSL context creation and verification setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; SSL/TLS settings follow standard security practices; no unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily configuration and setup for secure HTTP connections, with careful handling of SSL contexts and timeouts. It includes standard security practices like disabling SSLv2/SSLv3, setting cipher suites, and verifying certificates. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic observed. It properly handles loading certificates and CA bundles from specified paths. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior present. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical secure configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured configuration module for SSL, timeouts, and connection pooling in a Python HTTP client. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
