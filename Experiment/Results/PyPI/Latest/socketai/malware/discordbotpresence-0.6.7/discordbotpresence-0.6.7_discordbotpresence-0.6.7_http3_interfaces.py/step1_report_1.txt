{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract base classes and interfaces for asynchronous and synchronous request dispatching, stream reading/writing, connection pooling, and concurrency management. Serves as a foundational module for HTTP client implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.config, .models), standard libraries (enum, ssl, typing, types.TracebackType), and internal class methods and constructors that initialize or process request data.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data directly leading to vulnerabilities or data leaks. The methods are mostly placeholders raising NotImplementedError, with no suspicious data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request creation in request methods to send/execute methods, which are not implemented here, so no specific data flow to external sinks is observable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be purely structural, defining interfaces and base classes. There are no obfuscated patterns or dynamic code execution. No external network connections or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly contains class definitions for request dispatchers, stream readers/writers, semaphores, and concurrency backends, all of which are abstract with NotImplementedError. It does not perform any actual data processing, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. It appears to be a standard foundational module with no malicious intent or security risks, only scaffolding for future implementations. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of abstract base classes and interfaces for HTTP request handling and concurrency control. It contains no active or executable logic, no data leaks, no network connections, and no malicious or suspicious code. Overall, it is benign and serves as a structural foundation for other modules.",
