{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and interfaces for asynchronous and synchronous HTTP request dispatching, stream reading/writing, connection pooling, and background task management.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from method parameters, class instantiations, and method calls. No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data that could lead to data leakage or malicious execution. The code does not perform network I/O, data storage, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Method parameters (e.g., method, url, data, headers) pass data within request objects; these are used internally but do not flow into external sinks. No evidence of data flows to untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely boilerplate, with placeholder methods raising NotImplementedError. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base classes for dispatchers, stream readers/writers, connection pools, and background managers, with no concrete implementations. No input validation, network operations, or data processing occurs here. The code structure is typical for modular library setup, with no signs of malicious intent. The absence of actual implementation logic minimizes risk. No suspicious or malicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module serves as a foundation for HTTP client architecture, establishing interfaces without concrete logic. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for legitimate use as part of a larger library.",
