{
  "purpose": "Define abstract base classes and interfaces for HTTP request dispatching, stream reading/writing, connection pooling, and concurrency management, serving as a foundational framework component.",
  "sources": "None; all methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError, with no data input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; methods are unimplemented and do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of implementation, no active logic, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of abstract classes and interfaces intended for extension. It lacks active logic, data processing, network connections, or data leaks. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature and structural role are evident, with all methods raising NotImplementedError and no data flows or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, foundational scaffold for an HTTP client library, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk and malware scores are appropriate, reflecting its role as a non-executable interface layer.",
