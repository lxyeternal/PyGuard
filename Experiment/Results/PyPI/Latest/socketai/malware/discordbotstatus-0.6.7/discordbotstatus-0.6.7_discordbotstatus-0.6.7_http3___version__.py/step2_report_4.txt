  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata (__title__, __description__, __version__).\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external data input/output, or code execution.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Assessment:**\n   - Given the simplicity of the code, there are no logical flaws or vulnerabilities.\n   - The absence of any data handling, external calls, or dynamic code indicates no security risks.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign, metadata-only, with high confidence (confidence: 1).\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is detected or suggested.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Issues:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious behavior or assigns an unjustified risk score.\n   - The high confidence (1) across all reports is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - Based on the provided code snippet and reports, the assessment of zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk is accurate.\n   - No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is purely metadata with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate, and the scores are justified.",
