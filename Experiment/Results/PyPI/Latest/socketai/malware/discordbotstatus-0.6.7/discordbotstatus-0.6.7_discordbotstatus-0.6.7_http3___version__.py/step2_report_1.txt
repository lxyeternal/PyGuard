  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely variable assignments for package metadata (__title__, __description__, __version__).\n   - There are no functions, data flows, input/output operations, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code snippet is straightforward and benign.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment that this is harmless metadata.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty in their assessment.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Flaws**:\n   - Since the code is trivial, there's no basis for raising the risk scores.\n   - No report claims or implies any malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation**:\n   - The code appears to be standard package metadata declarations.\n   - No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores are justified at 1.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are correct.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, with no security concerns.",
