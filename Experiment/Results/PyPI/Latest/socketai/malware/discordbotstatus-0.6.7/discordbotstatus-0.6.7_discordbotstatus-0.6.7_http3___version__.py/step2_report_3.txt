  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\nThe provided code only assigns static string values to variables (__title__, __description__, __version__). There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. It is purely package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is just metadata with no suspicious behavior. This is accurate.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  The reports are consistent and correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Scores given:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or 0.5. Since the code is trivial metadata, these scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n**1. Malware score:**  \n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or external communications.  \n- **Score should be 0.**  \n- The reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n\n**2. Obfuscated score:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n- **Score should be 0.**  \n- The reports correctly assign obfuscated score as 0.\n\n**3. Security risk score:**  \n- Since the code is just metadata, there is no security risk.  \n- **Score should be 0.**  \n- The reports' scores align with this.\n\n**4. Reasoning about the purpose:**  \n- All reports recognize that this is just package metadata. No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond that.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is legitimate package metadata with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, and the scoring reflects that.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe entire set of reports correctly identifies the code as benign metadata with no security concerns. No changes or corrections are necessary.",
