  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that could leak data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist, as the code only assigns string literals to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and only contains package metadata. No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata variables (__title__, __description__, __version__). There are no functions, data input, output, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be standard package metadata declaration.",
