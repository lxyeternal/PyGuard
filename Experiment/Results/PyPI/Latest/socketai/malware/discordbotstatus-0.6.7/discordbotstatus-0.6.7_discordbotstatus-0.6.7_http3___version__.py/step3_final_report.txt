  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, external calls, or dynamic behaviors.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward variable assignments with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no functions, data processing, external data reads, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is simple, clear, and free of obfuscation or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this as benign metadata with no security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, with high confidence (1), reflecting the code's harmless nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely package metadata with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
