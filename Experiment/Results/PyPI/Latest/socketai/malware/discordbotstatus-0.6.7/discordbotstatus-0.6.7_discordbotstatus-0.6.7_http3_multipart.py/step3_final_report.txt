{
  "purpose": "This code constructs multipart/form-data payloads for HTTP requests, supporting both data fields and file uploads.",
  "sources": "Input data from provided dictionaries (data and files), reading file content via file.read().",
  "sinks": "Rendered header bytes and data bytes sent over network or written to storage; no external sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data and files are processed into Field objects, which generate headers and data; these are written sequentially into the BytesIO buffer, forming the multipart payload.",
  "anomalies": "Potential mishandling of binary files due to encoding file content as UTF-8 if it's a string, which could corrupt binary data but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard multipart/form-data encoder with classes for data and file fields. Boundary generation uses os.urandom() and hexlify(), which is secure. File content is read and conditionally encoded as UTF-8, which may mishandle binary files but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The overall structure is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, secure implementation for encoding multipart/form-data payloads. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Minor concern exists regarding binary data handling, but it does not constitute a security threat.",
