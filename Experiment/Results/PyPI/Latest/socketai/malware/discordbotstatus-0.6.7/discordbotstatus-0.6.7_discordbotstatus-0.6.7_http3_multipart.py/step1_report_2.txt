{
  "purpose": "This code constructs multipart/form-data HTTP request bodies, handling form fields and file uploads.",
  "sources": "User-provided data via the 'data' and 'files' dictionaries passed to 'multipart_encode'. File objects read content via their 'read()' method.",
  "sinks": "Data written to the BytesIO object for HTTP request body; file content is read and embedded into the request payload.",
  "flows": "Data from user input flows into 'DataField' or 'FileField' objects, which then generate headers and data segments, ultimately assembled into the HTTP request body.",
  "anomalies": "The code reads file content with 'file.read()' and encodes it as UTF-8 if it's a string, which could lead to mishandling binary data. The boundary is generated using 'os.urandom' and hexlify, which is generally safe. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. No external network activity or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates multipart form data by iterating over user input 'data' and 'files'. It generates unique boundaries with 'os.urandom' and hexlify, then assembles headers and content for each field. The file reading process could mishandle binary data if the file content is not bytes or string, but no malicious code or external data exfiltration methods are evident. No suspicious external calls, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present. The overall structure appears standard for form-data encoding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard multipart/form-data encoder with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It properly constructs HTTP request bodies for form submissions. No malware or security risks are detected.",
