  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues detected; code is standard multipart/form-data encoder.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — all reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no vulnerabilities. The high confidence (0.95) aligns with the thorough analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues detected; standard multipart encoding.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Noted that reading file content with `file.read()` and encoding as UTF-8 could mishandle binary data, but this is a common issue rather than malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 — the slightly elevated risk score accounts for potential mishandling of binary data, not malicious intent.\n- **Justification:** No malware or malicious activity, but the potential mishandling of binary data justifies a small security concern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; standard implementation.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; boundary generation and data handling are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — appropriate for a standard utility.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; low security risk.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; typical multipart encoding.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious activity; use of `os.urandom()` is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues; straightforward multipart form data construction.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; standard practices used.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is purely for constructing multipart/form-data payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Generally very low (0 or 0.2), with minor concern about binary data handling, but nothing malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The code is a standard, secure implementation for encoding multipart form data.\n- The only minor concern is the handling of binary files as UTF-8 strings, which could be improved but does not constitute a security risk.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor concern about binary data handling, but overall very safe)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and appropriate for its purpose. No adjustments needed beyond noting the binary data handling caveat.",
