{
  "purpose": "Provides asyncio-based classes for network I/O, connection pooling, SSL handling, and background task management, including a documented SSL monkey patch for a known Python bug.",
  "sources": "asyncio.StreamReader, asyncio.StreamWriter, internal asyncio SSL transport classes, environment variables, external configuration modules",
  "sinks": "Data read from network streams, data written to network streams, internal asyncio SSL classes (via monkey patch), background tasks",
  "flows": "Input data flows from network streams through Reader/Writer classes; SSL monkey patch modifies internal asyncio SSL transport classes; background tasks are scheduled via event loop",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal asyncio classes in ssl_monkey_patch, global variable SSL_MONKEY_PATCH_APPLIED, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation, explicit timeout handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard asyncio utility layer for network communication, with classes for reading, writing, connection pooling, and background task management. The ssl_monkey_patch function addresses a known asyncio bug by monkey patching internal classes, which is a documented workaround. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code handles timeouts explicitly and manages event loops carefully. The security risk stems from internal asyncio class manipulation, but it is a known and documented fix, justifying a low risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured asyncio network utility module. The SSL monkey patch is a documented workaround for a known bug, not malicious. No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
