{
  "purpose": "Provide asynchronous stream reading/writing, connection pooling, and background task management for network protocols with timeout and SSL handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (asyncio, ssl, functools, typing, types) and local modules (.config, .exceptions, .interfaces); user-defined classes and functions; global variables.",
  "sinks": "Asyncio network connection functions (asyncio.open_connection, wait_for, create_task), stream_writer.write, stream_writer.drain, task.result() in BackgroundManager.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from network connections into stream_reader and stream_writer; timeout flags influence control flow; background manager creates tasks; connect method manages SSL details.",
  "anomalies": "Use of global variable SSL_MONKEY_PATCH_APPLIED for one-time SSL monkey patching; dynamic SSL context usage; no hardcoded secrets; no unusual or obfuscated code patterns; patching asyncio internal class for SSL bug fix.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for async network IO with timeout handling, connection pooling, and background task management. It performs SSL monkey patching for known Python bug, manages timeouts via flags, and handles event loops carefully. The connection method inspects SSL objects for ALPN/NPN protocols to select HTTP version. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code’s purpose aligns with normal async network operation patterns. The SSL patch and background task management are standard techniques for improving compatibility and asynchronous execution. No suspicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be well-structured, intended for asynchronous network protocol handling with timeout and SSL management. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks beyond typical connection handling. The code is legitimate and safe for use in its context.",
