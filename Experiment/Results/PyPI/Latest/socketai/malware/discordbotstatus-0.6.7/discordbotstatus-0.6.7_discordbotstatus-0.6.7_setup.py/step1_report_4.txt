  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'http3' Python package, primarily to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations: reading '__version__.py' and 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution points; standard package setup process.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from a file, reading README for long description, collecting package directories for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; code functions are typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading version info from a file, reading long description from README.md, collecting packages for installation, and defining dependencies. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected. The get_version function uses regex to parse a version string from a file, which is standard practice. Dependencies are explicitly listed with version constraints. No network activity or execution of untrusted code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional Python setup script with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risks. It serves the purpose of packaging the project for distribution safely.",
