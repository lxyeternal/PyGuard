  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project named 'discordbotstatus', which depends on the 'http3' package.",
  "sources": "Reading files: '__version__.py' for version info, 'README.md' for long description, and filesystem traversal for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "Reading files: '__version__.py' and 'README.md'. No untrusted data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Reading version information from '__version__.py' -> used in setup() for versioning; Reading README -> used for long description; Filesystem traversal -> package discovery.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup.py configuration for packaging a project. It reads version info from a local file, reads README content for description, discovers packages via filesystem traversal, and specifies dependencies. All operations involve reading static files or local directories, with no external data input or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script without any malicious or suspicious elements. It performs standard package setup procedures securely. No malware or security risks detected.",
