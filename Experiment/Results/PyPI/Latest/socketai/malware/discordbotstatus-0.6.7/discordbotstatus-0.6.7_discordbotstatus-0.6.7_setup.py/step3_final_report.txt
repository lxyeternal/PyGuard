  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a project, reading version info, README, discovering packages, and defining dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __version__.py, reads README.md, traverses directories for packages, and loads dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, no network activity, no code execution of untrusted input.",
  "flows": "File reads and directory traversal without external or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward setup code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup operations for a Python package. It reads version info with a regex, loads README content, discovers packages via os.walk, and specifies dependencies explicitly. No network activity, code injection, or malicious patterns are present. The regex assumes a standard format for __version__.py, which is common practice. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are detected. All operations are safe and standard for packaging scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup.py script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code does not exhibit any suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
