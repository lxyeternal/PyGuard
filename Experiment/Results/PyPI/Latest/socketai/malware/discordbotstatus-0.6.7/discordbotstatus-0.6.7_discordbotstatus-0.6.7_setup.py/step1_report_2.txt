  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project named 'discordbotstatus' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads files 'README.md' and '__version__.py' to extract long description and version information.",
  "sinks": "None of the data read from files or variables is used in a way that leads to execution of untrusted data or insecure operations.",
  "flows": "File contents are read and parsed, with version extracted via regex; no untrusted data is executed or sent over network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads package version information from a file using regex, loads a README for long description, and collects package directories. It then uses setuptools to configure package metadata and dependencies. No untrusted input handling, code injection, or network activity is present. The code adheres to common packaging practices and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code functions as intended for package configuration.",
