{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'discordbotstatus', used for packaging and distributing the module via setuptools.",
  "sources": "File reads from 'README.md' and '__version__.py' within the package directory; code execution is limited to file reading and package metadata collection.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code are present; the script only reads files and defines setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and long description from files, then passes data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. All operations are standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading version info and README content, discovering packages, and configuring package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The get_version function reads a version string from a file; get_long_description reads a README file; get_packages walks the directory tree to find packages. The setup() call uses this data to configure the package, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It simply reads package metadata and configures the build process.",
