  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various network, timeout, redirect, stream, and other HTTP-related errors.",
  "sources": "The code defines exception classes and does not read input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects the system or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard exception class definitions with no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured set of custom exceptions for handling network errors, timeouts, HTTP errors, redirects, streaming issues, and URL/cookie validation. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external calls. The classes serve as error types, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be a standard error handling module for a network-related Python library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in an HTTP/network context. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
