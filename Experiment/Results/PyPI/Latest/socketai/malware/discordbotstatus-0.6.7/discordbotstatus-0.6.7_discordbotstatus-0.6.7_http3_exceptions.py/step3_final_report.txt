{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling network, HTTP, redirect, stream, and miscellaneous errors in a network or HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only declares class definitions used as error indicators.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution beyond class declarations; no source-to-sink pathways exist.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of straightforward class definitions with no embedded logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of declarative exception classes for various network errors, timeouts, HTTP errors, redirects, streaming issues, and miscellaneous conditions. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign, standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception classes used for error handling in network-related libraries. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
