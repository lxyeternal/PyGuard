  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, content, and context of the code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as a set of custom exception classes for network, HTTP, redirect, stream, and related errors. They emphasize that the code is purely declarative, with no data processing, input handling, or execution of untrusted data. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and free of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code matches the descriptions: it only defines exception classes without any executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports correctly identify that these are exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All are assigned malware and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:**  \n  The code contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The exception classes are straightforward and standard.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard exception hierarchy.\n\n- **Risk scores:**  \n  Since the code is purely declarative with no executable or data-processing components, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted. The assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical set of custom exception classes used in network or HTTP client libraries.\n- No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- The code is safe, with no external inputs, no data processing, and no dangerous operations.\n\n---\n\n### Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, just for completeness, but effectively zero risk)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the scores are justified.",
