{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various timeout, HTTP, redirect, stream, and other error scenarios in network communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from external modules or components that raise exceptions during network operations.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising points where errors are propagated; no direct sinks that handle untrusted data or execute code.",
  "flows": "Error occurs at exception-raising points; no data flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are standard exception definitions with no embedded logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured hierarchy of custom exception classes for network-related errors, including timeouts, HTTP errors, redirects, stream errors, and miscellaneous issues. No external input handling, data processing, or execution of untrusted data is present. The classes are purely declarative, serving as error indicators rather than executing malicious actions. No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes intended for network error handling. There are no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks within this code segment.",
