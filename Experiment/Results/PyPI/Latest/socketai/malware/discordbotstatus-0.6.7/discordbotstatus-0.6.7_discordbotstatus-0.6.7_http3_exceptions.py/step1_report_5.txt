{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various timeout, HTTP, redirect, stream, and other error conditions related to HTTP communication and resource management.",
  "sources": "The code primarily consists of class definitions that do not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs, as this code only defines exception classes without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for network and HTTP errors, including timeouts, connection issues, HTTP errors, redirects, stream errors, and other specific cases. All classes are simple, containing only docstrings and no executable code or data handling logic. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of custom exceptions to be used in a larger HTTP client library. No sources, sinks, or flows suggest security risks or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining exception classes related to HTTP and network error handling. It does not include any malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The implementation is standard and safe.",
