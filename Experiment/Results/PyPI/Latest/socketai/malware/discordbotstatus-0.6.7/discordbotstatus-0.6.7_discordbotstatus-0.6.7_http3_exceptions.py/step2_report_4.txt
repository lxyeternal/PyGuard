  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines custom exception classes for network errors.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external input, data processing, or execution.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: Purely declarative, standard exception classes.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent, security risk, or obfuscation.\n- Malware Score: 0 — consistent.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — straightforward class definitions.\n- Risk Score: 0 — appropriate given the lack of any active or risky behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to Report 1, defining exception classes for HTTP errors.\n- Same reasoning applies.\n- Malware Score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk Score: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes for network errors, redirects, streaming, etc.\n- Same as above.\n- Malware Score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk Score: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for timeout, HTTP, redirect, stream errors.\n- Same as above.\n- Malware Score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk Score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for network and HTTP errors.\n- Same reasoning.\n- Malware Score: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk Score: 0.\n\n**Summary of findings:**\n- All reports describe standard exception class definitions with no embedded logic, no data handling, no external input processing, and no signs of malicious activity.\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as error indicators.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- Malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code content.\n- Risk scores are appropriately low (0), given the nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for network error handling.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis code appears to be a benign, standard part of a network library's error handling framework.",
