  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to network errors, timeouts, HTTP errors, redirects, streaming errors, and miscellaneous issues. There are no signs of embedded logic, data handling, or external interactions. The code appears to be a standard error handling module.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that these are purely declarative class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   \n   These scores seem reasonable given the nature of the code. Since the code is just exception class definitions, there’s no reason to assign any higher risk or malware scores.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a risk score higher than 0.5. The code is purely declarative, with no executable logic or external data handling that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions beyond the code's scope. They correctly identify that the code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Rationale**: The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes used for network error handling. It does not process untrusted data, does not execute code, and contains no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard exception hierarchy for a network or HTTP client library. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, declarative nature of the code.",
