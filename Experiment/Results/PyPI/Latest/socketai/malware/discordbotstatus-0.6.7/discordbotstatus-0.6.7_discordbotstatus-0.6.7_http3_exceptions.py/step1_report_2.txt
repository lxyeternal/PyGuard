  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to timeouts, HTTP errors, redirects, streaming errors, and other HTTP-related issues.",
  "sources": "Code does not read external input; defines exception classes only.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow, input/output, or data processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains class definitions for various exception types used in HTTP and network operations. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, input handling, or malicious constructs are present. The classes serve as structured exception types, which is standard practice in Python network libraries. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of well-defined exception classes for HTTP and network errors. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger networking library, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
