{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes and interfaces for HTTP request dispatching, stream I/O, connection pooling, and concurrency management, serving as infrastructure scaffolding.",
  "sources": "Class and method definitions, import statements, enum declarations, and type annotations; no external data or input reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "There are no active data flows; the code consists of method signatures and class structures only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, providing abstract base classes and interfaces for a network client library. It contains no active data processing, network connections, or embedded malicious logic. The methods are unimplemented, serving as templates for extension. No anomalies or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, interface-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of interface definitions for a network client framework. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The low risk score reflects the minimal inherent risk of such structural code. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use.",
