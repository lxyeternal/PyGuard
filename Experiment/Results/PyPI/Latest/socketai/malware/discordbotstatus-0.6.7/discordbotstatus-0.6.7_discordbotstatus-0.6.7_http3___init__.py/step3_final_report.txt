  "purpose": "Organizes and exposes components of a Python HTTP client library via import statements.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules; no runtime data input.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; purely static import structure.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes, functions, constants, and configurations from internal modules. It appears to be an __init__.py or main module file for a package, with no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, static code with no security concerns. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk score 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign import module for a Python HTTP client library, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
