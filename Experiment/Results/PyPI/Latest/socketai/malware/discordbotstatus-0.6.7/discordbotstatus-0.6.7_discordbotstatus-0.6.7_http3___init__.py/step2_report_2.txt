  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, focusing on the key aspects: presence of malicious code, anomalies, and consistency of scores.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a set of import statements organizing a Python HTTP client library.\n- They uniformly state there are no data sinks, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.95), indicating strong certainty that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Confirming the Code:**\n- The code only consists of import statements from local modules; no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity.\n- No signs of code execution, dynamic behavior, or data leaks.\n- No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n**Logical and Scoring Evaluation:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- The overall security risk score of 0 is consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely import statements, the likelihood of malicious payloads is negligible.\n- The reports do not identify any assumptions that could lead to false positives.\n- The scores assigned reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- The reasoning is sound; no adjustments needed.\n- Given the context, the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0, reflecting a safe, standard module setup.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a typical, well-structured import module for a Python HTTP client library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The current scoring is appropriate and justified.",
