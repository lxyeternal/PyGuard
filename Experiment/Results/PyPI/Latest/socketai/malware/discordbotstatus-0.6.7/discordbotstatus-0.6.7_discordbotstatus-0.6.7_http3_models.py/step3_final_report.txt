{
  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive HTTP client utility, handling URL parsing, request preparation, headers, cookies, and response processing, aimed at facilitating HTTP communications.",
  "sources": "URL strings, header fields, cookie data, request payloads, and stream inputs.",
  "sinks": "URL resolution, header setting, cookie management, response decoding, and data streaming.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from URL, headers, cookies, and request body into request objects; response data flows from network response through decoding and streaming to output content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client library utilizing common Python libraries (rfc3986, chardet, email, urllib). It handles URL normalization, request setup, header and cookie management, and response decoding with support for streaming. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage are present. The code does not perform any network exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden operations. It adheres to best practices for HTTP client design, with clear separation of concerns and proper handling of untrusted inputs. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign and standard nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and standard HTTP client utility with no malicious or sabotage features. The scores are accurate and justified, reflecting its benign and transparent implementation.",
