  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard URL, request, response, headers, cookies handling.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; uses standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The code is a typical HTTP client utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the scores. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1; standard HTTP client code.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; no suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard HTTP client features.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected; standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is reasonable; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Implements typical HTTP client features.\n- **Anomalies:** None; no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The scores and reasoning are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard HTTP client functionality.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2). Given the code's functionality and the absence of any suspicious activity, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — Very low; standard HTTP client code.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports' reasoning and scoring are consistent and justified. No adjustments needed. The overall security posture of this code is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation present.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client utility library with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
