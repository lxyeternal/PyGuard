  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code is standard SSL/TLS configuration, no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Verification:** The code manages SSL contexts, loads CA bundles, and handles certificates securely. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable given the code's purpose.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard SSL configuration with no malicious intent.  \n- **Verification:** Same reasoning applies; no malicious behaviors or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Configuration for SSL, no malicious activity.  \n- **Verification:** The code loads certificates and sets up SSL contexts securely. No network activity or malicious behaviors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2 are justified.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Standard SSL configuration and context management.  \n- **Verification:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Legitimate SSL/TLS configuration code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Verification:** Uses standard practices, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 are justified.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not contain any malicious or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting standard configuration code with minimal security risk. Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious behaviors, these scores are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's purpose and the analysis provided.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.  \n- The code appears to be a well-structured, secure configuration module for SSL/TLS, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)  \n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's transparent, standard implementation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The current scoring accurately reflects its security posture.",
