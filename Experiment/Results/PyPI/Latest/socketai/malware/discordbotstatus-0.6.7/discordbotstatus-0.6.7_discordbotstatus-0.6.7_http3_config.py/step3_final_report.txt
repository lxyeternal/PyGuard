  "purpose": "SSL/TLS configuration and context management for secure network connections, including certificate handling, verification modes, and SSL context creation.",
  "sources": "Certificate paths provided by user, verify flag, environment variables, certifi CA bundle, and internal SSL context methods.",
  "sinks": "SSL context creation and configuration, certificate loading, verification setup, cipher configuration, protocol options.",
  "flows": "Input from cert/path or verify flag → load_ssl_context_verify/load_ssl_context_no_verify → SSL context setup with certificates and options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual data flows detected. Use of asyncio for background SSL context loading is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SSL/TLS configuration module. It manages SSL contexts for verified and unverified connections, loads CA bundles from certifi or user paths, and sets SSL options and ciphers securely. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of asyncio for loading SSL contexts is appropriate for non-blocking operations. The certificate handling is flexible and secure, relying on trusted sources and user input. The overall structure is clear, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SSL/TLS configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
