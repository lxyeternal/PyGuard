{
  "purpose": "This code provides configuration and utility classes for managing SSL/TLS, timeouts, and connection pooling in an HTTP client library, with no specific application logic.",
  "sources": "Reads from imported modules (__version__, os, ssl, certifi) and class initializations, environment variables indirectly via os.path, certifi.where().",
  "sinks": "Uses ssl contexts and cert files which could potentially load untrusted or malicious certificates if tampered with. Loads certificate files from user-provided paths.",
  "flows": "User provides 'cert' and 'verify' parameters to SSLConfig, which are used to load SSL contexts with specified certificate chains or verify paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Use of 'load_cert_chain' with user-provided paths is standard but depends on external inputs. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily configuration management for SSL/TLS, timeouts, and connection pools. It carefully manages SSL context creation, supports custom CA bundles, and loads certificates based on user input. It relies on external modules and system files, but all interactions appear standard and secure within the intended context. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected; code appears to be well-structured configuration code with proper security considerations. No indications of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration utility for managing SSL/TLS, timeouts, and connection pools in a Python HTTP client. It performs standard security-related setup functions without malicious intent or behavior. There are no signs of malware or malicious exploits; it appears safe and legitimate.",
