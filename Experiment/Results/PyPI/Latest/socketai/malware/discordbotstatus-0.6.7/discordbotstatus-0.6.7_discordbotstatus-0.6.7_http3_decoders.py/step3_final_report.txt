{
  "purpose": "Provides content decoding handlers for HTTP content-encoding such as identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli, enabling decompression of compressed HTTP payloads.",
  "sources": "decode() methods of each decoder class, which receive compressed data as input.",
  "sinks": "The decode() methods process data internally; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the decode() methods of decoders; data is decompressed and returned; flush() methods finalize the decompression process.",
  "anomalies": "The assert statement in BrotliDecoder's __init__ method, used to check for optional brotli library presence, is standard and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard content decoders with proper error handling and optional dependency management. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The optional brotli library is handled with a conditional import and an assert statement, which is common practice. The decoders process untrusted data passed into their decode methods, which is expected for such functionality. The potential for resource exhaustion exists if maliciously crafted compressed data is processed, but this is a known and general risk with decompressors, not indicative of malicious intent. No external network communication or data exfiltration occurs. Overall, the implementation is straightforward, safe, and aligns with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of HTTP content decoders supporting identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minor assertion in BrotliDecoder is a typical dependency check and does not pose a security risk. The overall security risk score remains very low, and the malware score is zero.",
