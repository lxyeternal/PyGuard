{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for decoding content-encoded data, supporting multiple encoding types such as identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli.",
  "sources": "Imports from Python standard libraries (typing, zlib), optional brotli library, and local exceptions module.",
  "sinks": "Decoders process input data; no sinks directly write or send data externally in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to decoder.decode() methods, which process and return decoded bytes; then flush() methods finalize decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or malicious behavior; use of assert in BrotliDecoder could be considered questionable but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements multiple data decoders for content-encoding, with proper exception handling and optional dependency management for brotli. The only notable point is the assert statement in BrotliDecoder, which could potentially be used to halt execution if brotli is not installed, but this is standard practice for dependency validation. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The design appears to be a straightforward implementation of content decoders with dependency checks and a flexible multi-decoder handler.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of content decoders for HTTP content-encoding, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It includes standard dependency management and exception handling, with no evident security concerns.",
