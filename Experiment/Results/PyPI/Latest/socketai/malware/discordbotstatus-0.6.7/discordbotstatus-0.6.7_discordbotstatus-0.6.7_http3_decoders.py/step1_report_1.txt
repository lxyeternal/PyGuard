{
  "purpose": "This code provides content decoding functionality for HTTP content encoding, supporting multiple compression algorithms such as identity, gzip, deflate, and optionally brotli.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from method inputs such as the decode() functions of decoders and the initialization parameters of decoders, including data passed into decompress methods.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs decompressed data via the decode() and flush() methods, and raises DecodingError exceptions on errors. No external data or untrusted input is directly sent over the network or stored.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed into decoder instances' decode() methods, processed through multiple decoder objects (including nested/brotli if available), and results are returned or exceptions raised. No external or untrusted data flows outside these methods.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The only notable assert is in BrotliDecoder's __init__, which ensures the brotli library is installed, but this is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of decoder classes to handle various content encodings, supporting identity, gzip, deflate, and optionally brotli. The decoders use standard library functions and handle errors gracefully by raising DecodingError. The MultiDecoder allows chaining decoders in reverse order. The SUPPORTED_DECODERS dictionary maps encoding names to decoder classes, dynamically removing 'br' if brotli isn't available. The code includes standard imports and handles optional dependencies safely. There are no indications of malicious intent, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard, well-structured content decoding functionality using common libraries. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code. The only minor concern is the assert in BrotliDecoder, which is standard for optional dependencies and does not pose a security risk.",
