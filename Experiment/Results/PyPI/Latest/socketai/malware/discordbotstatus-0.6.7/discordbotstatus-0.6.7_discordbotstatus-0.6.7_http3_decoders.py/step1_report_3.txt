{
  "purpose": "This code implements various content decoding handlers for HTTP responses, supporting identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli encodings. It provides a framework to decode compressed data streams.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'decode' methods of decoder classes, which accept compressed data bytes.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data returned by the 'decode' methods, but no direct output to external systems or network within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input to decode() methods in decoders, processed through chained decoders if multiple encodings are used, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code properly handles optional brotli library import, raises appropriate exceptions, and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decoder framework for HTTP content encoding, with implementations for identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli. Each decoder correctly handles errors, and the MultiDecoder allows for layered decoding. The optional brotli library is handled gracefully. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All functionalities are straightforward and related to data decompression. The code structure and imports are standard, with no suspicious or obfuscated parts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of content decoders for HTTP response handling. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks within this module. It performs standard data decompression tasks without external side effects or malicious behavior.",
