  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of HTTP content decoders supporting identity, gzip, deflate, and brotli. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minor assertion in BrotliDecoder is a typical dependency check and does not pose a security risk. The overall security risk score remains very low, and the malware score is zero."
