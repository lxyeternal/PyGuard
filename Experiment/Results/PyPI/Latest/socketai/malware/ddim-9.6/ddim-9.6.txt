      "conclusion": "The code unconditionally executes 'main()' during installation, which is highly suspicious and can be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. This pattern introduces a significant security risk, especially in supply chain contexts. The current scores (malware 0.75, risk 0.8) are appropriate, but should be considered conservative. Overall, the package should be treated with caution, and the contents of 'main()' should be reviewed before installation."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While it lacks malicious payloads or destructive actions, its intent and network activity warrant a high security concern. The malware score is set at 0.6, reflecting exfiltration behavior without payloads, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.65 due to privacy invasion and suspicious network activity."
