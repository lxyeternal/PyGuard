  "conclusion": "The code unconditionally executes 'main()' during installation, which is highly suspicious and can be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. This pattern introduces a significant security risk, especially in supply chain contexts. The current scores (malware 0.75, risk 0.8) are appropriate, but should be considered conservative. Overall, the package should be treated with caution, and the contents of 'main()' should be reviewed before installation."
