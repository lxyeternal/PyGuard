  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior or security risks in the setup script that executes 'main()' during installation.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' from local module 'main' and executing 'main()' unconditionally in the 'run()' method of a custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during installation, which could run arbitrary or malicious code.",
  "flows": "During 'run()', the code calls 'install.run(self)' then imports 'main' and executes 'main()' directly.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code ('main()') during package installation without validation or safeguards.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, during its 'run()' method, unconditionally imports and executes 'main()' from a local module. This behavior is atypical and poses a high security risk, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the act of executing external code without validation is suspicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.75, risk around 0.8) are justified given the potential for malicious payloads. The overall risk is high because this pattern can be exploited for supply chain attacks, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The trustworthiness of 'main()' is unknown, so the behavior should be treated as potentially malicious. The scores should be adjusted slightly upward to reflect the high severity of executing untrusted code during setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code unconditionally executes 'main()' during installation, which is highly suspicious and can be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. This pattern introduces a significant security risk, especially in supply chain contexts. The current scores (malware 0.75, risk 0.8) are appropriate, but should be considered conservative. Overall, the package should be treated with caution, and the contents of 'main()' should be reviewed before installation.",
