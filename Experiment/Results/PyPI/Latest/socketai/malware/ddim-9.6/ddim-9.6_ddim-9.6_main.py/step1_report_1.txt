  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), retrieves MAC addresses via subprocess calls, and gathers environment variables.",
  "sinks": "URLs constructed with user data and sent via urllib.request.urlopen() to external domains.",
  "flows": "Source functions collect data -> data is encoded or included as URL parameters -> URL is requested over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of subprocess to obtain MAC addresses could be sensitive; sending base64-encoded MAC addresses to external servers. The URLs seem suspicious (non-standard domains, possibly malicious infrastructure). No explicit user consent or data protection measures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers environment and network-related information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses). MAC addresses are encoded in base64, likely to obfuscate their content slightly, then transmitted via GET requests to three external URLs. The URLs do not appear to be legitimate or associated with trusted services; they are likely malicious or used for tracking. The code does not perform any input validation, error handling is minimal, and the use of subprocess for MAC addresses could be a privacy concern. The overall purpose seems to be to exfiltrate system data stealthily, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely intended for malicious data exfiltration, collecting system info and sending it to suspicious domains. The use of encoded MAC addresses and untrusted URLs indicates malicious behavior. The overall security risk is high, and this package should be considered dangerous.",
