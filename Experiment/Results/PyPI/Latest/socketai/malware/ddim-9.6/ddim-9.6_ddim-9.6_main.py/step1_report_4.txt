  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname, getpass.getuser() for username, os.getcwd() for current directory, get_mac_addresses() function reading system interfaces and executing system commands.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) -> URL encoding -> HTTP GET request to multiple external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with seemingly suspicious domains, base64 encoding MAC addresses (possibly for obfuscation), and sending system data without user consent or obvious purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system-specific data such as hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are collected through platform-specific system commands, which could be considered intrusive. The data is encoded in base64, potentially to obfuscate the content. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends requests to multiple external servers, which are suspicious domains that may be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. There are no explicit payloads, command injections, or backdoors, but the act of collecting and transmitting system info without user consent indicates privacy risk. The external URLs look suspicious and are likely malicious or part of a malicious command-and-control infrastructure. The code does not contain obfuscated code, but the purpose appears to be gathering system info and transmitting it covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting and transmitting system information to external servers, which is suspicious, especially given the domains involved. Although no explicit malicious actions like payload execution or data theft are present, the behavior suggests potential privacy invasion or malicious surveillance. The use of obfuscation techniques is minimal, but the suspicious domains and data exfiltration indicate malicious intent.",
