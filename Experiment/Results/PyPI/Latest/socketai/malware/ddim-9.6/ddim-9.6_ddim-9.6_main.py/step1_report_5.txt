{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, encodes the MAC addresses, and sends this data to multiple external URLs as part of HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), collects MAC addresses via subprocess calls, and encodes data with base64.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs with encoded system data as query parameters using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered and encoded, then included as URL parameters in outbound GET requests to external domains, potentially leaking user environment details.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious external domains (oast.cn, oast.fun) known for security testing and C2 activities. Encodes MAC addresses and sends them without user consent. No authentication or encryption is employed in data transmission. No validation of URL responses or error handling beyond silent exception passing.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system-specific details, encodes MAC addresses, and sends this information to multiple external servers. The choice of domains and the data sent suggest potential for privacy violation or malicious tracking. The code lacks any authentication, encryption, or user consent mechanisms. The use of base64 encoding may obscure the data but does not prevent it from being transmitted. The overall behavior aligns with activity typical of data exfiltration or malicious tracking modules. There is no evidence of malicious payload delivery or destructive actions within the code. The external domains are suspicious, but the script itself does not perform destructive actions or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs data collection and exfiltration of system information to external servers, potentially for malicious tracking or privacy invasion. It does not contain destructive malware, but its behavior suggests malicious intent in privacy violation and possible covert surveillance. The use of suspicious domains and unencrypted data transmission raises security concerns.",
