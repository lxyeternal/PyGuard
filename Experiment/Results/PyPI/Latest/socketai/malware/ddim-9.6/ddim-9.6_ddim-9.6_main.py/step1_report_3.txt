  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to remote servers via encoded URLs.",
  "sources": "getpass.getuser(), platform.node(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function, and hardcoded URLs.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send HTTP GET requests to external domains with system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is gathered, encoded, and appended as URL parameters; these URLs are then requested, potentially transmitting data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains (some with 'oast' and unusual TLDs), encoding of MAC addresses, and sending system info without user consent or notification. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script collects various system identifiers, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and constructs URLs pointing to potentially suspicious domains. It performs network requests to these domains with system info as URL parameters, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. No malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors is evident. The use of seemingly malicious domains (oast domains) suggests testing or staging environments rather than malicious intent, but the behavior pattern resembles data collection that could be misused. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily collects system info and sends it to external servers, which can be considered privacy-invasive. It does not show clear signs of malware such as backdoors, remote code execution, or system damage. However, its behavior could be used maliciously for fingerprinting or reconnaissance without user consent, representing a security concern. Overall, the code's malicious potential is low, but it is privacy-intrusive.",
