  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While it lacks malicious payloads or destructive actions, its intent and network activity warrant a high security concern. The malware score is set at 0.6, reflecting exfiltration behavior without payloads, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.65 due to privacy invasion and suspicious network activity."
