{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes and transmits this data to external suspicious domains via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include platform.system() for OS detection, subprocess calls for MAC addresses, getpass.getuser() for username, platform.node() for hostname, os.getcwd() for current directory, and random.randint() for generating a number used in URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "The untrusted data flows into URL parameters in HTTP GET requests sent via urllib.request.urlopen() to external domains, which could lead to data exfiltration or privacy violations.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into URL parameters, which are then transmitted over the network to external URLs without validation or encryption, constituting a source-to-sink data flow indicative of potential exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses subprocess to gather MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and transmits data to suspicious domains. No user consent prompts or encryption are present. The URLs are suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script performs system info collection and transmits it to external servers, which is typical of covert data exfiltration. The use of subprocess for MAC addresses and base64 encoding are straightforward and not obfuscation. The URLs are suspicious, indicating potential malicious intent. No malicious payloads or destructive actions are present, but the behavior aligns with privacy-invasive exfiltration. The code's simplicity and network activity suggest a high potential for malicious use, especially if deployed without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily designed for covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. While it lacks malicious payloads or destructive actions, its intent and network activity warrant a high security concern. The malware score is set at 0.6, reflecting exfiltration behavior without payloads, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.65 due to privacy invasion and suspicious network activity.",
