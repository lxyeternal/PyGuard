  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in Base64.",
  "sources": "Platform information (platform.system(), platform.node()), user input (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (get_mac_addresses function), random number (random.randint), and the URL parameters (urllib.parse.urlencode).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen calls to send data to external URLs with constructed query parameters.",
  "flows": "Data from system information sources (hostname, username, current_path, MAC addresses) flows into URL parameters, which are then sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun), which appear as command-and-control or testing domains. Base64 encoding of MAC addresses could be used to obfuscate sensitive data. The code collects MAC addresses without user consent. No explicit hardcoded credentials or backdoors are found. Random number generation is used to create a URL query parameter, possibly for tracking or correlation.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system identifiers (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) and encodes the MAC addresses in Base64. It then constructs URLs with these parameters, including a random number to possibly identify or correlate requests. The URLs point to domains that appear suspicious or test domains. The data is sent via HTTP GET requests to these URLs, which could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or exfiltration without user consent. No malicious payloads or code injection is detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The use of external domains and data collection suggests potential privacy violations or covert data exfiltration, but there are no signs of harmful actions such as damage, malware, or reverse shells.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and transmits it to external servers, potentially for tracking or covert purposes. The use of suspicious domain names and encoding of MAC addresses raises privacy and security concerns. There is no clear malware functionality or destructive behavior, but the data collection and transmission could be malicious depending on context. Overall, moderate security risk due to data exfiltration potential.",
