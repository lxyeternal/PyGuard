{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for gathering system information, specifically IP geolocation, and sending various data, including files and messages, to multiple messaging platforms (Telegram, Discord) and a custom API endpoint. It likely functions as a data exfiltration or monitoring tool.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment data (via IP geolocation API), local files in specified directories, and potentially user-provided text messages.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to external servers: Telegram API, Discord webhook URL, and a custom API endpoint, which may receive sensitive information or files.",
  "flows": "Untrusted or sensitive data from local files and optional text flows from the local system to remote servers through API calls, webhooks, or messaging platforms. IP info is gathered and incorporated into messages, then transmitted alongside files or text.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials and webhook URLs (e.g., Telegram bot token, Discord webhook URL) are present, which is suspicious and insecure. The code collects and sends potentially sensitive system info and files without user consent or explicit control. The function 'send_directory_files' filters files by extension but then calls 'send_to_all' with unfiltered file list, which may lead to unintended data leaks. No explicit validation or encryption of data before sending. No apparent obfuscation, but the inclusion of hardcoded secrets and broad data exfiltration logic are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with hardcoded API keys, tokens, and URLs, which is a security risk. It collects IP geolocation data and can send arbitrary files and messages to external endpoints, including Telegram, Discord, and a custom API. The methods for sending files read local files and transmit them in various formats, including base64 encoding for the API. The function 'send_directory_files' filters files by extension and then transmits them, potentially leading to unintended data exposure. No input validation or encryption is seen for transmitted data. The hardcoded credentials and the ability to exfiltrate files and system info are significant red flags. The code appears to be designed for covert data collection or exfiltration, possibly malicious, especially if deployed without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious indicators such as hardcoded secret tokens and URLs, data exfiltration capabilities, and collection of system info and files for external servers. These behaviors suggest a high probability of malicious intent. The overall security risk is very high, and the package should be considered unsafe for use.",
