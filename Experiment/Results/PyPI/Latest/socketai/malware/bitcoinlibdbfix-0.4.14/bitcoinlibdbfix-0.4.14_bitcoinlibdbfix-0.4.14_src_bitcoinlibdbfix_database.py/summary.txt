  "conclusion": "The code functions as a data exfiltration tool with high security risks due to hardcoded secrets and unrestricted file transmission. It does not contain active malware or obfuscation but exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious data collection. The malware score is justified at approximately 0.75, reflecting significant exfiltration capability without active payloads. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is around 0.8, indicating high potential for misuse. These assessments are consistent with the observed behavior and potential for malicious exploitation."
