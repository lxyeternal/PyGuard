  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated code, dynamic eval/exec, suspicious strings, hardcoded URLs/IPs, environment/system calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, command execution, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources involving eval/exec or network patterns leading to potential data exfiltration or system impact.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious strings, potential data exfiltration signs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Suspicious patterns like hardcoded URLs/IPs and eval/exec suggest potential malicious intent, but no concrete payloads or exfiltration are confirmed. Benign code shows no anomalies. Scores are assigned based on suspicion levels, with higher scores in obfuscation and moderate malware likelihood. The analysis indicates suspicion but not definitive malicious activity, warranting cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion. However, without confirmed malicious payloads, it cannot be conclusively classified as malicious. The scores reflect this cautious suspicion, emphasizing the need for further dynamic/static analysis before definitive judgment.",
