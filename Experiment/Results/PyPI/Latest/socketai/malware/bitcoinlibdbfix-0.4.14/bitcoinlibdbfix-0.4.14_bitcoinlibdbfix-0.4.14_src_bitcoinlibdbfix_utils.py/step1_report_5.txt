  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic utility or example script that performs a simple operation, likely related to demonstrating functionality or testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via input() functions, reads environment variables, and may import modules which could include external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, file writes, network calls, or subprocess executions (if present), which could be used to leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources or environment variables to processing functions and then to outputs such as print, file, or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets are present; no unusual or obfuscated code constructs are visible. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis shows the code performs simple input/output operations, possibly with some external modules. No suspicious function calls or data handling anomalies are detected. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are identified. The code's overall behavior is consistent with benign utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided code. It appears to be a benign script with no indications of malware or supply chain attacks.",
