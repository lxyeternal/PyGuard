  "purpose": "Bitcoin wallet management including creation, listing, key generation, transaction import, and sending.",
  "sources": "User arguments, input files, library functions (bitcoinlib).",
  "sinks": "Wallet operations, transaction broadcasting, printing sensitive data (passphrases, WIFs, transaction hashes).",
  "flows": "Input data from args/files to wallet functions; sensitive data printed directly; transaction data sent over network.",
  "anomalies": "Printing sensitive secrets (passphrases, private keys) directly to stdout; incomplete multisig implementation; use of passphrase as keys parameter.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet management functions with no malicious code or sabotage. The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets via print statements, which could lead to data leakage. The wallet creation method may misuse the 'keys' parameter by passing a passphrase string, indicating potential logical flaws. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. Scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate; security risk scores (0.2-0.3) reflect the exposure of sensitive data but no active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, implementing typical wallet functions without malicious intent. The primary security issue is the insecure printing of secrets, which should be mitigated. No signs of sabotage or malware are evident.",
