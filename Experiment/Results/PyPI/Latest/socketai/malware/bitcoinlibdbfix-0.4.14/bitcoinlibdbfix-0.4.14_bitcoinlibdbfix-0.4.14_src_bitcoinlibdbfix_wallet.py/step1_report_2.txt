{
  "purpose": "The code manages Bitcoin wallets, including creation, listing, key generation, transaction import, and sending transactions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function arguments (args), user input from JSON files, wallet files, and environment variables (indirectly through imported libraries).",
  "sinks": "Uses Wallet.create(), wallet.transaction_import(), and wallet.send_to() which interact with blockchain network and local storage; also prints data including passphrases and WIF keys.",
  "flows": "Input args -> wallet creation/import/send functions -> blockchain/network or local storage; passphrases and keys are generated and printed.",
  "anomalies": "Passphrases and private keys are printed directly to the console, which can lead to leakage if console output is captured. No explicit input sanitization or validation for file content. No hardcoded credentials. Wallet creation and key generation seem standard, but printing sensitive data is risky.",
  "analysis": "The code handles wallet and key management using the bitcoinlib library. It reads sensitive data such as passphrases and WIF keys and outputs them directly, which poses a security risk if logs or consoles are exposed. The functions use external inputs like filenames and args, but no evidence of malicious code or backdoors. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code is present. The only potential security concern is the exposure of sensitive information via print statements. The code itself appears to implement legitimate wallet functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical wallet operations with no clear malicious behavior. The primary concern is the insecure handling of sensitive information through console output, which could lead to information leakage if logs are not protected. No evidence of malware or sabotage present.",
