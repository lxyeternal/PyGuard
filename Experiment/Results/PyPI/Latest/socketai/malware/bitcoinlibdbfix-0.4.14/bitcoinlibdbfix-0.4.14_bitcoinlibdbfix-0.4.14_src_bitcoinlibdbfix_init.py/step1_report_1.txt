{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module exports and perform a pre-installation check by calling a function if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for main, __version__, and run_pre_install; execution of run_pre_install during import",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of run_pre_install which could contain malicious code, but in this context, it's likely a setup routine",
  "flows": "Import statements -> import of run_pre_install -> execution of run_pre_install if present",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally executes run_pre_install upon import, which is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code sets exports for main and version, then attempts to import and run run_pre_install from an installer module. If the module is present, run_pre_install is invoked immediately during import, which is a common pattern for setup routines but could be misused if run_pre_install contains malicious code. However, without the implementation of run_pre_install, this appears as a typical pre-install check. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious network activity. The design is straightforward, with safe practices generally followed.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs standard setup tasks with a conditional pre-install check. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on this code alone.",
