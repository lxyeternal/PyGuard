  "purpose": "Module initialization and setup for a Python package, including importing main functions, version info, and running pre-install checks.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .cli, .version, and optionally .installer",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_pre_install() during import, which could perform any pre-install tasks",
  "flows": "Import statements -> optional run_pre_install() call",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally executes run_pre_install() during import, which is somewhat unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package exports and attempts to run a pre-install routine if available. The import and execution pattern is standard for setup scripts. The try-except block suppresses ImportError, ensuring safe handling if run_pre_install() is not present. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a Python package's setup process. The run_pre_install() function might perform setup tasks, but without seeing its implementation, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
