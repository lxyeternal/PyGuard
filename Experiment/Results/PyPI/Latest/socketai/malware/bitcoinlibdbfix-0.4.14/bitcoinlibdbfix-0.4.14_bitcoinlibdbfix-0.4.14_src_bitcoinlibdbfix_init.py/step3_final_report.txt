  "purpose": "The code initializes the package by importing core components and conditionally executing a pre-install routine during import.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'main', '__version__', and 'run_pre_install' from '.installer'. The call to 'run_pre_install()' during import.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'run_pre_install()' during import, which could perform any action if malicious, but no specific sinks like network or file operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Import of 'run_pre_install' -> execution of 'run_pre_install()' during module import.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic invocation of 'run_pre_install()' during import is somewhat unusual and could be exploited if the function is malicious, but no malicious code or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup tasks, importing core modules and executing a pre-install hook if available. The pattern of executing code during import is common but can be risky if the function is malicious. All reports correctly identify this pattern and assign low malware scores (0) and moderate risk scores (~0.2 to 0.4). No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The primary concern is the potential misuse of 'run_pre_install()' during import, but no evidence of malicious activity exists in the snippet. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and the overall risk is low but warrants review of 'run_pre_install()' implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module with a conditional pre-install hook executed during import. No malicious activity is evident, but the automatic execution pattern warrants caution. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is absent, and the risk score should be around 0.4 to reflect the potential risk of executing arbitrary code during import.",
