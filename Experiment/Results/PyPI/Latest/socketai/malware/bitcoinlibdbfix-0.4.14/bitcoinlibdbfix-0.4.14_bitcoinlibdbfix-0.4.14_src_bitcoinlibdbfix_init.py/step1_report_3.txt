  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of run_pre_install() without clear validation, potential for malicious pre-install checks if run_pre_install() is malicious",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and attempts to execute a pre-install hook by importing run_pre_install from a local installer module. This is wrapped in a try-except block to prevent import errors from halting execution. The use of a pre-install hook could be exploited if run_pre_install() contains malicious code, as it executes during package import. However, based solely on this snippet, the implementation appears standard for setup procedures. There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious logic shown. The main concern is the potential for malicious behavior if run_pre_install() is compromised, but the code itself is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally standard for a Python package's initialization and pre-install checks. No explicit malicious behavior is evident, but the execution of run_pre_install() during import could be a vector if the function is malicious. Overall, low suspicion based on this code snippet alone.",
