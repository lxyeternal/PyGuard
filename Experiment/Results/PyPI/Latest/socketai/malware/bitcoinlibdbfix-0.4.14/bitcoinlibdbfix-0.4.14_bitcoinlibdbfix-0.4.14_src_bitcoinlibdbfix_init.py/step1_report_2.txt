  "purpose": "This code is setting up a Python package's __init__.py to define exports, perform pre-install checks, and manage version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.cli, .version, .installer) and execution of run_pre_install() if available.",
  "sinks": "Execution of run_pre_install() when imported, which may perform arbitrary actions.",
  "flows": "Import .installer, then execute run_pre_install() if import succeeds.",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally executes run_pre_install() during import without explicit context; this may be unusual but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core modules for CLI and version info, then exposes them. It attempts to import run_pre_install from a local installer module and executes it during import if available, wrapped in a try-except block to silently ignore ImportError. This pattern suggests pre-install checks or setup routines, which is common in package initialization. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The only notable point is that run_pre_install() is run automatically upon import, which could be misused if the function is malicious or performs unintended actions. However, without more context on run_pre_install(), it appears as a standard pre-install hook.\n\nOverall, no malicious behavior or malware indicators are evident from this snippet. The automatic execution is a design choice but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package setup tasks with a conditional pre-install step. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this snippet alone. The automatic execution of run_pre_install() is typical for setup routines and does not indicate malicious intent.",
