  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their reasoning, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code performs standard module setup, exports, and attempts to run `run_pre_install()` if available.\n- The `run_pre_install()` function is invoked during import, which is somewhat unusual but common in setup routines.\n- No report indicates any evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- The primary concern raised is the automatic execution of `run_pre_install()` during import, which could be exploited if the function is malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's behavior:\n\n- The code imports `main`, `__version__`, and conditionally `run_pre_install`.\n- If `run_pre_install` exists, it is called immediately during import.\n- The `try-except` block ensures that if `installer` is missing, no error occurs.\n\n**This is a typical pattern for setup or pre-install routines, not inherently malicious.**\n\n---\n\n### Issues and logical flaws:\n\n- **No issues in the code itself**; the logic is straightforward and standard.\n- The **automatic invocation** of `run_pre_install()` could be a vector if the function is malicious, but the code snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification for scores |\n|---------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | The code is standard; no malware, obfuscation, or high risk. The risk score is low, justified by the potential for misuse if `run_pre_install()` is malicious, but no evidence here. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Same reasoning; standard setup code, execution of `run_pre_install()` during import is typical, no malware. |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Same; no malicious activity detected, just standard pre-install hook. |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0.4          | Slightly higher risk due to the possibility of malicious `run_pre_install()`, but no evidence. Still, conservative score. |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0.2          | Consistent with others; standard setup, no malware. |\n\n**Note:** The `securityRisk` scores are mostly 0.2, which seems reasonable given the automatic execution pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n\n- Since no malicious code or obfuscation is present, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score remains at 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The automatic execution of `run_pre_install()` warrants a note, but without evidence of malicious behavior, it remains a standard pattern.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, justified by potential misuse if `run_pre_install()` is malicious, but no evidence here)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical setup module with a conditional pre-install hook. No malicious activity is evident, and the scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the implementation of `run_pre_install()` before deployment or distribution to ensure it does not contain malicious code, especially since it runs during import.",
