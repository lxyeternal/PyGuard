  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a standard Python script or module, potentially part of a larger application. Without specific comments or context, its purpose cannot be definitively determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include any external data inputs, environment variables, or files that may be read within the code. Since no explicit input functions or file reads are visible, no concrete sources are identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, system commands, or data writes. No such sinks are explicitly found in the provided code. Without external interactions, there are no clear data leaks or dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Data flow paths from sources to sinks cannot be established due to the absence of input/output operations or external data handling within the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows the code comprises standard Python constructs, possibly defining functions, classes, or logic flow. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are present. The code does not manipulate environment variables insecurely, use unsafe SQL, or perform unsafe operations. Lack of external calls or data handling suggests a benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
