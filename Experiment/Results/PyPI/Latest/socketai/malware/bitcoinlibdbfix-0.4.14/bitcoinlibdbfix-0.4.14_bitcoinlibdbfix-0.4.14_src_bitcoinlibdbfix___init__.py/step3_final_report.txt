  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis for malicious patterns, obfuscation, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, external files, network communication, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve printing, executing commands, writing files, network transmission, or system modifications that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like system commands or network transmissions, potentially without sanitization or validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code appears straightforward with no unusual language features or dynamic execution anomalies.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently identify no evidence of malicious activity, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough reviews despite incomplete code snippets. Risk scores are low (0.1–0.3), acknowledging potential input validation concerns but no direct threats. The reasoning in each report aligns with the findings, and the scores are justified based on the provided descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no detected malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate, and the malware scores should remain at 0. Overall, the code appears safe for use, with only minimal concern due to incomplete context. The assessments are consistent and justified.",
