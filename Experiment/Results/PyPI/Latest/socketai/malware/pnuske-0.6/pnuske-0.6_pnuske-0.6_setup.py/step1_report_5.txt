{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'pnuske' Python package.",
  "sources": "Code reads package metadata and configuration data, including package name, version, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'pnuske:run' via console script, which could execute arbitrary code when invoked.",
  "flows": "User runs 'pnuske' command -> invokes 'pnuske:run' function in package -> potential execution of code within that function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and entry points for command-line execution. It appears to be a straightforward setup script with no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The 'entry_points' line enables execution of 'pnuske:run', which is a common pattern for CLI tools. No unusual imports, data reads, or suspicious behaviors are present. As this is a standard setup script, it does not contain malware or security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It provides package metadata and defines a console script entry point without any suspicious or harmful behaviors.",
