{
  "purpose": "Configure package setup for distribution of the 'pnuske' Python project.",
  "sources": "The 'setup.py' script and its function calls, specifically 'find_packages()' and the 'entry_points' specification.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no runtime data handling or network operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration defines package metadata and entry points but does not involve data flows or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. Use of standard 'setuptools' functions and straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with basic package metadata, including name, version, packages, and entry points. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution observed. The 'entry_points' define a console script that invokes 'pnuske:run', which is typical for CLI tools. No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package with a command-line interface. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
