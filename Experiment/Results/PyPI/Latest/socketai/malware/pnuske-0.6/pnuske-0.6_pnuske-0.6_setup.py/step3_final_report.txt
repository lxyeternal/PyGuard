  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata and entry point.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input, data, or dynamic code; only static setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or execution of untrusted code within this script.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' is a reference, not executed here.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, conventional setup code with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools. It declares package info and a console script entry point. There are no embedded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs. The 'pnuske:run' entry point could execute arbitrary code when invoked, but this is standard for CLI tools and does not indicate malicious intent within the setup script itself. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores. The slight variation in security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) reflects cautious acknowledgment that the actual behavior depends on the implementation of 'pnuske:run', which is outside this code's scope.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the implementation of the 'pnuske' module's 'run' function, which is not part of this code. All reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",
