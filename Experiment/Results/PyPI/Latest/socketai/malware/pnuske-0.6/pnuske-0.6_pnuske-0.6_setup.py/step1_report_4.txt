  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pnuske' Python package, defining package metadata and entry points for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "The script reads package configuration data and attempts to locate packages with find_packages()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the entry point 'pnuske:run' suggests execution of a function within the 'pnuske' module",
  "flows": "The setup process does not process external data at runtime; the entry point may invoke code that is not visible here",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present; the script is a standard setup configuration",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools, defines package metadata, and specifies an entry point for command-line execution. It appears to be a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code. The 'find_packages()' call is standard for including all packages in the directory. The entry point directs to 'pnuske:run', which could execute code in that module, but no malicious behavior can be inferred from this script alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution and command-line usage.",
