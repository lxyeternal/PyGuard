{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'run' from a local module 'main'. Its purpose appears to be to include or execute functionality defined elsewhere within the same package.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the 'main' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as data output, network connections, or execution of untrusted code in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present within this code snippet itself; it merely imports a function.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for module imports. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module. It does not execute any code, perform I/O, or include any potentially malicious operations. As a single import statement, it poses no security risk by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where 'run' may be invoked elsewhere.",
