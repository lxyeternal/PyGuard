  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .main import run`.\n- No code execution, data flow, or external communication is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate given the minimal code.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Confirms the benign nature; no issues found.  \n- Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Also confirms benignity; no suspicious behavior.  \n- Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Same conclusion; minimal code, no malicious activity.  \n- Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Consistent with previous assessments; no issues.  \n- Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same as others; straightforward import.  \n- Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the uniformity and simplicity of the code, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard import statement with no security concerns.\n\n**However,** if I were to assign a risk score myself, I would also assign **0** due to the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.",
