  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely to execute or invoke some main process.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.main' indicates data or code is being imported from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this snippet; potential risks depend on how 'run' is used downstream.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported 'run' function, but the code snippet does not show execution or usage of 'run'.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of an import statement; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is minimal, involving a single import from a local module. Without further code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The context of how 'run' is used is missing, so analysis is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, simply importing a function from a local module.",
