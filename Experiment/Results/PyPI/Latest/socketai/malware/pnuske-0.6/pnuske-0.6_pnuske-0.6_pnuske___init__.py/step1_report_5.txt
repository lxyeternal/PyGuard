  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely for execution or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module ('main'), which may load code or data at import time.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data; only an import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow detected beyond module import; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single relative import statement. It does not execute any untrusted code, handle user input, or perform network or file operations. The import is from a local module named 'main' and imports a 'run' object or function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a normal part of a larger project setup.",
