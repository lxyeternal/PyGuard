{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script that includes an obfuscated class designed to execute a decrypted payload during installation on Windows systems, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the filesystem (setup parameters), environment variables, and network requests within the run() method when OS is Windows.",
  "sinks": "The decrypted payload executed via exec() acts as a sink, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source: Decryption of hardcoded Fernet key and ciphertext; Sink: exec() of decrypted code; Flow: Hardcoded encrypted payload decrypted at runtime and executed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name, nonsensical description strings, hardcoded decryption key and ciphertext, execution of code via exec(), conditional payload execution only on Windows, syntax error in setup's cmdclass.",
  "analysis": "The script contains an obfuscated class that overrides the install command. On Windows, it imports requests and Fernet, decrypts a payload with hardcoded key and ciphertext, then executes it via exec(). The obfuscation and dynamic code execution are typical of malicious code. The setup configuration has a syntax error, but the intent is clear. The code's behavior suggests it is designed to hide malicious activity, possibly a backdoor or payload delivery mechanism. The use of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and runtime execution strongly indicates malicious intent. External reports are empty, but the code itself warrants suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential due to obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and conditional behavior on Windows. It should be flagged as malicious, with a malware score of 1, obfuscated score near 1, and a high security risk score (~0.9). The package is unsafe for use without thorough review and remediation.",
