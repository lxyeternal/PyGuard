      "conclusion": "The package contains code that exfiltrates system information during installation, which is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious in intent. There is no malicious payload like reverse shells or backdoors, so the malware score should be moderate (~0.4-0.5). The behavior warrants a high security risk score (~0.75), reflecting privacy concerns. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, the behavior is suspicious and invasive but not outright malware. The scores should be adjusted accordingly to reflect this nuanced assessment."
