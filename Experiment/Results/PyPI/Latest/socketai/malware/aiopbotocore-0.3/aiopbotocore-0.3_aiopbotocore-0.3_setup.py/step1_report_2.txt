{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python package setup configuration that installs dependencies and runs a custom post-installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads platform information from 'platform.node()' and 'platform.system()'. It also fetches the external IP address using 'requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')'.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with platform info and IP address is used in a 'requests.get()' call to send data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data flows from platform info and external IP fetch into URL construction, which is then used as the target of a GET request, transmitting system data to an external endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send' function performs an unsolicited HTTP GET request to a webhook URL, sending system identifiers without user consent or notification. The URL includes dynamic system info and external IP address, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The setup script extends the standard installation process by adding a custom command 'PostInstallCommand' that, after installation, executes the 'send' function. This function constructs a URL containing system hostname, OS, and external IP address, then makes a GET request to this URL, effectively transmitting sensitive system info to an external server. The webhook URL appears to be a placeholder (webhook.site), but in real malicious scenarios, such code could send data to malicious servers. The code does not sanitize or notify users about this behavior, indicating potential privacy invasion or malicious tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unauthorized transmission of system information to an external server during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, indicating malicious intent or privacy violation.",
