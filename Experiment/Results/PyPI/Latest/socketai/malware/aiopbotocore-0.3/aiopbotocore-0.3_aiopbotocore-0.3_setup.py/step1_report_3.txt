{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to define a Python package setup configuration with a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the system environment (platform.node(), platform.system()) and makes HTTP requests to external URLs (requests.get).",
  "sinks": "Data from sources is included in a URL and sent via a GET request to an external webhook endpoint, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "Platform information and public IP are combined into a URL and sent to a webhook endpoint through an HTTP GET request during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function executes during the installation process without user consent, sending system details to an external server. Usage of platform and requests modules is straightforward but leads to potential privacy concerns. The URL includes dynamic data that could be used for tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines a send() function that collects system hostname, OS name, and public IP, then sends this data to a specified webhook URL. A custom install command is created to invoke this send() function after installation. The setup() function configures the package with metadata and requires external packages. The code does not include obfuscated or malicious code per se but executes an external data exfiltration step during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The purpose appears to be tracking or information gathering without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a privacy-violating behavior by sending system data to an external webhook during installation, which could be considered malicious or at least undesirable. It does not contain traditional malware but performs an external data leak that could be used for malicious purposes or violate user privacy.",
