{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs a custom post-install hook.",
  "sources": "Requests to external services (https://api.ipify.org, webhook URL), platform information (platform.node(), platform.system()).",
  "sinks": "GET request to a webhook URL that includes platform info and external IP, potentially leaking system data.",
  "flows": "After installation, the send() function is invoked, which retrieves system info and external IP, then sends a GET request to a webhook URL containing this data.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install hook transmits system hostname, OS info, and external IP address to an external webhook without user consent or notification. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present, but this behavior is privacy-invasive.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup with dependencies. The custom install command extends the default to execute send(), which collects system hostname, OS, and external IP, then makes an HTTP GET request to a specified webhook URL embedding this data. This behavior can be used for tracking or exfiltrating system info without user knowledge, which is suspicious in a package context. No malware code such as reverse shells, data theft, or damaging actions is present. The data exfiltration via webhook indicates malicious intent or privacy violation.\n\nOverall, the code itself is not obfuscated, and there are no signs of typical malware. However, the privacy-invasive behavior of sending system info to an external URL during installation is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally standard setup code, but the post-install hook secretly transmits system information to an external webhook, constituting a privacy violation and potentially malicious data exfiltration. It warrants caution due to its covert data transmission behavior.",
