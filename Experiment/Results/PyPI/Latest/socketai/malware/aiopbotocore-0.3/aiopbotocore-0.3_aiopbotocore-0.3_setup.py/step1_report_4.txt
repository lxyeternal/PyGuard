{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that performs a post-installation action to send system information to an external webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' to retrieve the IP address; platform.node() and platform.system() to gather system info; external webhook URL to send data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to the constructed URL which transmits system node name, OS type, and IP address data to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data from platform.node(), platform.system(), and requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') are combined into a URL and then sent via requests.get() to the webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request to an external webhook during installation, transmitting potentially sensitive system information without user consent; no user prompt or warning is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with a custom post-install command that, upon installation, retrieves system information (hostname, OS, IP address) and immediately sends this data to an external webhook URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration without user knowledge or consent, which can be malicious. No hardcoded credentials are found, but the automatic transmission of system info to an external server constitutes a privacy violation. The code is straightforward and does not use obfuscated or malicious-looking techniques beyond the data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a privacy-invasive behavior where system data is automatically sent to an external server during installation, potentially violating user privacy. This behavior is suspicious and could be malicious, depending on context. No other malicious code or backdoors are evident.",
