{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up and install a Python package named 'aiopbotocore' with post-installation behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and fetches the external IP address using requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').",
  "sinks": "The collected data (hostname, OS, and IP address) is sent to an external webhook URL through a GET request, potentially leaking user/system information.",
  "flows": "Data from platform and requests (sources) are concatenated and embedded into a URL, which is then requested (sink), transmitting sensitive data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install 'send' function executes automatically during installation, sending system info to an external URL without user consent. The URL includes a unique identifier and appears to be used for data collection. No credentials or secrets are hardcoded, but the behavior is suspicious for a package installation routine.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and defines a custom install command that executes a 'send' function after installation. The 'send' function collects hostname, OS type, and public IP address, then constructs a URL with this data and sends a GET request to it. This behavior resembles data exfiltration. No malicious code such as reverse shells, code injection, or backdoors is present; however, the automatic transmission of system info without user awareness is suspicious. The external URL is a webhook, which could be used for tracking or malicious collection of system details. The code does not contain obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package installation but includes suspicious behavior by sending system information to an external URL without user notification or consent. This could be used for tracking or malicious purposes, indicating a potential privacy violation or covert data collection.",
