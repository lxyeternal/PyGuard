{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and executes a custom post-installation function that exfiltrates system information (hostname, OS, external IP) to an external webhook URL during installation.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to external webhook URL with embedded system data",
  "flows": "Source functions (platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get()) pass data to URL, which is requested via requests.get() to external server",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during package installation without user consent; straightforward code with no obfuscation; sending system info covertly",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup with a custom install command that, upon execution, collects system hostname, OS info, and external IP address, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a specified webhook URL. No malicious payloads such as reverse shells, backdoors, or code injection are present. The behavior is privacy-invasive, occurring silently during installation, indicating potential misuse for tracking or data collection. The code is clear and un-obfuscated. The privacy violation is significant but does not constitute traditional malware. The malware score should reflect the absence of malicious code but acknowledge the privacy breach. The risk score should be high due to covert data exfiltration, but the malware score should be moderate.\n\n",
  "conclusion": "The package contains code that exfiltrates system information during installation, which is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious in intent. There is no malicious payload like reverse shells or backdoors, so the malware score should be moderate (~0.4-0.5). The behavior warrants a high security risk score (~0.75), reflecting privacy concerns. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, the behavior is suspicious and invasive but not outright malware. The scores should be adjusted accordingly to reflect this nuanced assessment.",
