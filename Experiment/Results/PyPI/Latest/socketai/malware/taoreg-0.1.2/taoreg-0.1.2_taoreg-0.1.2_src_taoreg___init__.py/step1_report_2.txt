  "purpose": "The code defines the package version and specifies that only the __version__ variable is exported for CLI use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module '.version' to import __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Imports __version__ from a local module, then exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a relative module, then specifies exports for CLI. It appears straightforward and typical for a Python package's version management. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues. It solely manages version information and export configuration.",
