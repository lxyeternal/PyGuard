  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version import and export",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and makes it available for CLI tools by setting __all__ to include '__version__'. The implementation is straightforward, standard practice for version management, with no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version export module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
