  "purpose": "To expose the package's version information for CLI or external access.",
  "sources": "Imports __version__ from a local module (.version).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ to export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and exposes it via __all__, typical for a package's __init__.py. No data flows involve untrusted sources, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no suspicious constructs. The code's simplicity indicates benign intent, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version management snippet with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
