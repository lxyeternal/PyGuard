  "purpose": "The code imports the __version__ attribute from a local version module and defines an __all__ list to specify exports for a command-line interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a local module named .version, specifically the __version__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this code, as it does not perform any data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module and exposes it via __all__ for CLI purposes. It contains no data processing, user input, or network operations. No suspicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initialization snippet that handles version information and export declaration. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
