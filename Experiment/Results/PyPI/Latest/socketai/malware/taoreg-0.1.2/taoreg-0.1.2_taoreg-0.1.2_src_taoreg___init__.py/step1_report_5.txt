{
  "purpose": "The code imports the __version__ variable from a local version module and sets __all__ to include only __version__, likely to control what is exposed when the module is imported.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .version import __version__",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ flows into __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only handling version information; no unusual patterns or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose appears to be to expose only the __version__ attribute of the module. It imports __version__ from a local module and explicitly specifies __all__ to limit exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, standard practice for package version management, and does not contain obfuscation or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving the purpose of controlling module exports with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
