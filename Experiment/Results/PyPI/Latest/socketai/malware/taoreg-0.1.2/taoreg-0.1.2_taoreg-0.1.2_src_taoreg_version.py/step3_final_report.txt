{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package identification.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external dependencies are involved. The comments suggest a rebranding or version reset but do not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. The code poses no threat, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
