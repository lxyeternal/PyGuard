  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input, output, data flow, or external dependencies are involved.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of obfuscation are detected.\n   - The code snippets are minimal and straightforward.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present in the code snippets.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is justified.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification:**\n   - Since all analyses agree on the benign nature, the risk scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are correctly set to 0.\n   - No reason exists to elevate these scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, or external data handling.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities; they focus solely on the benign nature of the code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code snippets are standard version declarations with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is entirely benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
