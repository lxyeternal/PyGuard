  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of a version string assignment with a comment; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string value to the variable __version__, which is a common practice for package versioning. It includes a comment suggesting a reset or new naming, but this is not malicious. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version assignment statement with no malicious intent or security risks.",
