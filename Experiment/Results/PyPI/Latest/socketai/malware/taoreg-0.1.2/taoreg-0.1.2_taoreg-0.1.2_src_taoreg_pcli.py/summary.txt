  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-built registration utility for the Bittensor network. It handles sensitive data securely, performs cryptographic signing locally, and communicates with servers over HTTPS. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage is detected. The static server URLs and unused code are typical artifacts and do not elevate the security risk. Overall, the code is benign and intended for legitimate network registration purposes."
