  "purpose": "Utility for managing, backing up, and migrating the BitcoinLib database, including version checks and data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads from existing database files, user input for confirmation, and database tables during migration.",
  "sinks": "Database write operations, file move operations for backups, and user prompts for destructive actions.",
  "flows": "User input triggers backup and migration processes; data flows from source database to new database via SQL queries and object creation; version checks influence migration flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; redundant imports noted but harmless; use of input prompts for destructive actions is standard but could be misused if automated.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard database version management, backup, and migration tasks with proper error handling and safety prompts. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The data conversions and schema updates are straightforward. User prompts serve as safeguards but could be exploited if run unattended. Overall, the script is a legitimate maintenance utility with low inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured database management utility for BitcoinLib with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low risk score reflects typical operational risks associated with file and database operations, mitigated by user prompts. The code shows no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
