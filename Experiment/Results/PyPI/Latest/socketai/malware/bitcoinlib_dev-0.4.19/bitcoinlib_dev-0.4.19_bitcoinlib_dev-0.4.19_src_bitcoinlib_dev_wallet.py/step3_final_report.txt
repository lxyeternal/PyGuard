  "purpose": "Manage Bitcoin wallets, generate keys, import transactions, and send transactions using the bitcoinlib library.",
  "sources": "User input arguments, JSON transaction files, wallet methods, and generated passphrases/keys.",
  "sinks": "Print statements revealing passphrases, private keys, WIFs, transaction hashes, and transaction data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments and files provide data to wallet functions; sensitive data is generated and then printed; transactions are created and optionally broadcasted.",
  "anomalies": "Sensitive data such as passphrases and private keys are printed directly to stdout, exposing secrets insecurely.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet operations with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The main security concern is the insecure handling of secrets via print statements, which could lead to data leakage. The unimplemented '_create_multisig_wallet' is a missing feature but not a security flaw. The code relies on external libraries and user input, with no evident malicious intent. The exposure of secrets warrants a higher security risk score, but malware and obfuscation scores remain at 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate wallet management implementation with no malware or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the insecure printing of sensitive data, which increases the risk score but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
