  "purpose": "This module appears to define public API exports and executes pre-installation checks during import.",
  "sources": "Import statements for main, __version__, and run_pre_install function",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "Importing modules, then conditionally executing run_pre_install() if available",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install() during import, which could potentially run arbitrary code if the module is maliciously modified or replaced",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components such as main and version info, then attempts to run a pre-install function. The pre-install check is wrapped in a try-except block to handle missing imports gracefully. The use of __all__ suggests standard package structuring. The conditional run_pre_install() execution during import could be a vector for malicious code execution if the installer module is compromised, but this pattern is common in setup scripts. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is straightforward, primarily handling module exports and a pre-install check. While the pattern of executing code during import can be risky if compromised, there is no inherent malicious behavior in this fragment. The only potential concern is the conditional run_pre_install() which depends on the integrity of the installer module.",
