  "anomalies": "Execution of code during import, which is typical but can be risky if the module is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and attempts to run a pre-install function if present. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The pattern of executing code during import is common in setup scripts but relies on the trustworthiness of the installer module. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are detected. The risk stems from potential malicious behavior if the installer module is compromised, but no evidence of such is present. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is zero; the risk score should be low but slightly above zero due to the execution pattern, estimated around 0.2-0.3.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup pattern with a conditional pre-install hook. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The main concern is executing code during import, which could be exploited if the installer module is malicious. Overall, the code appears safe, with a low to moderate risk depending on the trust in the installer module.",
