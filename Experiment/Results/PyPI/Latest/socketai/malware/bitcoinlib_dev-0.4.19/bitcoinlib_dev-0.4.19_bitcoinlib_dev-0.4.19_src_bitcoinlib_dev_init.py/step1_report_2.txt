  "purpose": "This code sets up module exports and attempts to run a pre-install check if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'main', '__version__', and 'run_pre_install' during module import.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'run_pre_install' which could contain malicious code if compromised.",
  "flows": "Import of 'run_pre_install' -> execution during import if present.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of 'run_pre_install' without clear validation, which could be exploited if 'installer' module is malicious or altered.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module exports and attempts to execute 'run_pre_install' during import. The import of 'run_pre_install' is conditional, based on the availability of the 'installer' module. If this module is malicious or compromised, it could execute harmful code during import. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The pre-install hook could potentially be exploited if the 'installer' module is malicious, but this pattern is common in setup scripts. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module with a conditional pre-install hook. No malicious behavior or malware is evident based solely on this fragment. The risk depends on the integrity of the 'installer' module. Overall, the code appears safe but should be verified within the broader context to ensure 'installer' is trustworthy.",
