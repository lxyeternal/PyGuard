  "purpose": "Defines module exports and attempts to run pre-install checks during import",
  "sources": "Import statements: from .cli import main, from .version import __version__, and optional import of run_pre_install from .installer",
  "targets": "No explicit untrusted data sources or sinks; no input or output operations, no network or file operations",
  "flows": "Importing modules and executing run_pre_install (if available) during import",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install during import could potentially execute arbitrary code if the installer module is malicious, but this is a common pattern in package setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports and attempts to run a pre-install function if available. The run_pre_install function is imported from a local installer module and called during import. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the automatic execution of code during import, which is typical for setup scripts but warrants cautious review of the installer module itself. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this code alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package module setup with a conditional pre-install hook. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based solely on this snippet. The execution of run_pre_install during import is a common pattern in setup procedures, not necessarily suspicious.",
