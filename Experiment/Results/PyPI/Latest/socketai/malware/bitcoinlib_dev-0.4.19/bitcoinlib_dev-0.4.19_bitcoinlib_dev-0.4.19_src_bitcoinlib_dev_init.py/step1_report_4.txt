{
  "purpose": "This code imports core functions and variables, performs a pre-install check during module import, and exposes these for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module files (.cli, .version, .installer) and attempts to import and execute run_pre_install.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows to potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements and the conditional call to run_pre_install occur during module import, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to run a pre-installation check during import, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports functions and version info, then attempts to run a pre-install check by importing run_pre_install from a local installer module. This operation occurs during module import, which could be unusual but is often used for setup tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated code. The try-except block suppresses import errors, which is typical for optional features but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with a pre-install hook, common in Python packages. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on this code snippet.",
