{
  "purpose": "Define module exports and run pre-install checks if the installer module is available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules (.cli, .version, .installer)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the only dynamic action is optional pre-install check",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import and execution of run_pre_install; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; minimal and standard structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports essential components for the package's CLI and versioning. It attempts to import and run a pre-install check from a local installer module, which is a common pattern for setup scripts. The try-except block gracefully handles the absence of the installer module, preventing crashes during normal operation. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears standard and safe, primarily orchestrating package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward module initialization and optional pre-install checks with no malicious intent or security concerns. It follows typical package setup patterns without anomalies or malicious behaviors.",
