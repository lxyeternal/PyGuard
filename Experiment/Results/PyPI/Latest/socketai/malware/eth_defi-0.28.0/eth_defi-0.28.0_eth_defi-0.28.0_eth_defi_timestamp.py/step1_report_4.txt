  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve block timestamps from a Web3 provider",
  "sources": "web3.eth.get_block() calls, reading 'timestamp' field from blockchain data",
  "sinks": "Conversion of timestamp data into datetime objects, no external data sinks observed",
  "flows": "web3.eth.get_block() -> extract 'timestamp' -> convert to int -> utcfromtimestamp",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code behavior, no obfuscation, no unusual imports",
  "analysis": "The code primarily retrieves block data via web3, processes timestamp fields which can be strings or integers, and converts them to datetime objects. The timestamp handling accounts for different middleware responses. No network communication beyond standard web3 calls, no data exfiltration, no code injection, nor obfuscated constructs. The code comments indicate the functions are simple utilities, and no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard blockchain timestamp retrieval functions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It uses publicly available web3 calls and straightforward data processing. No security risks or malware are detected.",
