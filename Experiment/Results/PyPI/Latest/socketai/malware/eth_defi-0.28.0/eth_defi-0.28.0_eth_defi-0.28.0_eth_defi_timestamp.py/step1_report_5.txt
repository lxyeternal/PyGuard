  "purpose": "Provide utility functions to retrieve block timestamps from a Web3 provider",
  "sources": "web3.eth.get_block() method calls to fetch block data, reading 'timestamp' field from the block",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly; no data leaks, injections, or insecure operations observed",
  "flows": "Input from Web3 calls (block identifiers) flows into timestamp extraction and conversion functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. No suspicious code or obfuscated patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that fetch block data from a Web3 provider and extract timestamps, converting them as needed. The timestamp processing accounts for different data types (string vs integer). No external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive information hardcoded. The comments include a warning about using the function, but this is benign and related to function use, not security. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks were detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for retrieving block timestamps via Web3 with appropriate handling of data types. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
