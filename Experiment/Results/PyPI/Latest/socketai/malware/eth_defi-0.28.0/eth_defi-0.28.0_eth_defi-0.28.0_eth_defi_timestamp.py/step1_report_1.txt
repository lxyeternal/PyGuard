  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve Ethereum block timestamps using web3.py.",
  "sources": "Reading block data via web3.eth.get_block() with 'latest' and specific block identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Returning datetime objects; no direct sink for untrusted data affecting system state or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input web3 instance and block identifiers to get block data, then extract and convert 'timestamp' to datetime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches blockchain block timestamps, handling potential string or integer formats for 'timestamp'. Uses standard web3.py methods with simple type conversions. No suspicious code or malicious behavior observed. No external network activity or data leaks are present. The code relies on web3's blockchain data, which is trusted source in context, but no validation or sanitization is necessary here. Overall, it appears to be safe and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for timestamp retrieval from Ethereum blocks. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
