  "sources": "web3.eth.get_block() calls, reading 'timestamp' from block data.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of timestamp string to int, usage of datetime.utcfromtimestamp().",
  "flows": "get_block() retrieves block data -> timestamp is extracted -> converted to int -> converted to datetime.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and uses external libraries safely.",
  "analysis": "The code simply retrieves block data from the Ethereum node via Web3, extracts the timestamp, and converts it to a datetime object. There is handling for whether the timestamp is a string or integer, using a conversion function. No external untrusted input besides the block identifier is used, and no network or file operations beyond calling web3.eth.get_block(). The conversion functions are standard and the code contains no obfuscated or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic retrieval and conversion of blockchain timestamps without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and straightforward.",
