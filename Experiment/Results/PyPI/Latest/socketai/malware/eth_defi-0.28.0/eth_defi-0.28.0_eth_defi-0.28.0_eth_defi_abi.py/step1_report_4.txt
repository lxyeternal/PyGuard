It loads ABI files from disk and caches them, constructs contract instances, and provides encoding/decoding helpers. The linking function replaces placeholders in bytecode with external contract addresses based on Hardhat deployment data, which is a standard procedure in Solidity development workflows. The use of regex to replace placeholders and dynamic linking does not by itself suggest malicious intent. No network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears well-structured for legitimate purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious behavior.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a standard utility library for Ethereum smart contract interaction, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It performs file I/O, data encoding/decoding, and bytecode linking as expected in development and deployment workflows. There are no indicators of sabotage or security risks beyond normal operational assumptions.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.1\n}",
