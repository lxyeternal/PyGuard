  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading, caching, linking, encoding, and decoding Ethereum smart contract ABIs and bytecode, including contract instantiation and bytecode linking.",
  "sources": "File I/O for ABI JSON files, static ABI data, placeholder replacement in bytecode during linking, and function input parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external network calls, no data leaks, only internal processing of ABI data and bytecode.",
  "flows": "Reading ABI files from disk -> caching in memory -> constructing contract objects -> encoding/decoding function calls -> linking bytecode placeholders with deployed library addresses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of placeholder replacement in bytecode linking is standard practice; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for Ethereum smart contract interaction, including ABI loading, contract creation, encoding/decoding, and library linking. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The placeholder replacement in linking functions is typical for Solidity library linking. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs standard operations in blockchain development. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious activities are evident. The security risk and malware scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a legitimate, standard utility module for Ethereum contract interactions. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The placeholder replacement in linking is normal and not indicative of malicious intent. The low security risk scores are justified. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in production environments.",
