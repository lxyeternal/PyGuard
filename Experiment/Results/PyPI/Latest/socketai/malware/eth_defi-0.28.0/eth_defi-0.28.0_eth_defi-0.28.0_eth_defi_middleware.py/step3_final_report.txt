  "purpose": "Middleware functions for Web3.py to handle retries, error handling, signing, and caching to improve robustness and developer experience.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, exceptions, environment variables, internal cache within web3 instance.",
  "sinks": "Network requests, transaction signing, cached data, logging outputs, exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → exception/error checks → retries or cache retrieval → network request or signing → output response or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious external calls, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, error handling for known network and JSON-RPC errors, caching for static call responses, and transaction signing middleware. All patterns are typical for Web3.py middleware aimed at improving reliability and debugging. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration. The private key handling in signing middleware could pose risks if keys are compromised, but this is a common pattern in blockchain applications and not inherently malicious. The exception handling and retry logic are consistent with best practices. Overall, the code is transparent, well-structured, and aligns with legitimate use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, legitimate Web3.py middleware functions focused on retries, error handling, signing, and caching. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage detected. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
