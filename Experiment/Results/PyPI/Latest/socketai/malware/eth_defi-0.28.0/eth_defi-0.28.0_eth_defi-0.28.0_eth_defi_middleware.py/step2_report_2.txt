  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, and the consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements middleware for retries, error handling, signing, and caching, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It handles known network errors, logs retries, and caches static calls for performance.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — indicates low security risk, consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is reasonable. The code is standard, transparent, and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing retries, error handling, and debugging support. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, given the code's utility nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — very high.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate. No suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on retries, error handling, caching, and transaction signing, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard, and the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights retries, error handling, caching, and logging, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's transparent nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes middleware for retries, caching, signing, with no suspicious behavior. The code is standard and safe.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, matching the clear code structure.\n- **Risk scores:** 0.2 across reports, indicating low security risk, which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, reflecting thorough understanding and consistent findings.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — aligns with the code's functionality and low inherent risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code is a standard, well-structured set of Web3.py middleware functions aimed at improving reliability and debugging, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores reflect this assessment appropriately.",
