  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code provides middleware for retries, error handling, signing, and caching, with sources being method inputs, exceptions, and internal state.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The analysis accurately describes the data flow and the purpose of each middleware.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected. The reasoning that retries and caching are standard patterns is sound.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is legitimate and safe is well-supported, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — reasonable, as the code handles retries and caching, which could be misused if misconfigured, but overall low risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on debugging and error handling.\n- Correctly notes no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- High confidence (0.95), malware (0), obfuscated (0).\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Focuses on retry, error handling, caching, and transaction signing.\n- No suspicious external calls or malicious activity.\n- Properly states the code is standard, legitimate, and safe.\n- Confidence is high (0.95), malware (0), obfuscated (0).\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Emphasizes retry, error handling, caching, and debugging.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- High confidence (0.9), malware (0), obfuscated (0).\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- Summarizes retry, caching, signing middleware.\n- No suspicious external activity or malicious intent.\n- High confidence (0.9), malware (0), obfuscated (0).\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — justified.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2), reflecting potential misuse if integrated maliciously, but overall low.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\nBased on the code and reports, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — minimal, related to possible misuse of retries/caching but no active threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable given the code's purpose and content. No adjustments needed.",
