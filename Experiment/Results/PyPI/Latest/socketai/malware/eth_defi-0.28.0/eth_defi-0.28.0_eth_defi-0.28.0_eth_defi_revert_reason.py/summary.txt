  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate debugging utility designed to extract revert reasons from Ethereum transactions. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The main security concern is potential info leakage via logs, but this is a known trade-off in debugging contexts. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."
