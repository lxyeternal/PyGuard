{
  "purpose": "The code enforces a minimum Python version requirement for the package to ensure compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads system version information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues; the code only performs a version check.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is checked against a constant to enforce the minimum Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward and performs a simple version check with no hidden or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to access system version information. It defines a minimum Python version tuple (3, 10). The _check_python_version() function compares the current Python version with the minimum required version and raises a RuntimeError if the version is too old. The function is invoked immediately after definition. There are no suspicious behaviors, no external input processing, or data leaks. The code is standard for dependency version enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate version check to prevent running on unsupported Python versions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
