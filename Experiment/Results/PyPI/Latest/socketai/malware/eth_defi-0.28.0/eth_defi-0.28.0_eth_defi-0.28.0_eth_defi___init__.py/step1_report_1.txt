  "purpose": "To verify the Python version requirement for the package and prevent execution if the Python version is too old.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python runtime version information)",
  "sinks": "RuntimeError (raises an exception if version is insufficient)",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → comparison in _check_python_version() → RuntimeError",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs a straightforward version check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines a minimum Python version. It then checks the current Python runtime version against this minimum. If the version is too low, it raises a RuntimeError to abort execution. The code is simple and intended to enforce compatibility, with no signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic version check and does not contain malware or security risks. It is a legitimate safeguard to prevent running on unsupported Python versions.",
