  "flows": "sys.version_info (source) -> version comparison -> RuntimeError (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious logic beyond version check.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the current Python version at runtime to ensure it meets the minimum requirement (3.10). It uses standard library functions and comparison logic. The only operation is a version check, and if the version is insufficient, it raises a RuntimeError with an informative message. The code is straightforward, with no data leaks, external communications, or hidden functionalities. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple environment check to enforce minimum Python version; it contains no malware or security risks.",
