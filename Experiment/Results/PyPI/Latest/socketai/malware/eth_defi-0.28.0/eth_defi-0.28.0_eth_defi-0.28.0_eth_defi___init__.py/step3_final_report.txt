{
  "purpose": "The code enforces a minimum Python version requirement for the package to ensure compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current Python version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The source (sys.version_info) is compared to the minimum version; if insufficient, a RuntimeError is raised, halting execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple, transparent version check with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines a minimum Python version tuple, and raises an exception if the current environment's Python version is below this threshold. It performs a straightforward comparison using tuple ordering, which is reliable for version checks. The code contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. All reports correctly identify its benign purpose. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its simplicity and transparency. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the code's clarity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate, minimal environment compatibility check with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and appropriate.",
