  "purpose": "The code checks for the minimum required Python version to ensure compatibility before proceeding with package functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version information from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the version check fails, which is an internal exception handling mechanism.",
  "flows": "The source (sys.version_info) is checked against the sink (raising RuntimeError) when the version is insufficient.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code performs a straightforward version check.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to access system information. It defines a minimum Python version tuple and checks if the current Python version meets this minimum. If not, it raises a RuntimeError to abort execution. The logic is simple and standard for compatibility checks, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate environment check to enforce minimum Python version requirements. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
