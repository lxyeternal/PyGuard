  "purpose": "Define minimum Python version requirement for the package and check Python version at runtime.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python interpreter version information)",
  "sinks": "RuntimeError (raises an error if version requirement is not met)",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → comparison → RuntimeError raised if version is too low",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for version checking",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines a minimum Python version, and performs a version check at runtime. It raises an exception if the current Python version is below the minimum required. This is standard and does not involve any external data input, secret handling, or malicious activity. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version check with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply enforces a minimum Python version requirement. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
