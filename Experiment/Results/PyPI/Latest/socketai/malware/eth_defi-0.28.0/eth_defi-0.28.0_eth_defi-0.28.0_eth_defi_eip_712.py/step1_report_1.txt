{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for encoding, hashing, and signing EIP-712 structured data for Ethereum transactions and messages.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters, internal variables, and imported libraries. Uses secrets.token_bytes for nonce generation.",
  "sinks": "Signs hashes using private keys via eth_account, encodes data with eth_abi, and hashes data with Web3.keccak.",
  "flows": "Data is taken from input parameters and encoded; nonces are generated with secrets.token_bytes; payloads are hashed and signed with private keys.",
  "anomalies": "Use of secrets.token_bytes for nonce generation is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets present; no obfuscated code or suspicious network activity. The code ported from external sources appears legitimate; no suspicious code paths.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Ethereum EIP-712 signing procedures, including encoding data types, hashing structures, and signing hashes with private keys. It uses standard libraries and functions for cryptography. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic identified. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the use of secrets.token_bytes for nonces, which is secure and appropriate for cryptographic nonces. All data flows and encoding steps follow established patterns without anomalies. No network communication, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate implementation of Ethereum EIP-712 signing functions. No evidence of malicious behavior or security issues was detected. The code is well-structured and uses standard cryptographic practices.",
