{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for encoding, hashing, and signing EIP-712 structured data for Ethereum transactions.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'typed_data' dictionary for encoding and the 'private_key' for signing. Data is read from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The signing process involves the 'signHash' method from 'eth_account', which produces a cryptographic signature. No external data is written to network or file systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (typed_data and private_key) are processed through encoding and hashing functions, culminating in cryptographic signing, which produces a signature.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The private key handling correctly converts hex strings to bytes, with no hardcoded secrets. The code uses standard libraries and functions. No obfuscated or misleading code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of EIP-712 encoding and signing routines. It includes proper handling of data types, recursive type dependency resolution, and cryptographic signing using eth_account. The 'secrets.token_bytes' is used for generating nonces, which is appropriate. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The signing process is secure, provided the private key input is handled securely by the caller.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, legitimate utility for Ethereum EIP-712 signing. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage features. It follows best practices for cryptographic signing and data encoding.",
