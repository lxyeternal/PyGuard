  "purpose": "Provides functions for encoding, hashing, and signing Ethereum EIP-712 structured data, including nonce generation and cryptographic routines.",
  "sources": "Reads structured data inputs, cryptographic keys, and uses secrets.token_bytes for nonce generation.",
  "sinks": "Signs hashed data with eth_account's signHash method, producing cryptographic signatures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding and hashing functions, culminating in cryptographic signing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; use of secrets.token_bytes is standard and secure.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Ethereum EIP-712 routines with proper cryptographic practices. It uses trusted libraries, handles private keys correctly, and generates nonces securely. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The cryptographic operations follow Ethereum standards, and the data flow is straightforward. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Ethereum EIP-712 signing routines, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The cryptographic practices are sound, and the code is free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
