{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including custom commands for installation, development, and egg info generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly, but the custom_command() executes a shell command that makes HTTP requests to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "The custom_command() executes a curl command that posts an access token to an external ngrok URL, which could lead to data leakage or remote control.",
  "flows": "During package installation, development, or egg info generation, the custom_command() runs, executing a shell command that retrieves a token and sends it to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The custom_command() executes a shell command involving curl to fetch a token from Google metadata and then POSTs it to an external ngrok address; hardcoded URL and token retrieval indicate suspicious activity. The code does not sanitize or restrict this behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup process with custom commands that trigger a network request. The custom_command() fetches an access token from Google Cloud metadata server, then immediately sends this token to an external ngrok URL. This behavior suggests an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive credentials during the installation or development process. No user input or dynamic data influences this behavior, and it is embedded directly in the setup commands, which is unusual and suspicious. The rest of the code is standard setup boilerplate. The network activity triggered by setup commands constitutes a potential malicious data leak or backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious backdoor that exfiltrates access tokens during package installation or development via a hidden curl command. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent to steal credentials or maintain unauthorized access. The overall security risk is high, and the package should be considered dangerous for use.",
