      "conclusion": "The code contains a clear backdoor mechanism that exfiltrates sensitive cloud metadata tokens during package setup routines. The external URL is suspicious, and the behavior is characteristic of malicious activity. The high scores across reports are justified and should be maintained. This package should be considered malicious and avoided."
