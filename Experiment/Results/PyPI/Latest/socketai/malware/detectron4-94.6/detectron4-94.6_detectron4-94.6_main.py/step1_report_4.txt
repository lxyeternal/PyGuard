  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send this data encoded in base64 to multiple external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reads system info via platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and get_mac_addresses() which executes system commands.",
  "sinks": "Uses urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs with encoded parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses) is collected, encoded in base64, and then sent via HTTP GET requests to specified URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends potentially sensitive system data to external domains without user consent, over unencrypted HTTP connections. The URLs are suspicious and may be maliciously used for data exfiltration. The use of random numbers in URLs could be for tracking or obfuscation. The code does not handle responses or errors meaningfully, indicating stealth intent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identifiers such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are retrieved by executing system commands across different OS platforms, which is standard but used here to collect persistent hardware identifiers. The data is then base64-encoded, possibly to evade simple detection. The code then constructs multiple URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending a random number and parameters containing the encoded data. Data is transmitted via GET requests without encryption, with no response handling or validation, which is characteristic of data exfiltration or tracking activities. The code operates silently, with exception handling that suppresses errors, further indicating malicious intent or stealthy data gathering. The external URLs are suspicious and likely controlled by malicious actors.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it to external malicious domains via unencrypted HTTP requests, potentially for data exfiltration. Its behavior suggests malicious intent, with no clear legitimate purpose. The use of encoded MAC addresses and dynamic URLs points to covert operations, likely to track or identify infected systems.",
