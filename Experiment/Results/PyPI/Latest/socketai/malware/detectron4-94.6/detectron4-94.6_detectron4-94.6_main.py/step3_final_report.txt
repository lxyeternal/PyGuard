{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple suspicious domains for potential exfiltration or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), subprocess.check_output() for MAC addresses, and the random.randint() for generating a number used in URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send the encoded data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Data from system info functions flows into URL parameters, which are then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to the specified external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of suspicious domains (oast-cn, oast.fun), silent exception handling masking errors, encoding MAC addresses in base64, and the absence of any malicious payloads or destructive actions. The code retrieves MAC addresses via subprocess calls, which can be used for fingerprinting, and transmits data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers identifiable system information and exfiltrates it to obscure domains, indicating covert data collection. The data is encoded to evade simple detection. The use of silent exception handling can hide failures or malicious activity. The suspicious domains suggest potential malicious intent, such as tracking or command-and-control communication. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads, but the pattern of behavior aligns with reconnaissance or spyware activities. The data transmission occurs over unencrypted HTTP, increasing the risk of interception. Overall, the code demonstrates high potential for malicious activity centered around privacy invasion and covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of spyware or malware, primarily covertly collecting system identifiers and transmitting them to suspicious domains. While it lacks destructive payloads or obfuscation, its data exfiltration pattern and use of suspicious domains justify a high malware suspicion. The activity poses significant privacy and security risks, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.8 to 0.85. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, so obfuscated score is 0.",
