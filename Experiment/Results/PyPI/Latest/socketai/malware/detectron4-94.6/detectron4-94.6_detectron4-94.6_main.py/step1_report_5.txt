  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and send encoded MAC addresses along with other system info to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (system commands to retrieve MAC addresses), and the encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) is collected and encoded, then sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts multiple external URLs with potentially suspicious domain names; MAC addresses are encoded and sent without user consent or obvious purpose. The URLs do not appear related to legitimate services and resemble malicious or tracking domains. The usage of hardcoded URLs and encoding MAC addresses may indicate data exfiltration or tracking behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers identifiable system data, including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, which could be used to obfuscate data. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends requests to external servers. The URLs are suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating the code could be used for tracking, profiling, or data exfiltration without user awareness. The code's structure does not include any user interaction or obvious legitimate purpose for this data collection. The use of subprocess to retrieve MAC addresses varies by OS, which is standard, but combined with the external data transmission raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be collecting system information and transmitting it to external, suspicious domains without clear justification or user consent. While technically not malicious on its own, the behavior resembles tracking or data exfiltration, and the external URLs are suspicious. The code does not perform any harmful actions like damaging files or executing malicious payloads but poses privacy and security risks due to its data collection and transmission pattern.",
