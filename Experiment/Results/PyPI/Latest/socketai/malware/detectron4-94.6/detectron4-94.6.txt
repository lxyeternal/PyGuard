      "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' during installation without validation, which is a significant security concern. The pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main.py' is malicious. The reports correctly identify this risk, and their scores are reasonable. To mitigate this, such code execution during setup should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and trusted. The overall security risk is high, and caution is advised when installing packages with similar patterns."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of spyware or malware, primarily covertly collecting system identifiers and transmitting them to suspicious domains. While it lacks destructive payloads or obfuscation, its data exfiltration pattern and use of suspicious domains justify a high malware suspicion. The activity poses significant privacy and security risks, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.8 to 0.85. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, so obfuscated score is 0."
