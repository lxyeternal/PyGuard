  "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' during installation without validation, which is a significant security concern. The pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main.py' is malicious. The reports correctly identify this risk, and their scores are reasonable. To mitigate this, such code execution during setup should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and trusted. The overall security risk is high, and caution is advised when installing packages with similar patterns."
