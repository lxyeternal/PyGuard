{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to assign operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON commands.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the mcrcon.command function, which sends an 'op' command to the Minecraft server, potentially affecting server privileges.",
  "flows": "User inputs -> assign_operator function -> mcrcon.command('op {username}') -> server response indicating success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "The code directly uses user-supplied input in a command without additional validation, but this is necessary for its function. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script collects user inputs for username, server IP, port, and RCON password, then establishes a connection using the mcrcon library to send an 'op' command, granting operator privileges. The code includes error handling and logging. It does not contain any code that exfiltrates data, communicates with external servers, or performs malicious actions beyond legitimate privilege assignment. The reliance on user input for RCON credentials and server details is expected and necessary for its operation. No signs of backdoors, hidden functions, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs legitimate administrative functions for a Minecraft server, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It does not appear to be designed for malicious purposes, and its structure and logic are straightforward and consistent with intended functionality.",
