  "purpose": "The script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON protocol.",
  "sources": "Input arguments: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password; and the command response from the MCRcon library.",
  "sinks": "The command execution via mcr.command() potentially sends untrusted data to the Minecraft server; printing output and logging may expose sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input args → mcr.command(f\"op {username}\") → server executes command; Response handled for success/failure; logs and prints outcome.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated or unusual code structures; the code performs straightforward task. Sensitive data is accepted via arguments, not hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code uses user-provided input for server connection and username, then issues an RCON command to grant operator privileges. It logs connection attempts and errors. The data flow is simple, from inputs to server command. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection detected. It relies on the security of the RCON password provided at runtime. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, and third-party library usage (mcrcon) is appropriate for its purpose. Overall, the code performs a legitimate administrative function with proper logging and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility to assign operator status on a Minecraft server. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present. It securely accepts credentials at runtime. No security risks or malware are evident based on this code fragment.",
