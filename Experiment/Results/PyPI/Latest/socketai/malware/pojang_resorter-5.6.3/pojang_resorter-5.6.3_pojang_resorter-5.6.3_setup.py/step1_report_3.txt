  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'pojang_resorter' with specified dependencies, entry points, and included data files.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, specifically 'install_requires', 'entry_points', and 'package_data'.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of entry point 'pojang-resorter' script, inclusion of executable files in package data.",
  "flows": "Installation dependencies and package data are configured for runtime; entry point may execute code during installation or run.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of all '*.exe' files in 'libs' directory could be suspicious if malicious executables are packaged, but this is context-dependent. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious strings are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and data files. Dependencies appear typical for a multimedia and automation project. The inclusion of '*.exe' files in package data warrants attention, as malicious executables could be concealed here, but on its own, this is not inherently malicious. No runtime code, code injection, or network activity is present. The script itself is static and conventional, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is standard and appears benign. The only potential concern is the inclusion of executable files in the package data, which should be verified for legitimacy. There is no direct evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based solely on this configuration.",
