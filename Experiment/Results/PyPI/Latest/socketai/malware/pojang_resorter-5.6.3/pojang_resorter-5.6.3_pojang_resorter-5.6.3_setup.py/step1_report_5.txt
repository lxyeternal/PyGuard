{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data, package metadata, dependency list, and package data files; no external input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling; no code executes untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "N/A - no dynamic data flows or external data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Includes an 'include_package_data' directive to embed executable files (*.exe) from a 'libs' directory; potential concern if these executables are malicious or unnecessary, but not inherently suspicious without further context.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools, listing dependencies and package data. No code execution, input handling, or dynamic behavior is present. The inclusion of '.exe' files within package data could be unusual but is not inherently malicious; it warrants further review of those files separately. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script with an unusual inclusion of executable files in package data. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment alone.",
