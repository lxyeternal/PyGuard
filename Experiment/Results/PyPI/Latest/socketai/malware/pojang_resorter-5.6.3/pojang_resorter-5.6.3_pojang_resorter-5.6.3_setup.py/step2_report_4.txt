  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script using setuptools.\n- No evidence of runtime code execution, dynamic data flows, or external untrusted input handling.\n- The primary concern across reports is the inclusion of `.exe` files in package data, which could be suspicious if malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Each Report**\n\n**Reports 1 & 2:**\n- Both give high confidence (0.9) that the script is benign.\n- They correctly note that the setup script is standard, with no malicious behavior.\n- They mention the inclusion of `.exe` files as unusual but not suspicious without further context.\n- Malware score: 0 (appropriate)\n- Security risk: 0.2 (moderate due to inclusion of executables but not malicious)\n\n**Reports 3 & 5:**\n- Similar to 1 & 2, with confidence 0.8-0.9.\n- Recognize the inclusion of `.exe` files as a potential concern but not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly higher confidence (1.0).\n- Emphasizes that no untrusted data or dynamic behavior is present.\n- Also notes the inclusion of executable files but considers them not suspicious without further review.\n- Malware score: 0\n\n---\n\n### **Logical and Scoring Consistency**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all, consistent with the straightforward setup script.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable given the inclusion of `.exe` files, which could be a vector for malicious payloads if they are malicious, but in absence of evidence, this is a cautious but not alarming score.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Flaws or Inconsistencies**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The main point of concern is the inclusion of executable files in package data, which warrants further review outside this setup script.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the cautious approach is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment and Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Could be slightly higher if the executable files are suspicious, but without further info, **0.2** is appropriate.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- To improve security posture, verify the contents of `libs/*.exe` to ensure they are legitimate and safe.\n- If these executables are unnecessary or untrusted, consider removing them or replacing them with verified binaries.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Recommendation | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                      | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                      | Clear, straightforward setup script.                         |\n| Security Risk    | 0.2                    | Inclusion of executable files warrants caution but is not malicious. |\n\n---\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe setup code is standard, with no malicious activity detected. The inclusion of `.exe` files should be verified but does not constitute malware or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate given the evidence.",
