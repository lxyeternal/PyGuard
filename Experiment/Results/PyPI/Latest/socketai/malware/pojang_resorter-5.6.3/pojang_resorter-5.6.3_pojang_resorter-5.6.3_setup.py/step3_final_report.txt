{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines package metadata and dependencies for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package, including executable files in package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package configuration data; no external input or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the script does not process or execute external data at runtime.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of '*.exe' files in package_data is unusual and warrants external verification but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The primary concern is the inclusion of executable files, which could be benign or malicious depending on their content. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious code detected. The low security risk score (~0.2) reflects cautious acknowledgment of the executable files' presence but not an active threat. The confidence levels are high, and the assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. The inclusion of '.exe' files should be verified externally to ensure they are legitimate. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The current scores are appropriate, with a low security risk due to the executable files' presence but no malicious activity.",
