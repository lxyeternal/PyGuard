  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard. The inclusion of '.exe' files should be verified externally to ensure they are legitimate. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The current scores are appropriate, with a low security risk due to the executable files' presence but no malicious activity."
