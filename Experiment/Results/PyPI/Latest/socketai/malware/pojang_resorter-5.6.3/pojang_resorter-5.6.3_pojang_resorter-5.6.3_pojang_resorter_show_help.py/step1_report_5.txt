{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) help menu with ASCII art and colored command descriptions for a Python tool related to Mojang interaction.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine which command to display.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink of untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities. No external data processing or storage occurs.",
  "flows": "User input from command-line arguments (via argparse) influences which help message is displayed, but no further data flow or external interaction is evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code mainly focuses on displaying styled help information.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (argparse, colorama), initializes colorama, defines a function to show help with ASCII art and colored headers, and sets up command-line subcommands. All actions are limited to formatting and displaying help text. No data processing, external communications, or suspicious code behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script that uses color and ASCII art for visual appeal. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe utility script.",
