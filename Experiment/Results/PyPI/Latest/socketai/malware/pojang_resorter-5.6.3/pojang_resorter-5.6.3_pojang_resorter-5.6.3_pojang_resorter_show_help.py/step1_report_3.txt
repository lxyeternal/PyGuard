{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) with colorful ASCII art and help commands for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine subcommands.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output beyond printing help text.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line arguments) to help output, but no data flow beyond argparse parsing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ASCII art and color formatting in help display is purely cosmetic; no suspicious or malicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output and defines a function to display a help message with ASCII art and colored headers. It sets up argparse with several subcommands, each described for user assistance. There are no external data transmissions, no handling of sensitive data, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward, intended for user interaction, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This script functions solely as a CLI help interface with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not read untrusted input beyond standard argument parsing, nor does it perform any potentially dangerous operations.",
