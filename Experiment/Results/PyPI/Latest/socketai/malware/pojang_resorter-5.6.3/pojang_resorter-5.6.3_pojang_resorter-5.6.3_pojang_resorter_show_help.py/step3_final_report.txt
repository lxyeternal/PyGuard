  "purpose": "Display styled help information with ASCII art and command descriptions for a CLI tool.",
  "sources": "argparse for command-line arguments, colorama for colored terminal output",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication is processed or output",
  "flows": "User invokes the script, which calls show_help(), printing ASCII art and command options",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and only outputs static styled help text",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama, defines a function to display ASCII art and command descriptions with colors, and invokes this function in main. It uses standard libraries without dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security risks, obfuscation, or malware. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility that displays ASCII art and command options. It contains no malicious or security concerns, no obfuscation, and poses no threat.",
