{
  "purpose": "The code provides a CLI interface for a Python-Mojang interaction tool, displaying ASCII art and command options.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line arguments processed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data to external systems or performs risky operations.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow from argparse to command handling, but no sensitive data or external actions are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a function to display ASCII art and help information with colored formatting, and sets up command-line subcommands. It relies solely on standard libraries and well-known third-party modules without performing any network or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be purely for user interface purposes, with no harmful logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help display script with no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
