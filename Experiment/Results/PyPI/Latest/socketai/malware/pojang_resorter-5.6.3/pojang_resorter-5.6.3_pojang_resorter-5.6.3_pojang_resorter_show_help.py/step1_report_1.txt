{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface (CLI) with help information and command options, primarily for interacting with a Minecraft or similar server setup.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments parsed by argparse.",
  "sinks": "Display of ASCII art, command help messages, and command execution based on user input.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments (via argparse) flows into command selection and help display; no further data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of ASCII art and colored output appears for aesthetic purposes only. No dynamic execution, code injection, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes color output, defines a help display function with ASCII art, and sets up argparse subcommands for server management. It only outputs formatted text and does not handle any untrusted data beyond input parsing. No suspicious or malicious code behavior such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors is present. The code's structure is straightforward, primarily focused on user interaction with CLI help messages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, data leaks, or obfuscated behavior.",
