  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the assessments provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output.\n- Defines a `show_help()` function that displays ASCII art and command descriptions.\n- Uses argparse to define subcommands related to server management.\n- The script solely outputs styled help information; no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution occurs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended for displaying help and ASCII art. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or code injection points are present.\n- **Behavioral analysis:** The script is purely for user interface and help display.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- **Accuracy:** All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- **Details:** The reports consistently mention the absence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks, which aligns with the code's actual behavior.\n- **Potential improvements:** None necessary; the reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Notable Observations:\n- The reports consistently interpret the code as a benign CLI help utility, which is correct.\n- No report suggests any assumptions that could lead to false positives.\n- The code's structure and behavior do not justify any higher risk or malware scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores:** Given the code's straightforward nature, I agree with the current scores of **0** for all three metrics.\n- **Additional considerations:** No evidence suggests any hidden malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**The code is a harmless CLI help utility with no security concerns.**",
