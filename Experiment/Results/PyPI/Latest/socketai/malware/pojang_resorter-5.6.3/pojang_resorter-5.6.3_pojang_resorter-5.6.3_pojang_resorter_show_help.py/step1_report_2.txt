{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for a Python-Mojang interaction tool, displaying ASCII art, colorized headers, and help information for subcommands.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments through argparse to determine user commands and options.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data is written to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments flow from argparse input to command parsing and help display functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ASCII art and colored output for aesthetic purposes; no suspicious or malicious code detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes color output with colorama, defines a function to display help with ASCII art and colored headers, and uses argparse to handle subcommands. No dynamic code execution, external data retrieval, or suspicious logic present. The code solely manages user interface output and command parsing. No potentially malicious or maliciously obfuscated features identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI helper script with no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It mainly focuses on user interaction and visual display without any harmful operations.",
