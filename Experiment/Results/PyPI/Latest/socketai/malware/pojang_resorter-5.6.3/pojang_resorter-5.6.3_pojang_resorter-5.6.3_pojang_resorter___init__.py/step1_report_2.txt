  "purpose": "Provide functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, defining package metadata and importing the main function.",
  "sources": "Imports the main function from a local module (.main). Sets version and author metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package initialization file. It imports the main function from a local module, sets version and author metadata. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external connections, or potentially malicious code. The simplicity and lack of dynamic execution or data handling reduce the likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package metadata and import statements with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
