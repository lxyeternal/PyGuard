  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, likely a command-line application.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'main' function from a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import and metadata declarations; no input/output flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious functions or behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a package docstring, version and author metadata, and a single import statement. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network calls, and no potential sinks. The import is from a local module, which is typical for a package's __init__.py file. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are evident in this minimal setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only sets metadata and imports a main function, which is common for Python packages.",
