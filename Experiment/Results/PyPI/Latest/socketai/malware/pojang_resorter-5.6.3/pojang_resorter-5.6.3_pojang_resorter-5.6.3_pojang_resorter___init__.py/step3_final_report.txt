{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal package initializer, providing metadata and importing the main function for the package's CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads static metadata variables (__version__, __author__) and imports the main function from a local module (.main).",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks, network calls, or data processing; the code does not handle untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the main function to setting metadata variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package initialization module with a descriptive docstring, version and author metadata, and an import statement. It contains no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data handling. The import from a local module is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal structure and absence of suspicious code lead to a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the code's clarity and simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or scrutiny is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
