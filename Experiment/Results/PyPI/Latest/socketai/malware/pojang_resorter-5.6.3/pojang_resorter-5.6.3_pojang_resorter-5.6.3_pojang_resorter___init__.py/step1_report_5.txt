  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly by importing the main function.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local main module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only import and version/author metadata are present.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual functional code, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious operations, no obfuscated code, no external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of package metadata and a single import statement. It imports 'main' from a local module but does not execute or invoke it. There are no apparent security issues, no input handling, and no malicious behavior. The structure appears typical for a package's __init__.py or main module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module import and metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
