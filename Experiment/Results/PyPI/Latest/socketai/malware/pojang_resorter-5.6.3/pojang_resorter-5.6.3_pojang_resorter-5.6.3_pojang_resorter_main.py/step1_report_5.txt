  "purpose": "A CLI tool to execute predefined scripts or functions based on user input, mainly for server initialization, snapshots, help display, operator assignment, and server nuking.",
  "sources": "User input command and extra arguments via command-line arguments; script files located in the same directory as the main script.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing other Python scripts; importing and executing functions from external modules; logging errors.",
  "flows": "User input -> command parsing -> command mapping -> script execution or function call -> potential execution of external scripts or modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; external script execution via subprocess is flexible but potentially risky if scripts are malicious or manipulated. Importing functions dynamically from modules 'pojange_resorter.forceop' and 'pojange_resorter.nukeserver' could be risky if these modules are compromised. No input validation on arguments beyond command existence; reliance on external scripts. No evident obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a command-line interface that maps user commands to script files or specific functions in external modules. It uses subprocess to run scripts based on commands, which could be exploited if scripts are malicious or if command files are altered. It also imports functions dynamically, which could be risky if the modules are compromised. The code logs errors but does not sanitize or validate input beyond command choice. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no indicators of malicious behavior within this code segment. The script's behavior is typical for orchestrating external scripts/functions, but it assumes scripts and modules are trustworthy. The dynamic execution approach is potentially dangerous if external scripts are malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious logic but executes external scripts and modules based on user input, which could be a supply chain risk if those external components are malicious or tampered with. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent within this code snippet itself. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to reliance on external scripts and modules, but the code as provided appears benign.",
