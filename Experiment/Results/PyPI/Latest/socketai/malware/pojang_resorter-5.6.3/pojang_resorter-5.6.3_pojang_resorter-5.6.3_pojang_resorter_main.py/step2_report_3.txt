  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code acts as a command dispatcher, executing scripts or functions based on user input.\n- Commands are whitelisted, reducing arbitrary execution.\n- External scripts and modules are invoked, which could pose risks if compromised.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The \"nukeserver\" command is potentially destructive, but its implementation depends on external code.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a controlled CLI wrapper, with safety measures like command whitelisting. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** This is reasonable. The code is largely safe, with minimal risk. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on subprocess execution based on user input. Recognizes potential risk in subprocess calls but notes the command set is restricted.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Also reasonable. The main concern is the subprocess execution, but command whitelisting mitigates this. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the command dispatcher nature, with potential risks from dynamic imports and subprocess calls, especially the 'nukeserver' command. Notes that external scripts' integrity is unknown.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.4\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score is justified here due to the destructive potential of 'nukeserver' and the reliance on external scripts. The malware score remains at 0, which is consistent unless evidence of malicious code is present.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizes safe command mapping, minimal attack surface, and no malicious intent.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower risk score aligns with the code's safety profile. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the execution of external scripts and modules, noting potential supply chain risks but no malicious code within the script itself.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.4\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The external dependencies could be compromised, but the code itself appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Key points across all reports:**\n\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n- The main concern is executing external scripts and modules, which could be malicious if compromised.\n- The 'nukeserver' command is potentially destructive, but its implementation is external.\n- Input validation is minimal, but command whitelisting reduces risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior is evident within this code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — Low, given command whitelisting, but external dependencies and destructive commands warrant some caution.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\nThe code is a standard command dispatcher with minimal attack surface. The primary risks stem from external scripts and modules, which are outside the scope of this code. The destructive 'nukeserver' command, while potentially dangerous, depends on external implementation, not the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value | Justification                                                      |\n|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior present.                              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                 | Clear, straightforward code.                                         |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2               | Low risk due to external dependencies and destructive command.      |\n\nThis conservative assessment aligns with the evidence.",
