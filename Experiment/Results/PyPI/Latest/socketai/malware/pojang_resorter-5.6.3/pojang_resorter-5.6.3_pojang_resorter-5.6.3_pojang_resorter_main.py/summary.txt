  "conclusion": "The script is a well-structured, whitelist-based command dispatcher executing external scripts and internal functions. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The main security consideration is the integrity of external scripts and modules, which are outside the scope of this code. The presence of the 'nukeserver' command warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use with standard precautions."
