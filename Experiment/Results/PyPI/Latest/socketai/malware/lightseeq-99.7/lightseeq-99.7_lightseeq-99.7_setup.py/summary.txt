  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but performs a potentially dangerous action by executing 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The behavior warrants caution, and the scores should be adjusted to reflect the risk of executing external code during setup. A malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score of about 0.7 are recommended, emphasizing the need for verification of 'main.py' before trusting this package."
