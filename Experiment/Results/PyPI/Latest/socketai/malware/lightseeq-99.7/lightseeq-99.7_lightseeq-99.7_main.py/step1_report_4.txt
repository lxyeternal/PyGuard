{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information such as hostname, username, and current directory, then sends this data to multiple URLs with a random number as a parameter, potentially for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Constructed URLs with system info as URL parameters; network requests via urllib.request.urlopen send data to external servers.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) flow into URL parameter encoding, which then flows into HTTP requests sent to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domains, data exfiltration pattern without clear purpose, use of a random number in URL path, and network activity based solely on system info. No obvious malicious payload, but the pattern suggests potential data collection or tracking. No obfuscation or malicious code such as reverse shells or data theft observed.",
  "analysis": "The script collects basic system information and transmits it to third-party URLs without user consent, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. The URLs appear suspicious and are not standard package repositories. The code does not perform any harmful actions like modifying files or executing malicious payloads. The use of network requests to external domains with system info indicates potential privacy invasion. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified, but the activity is suspicious and could be part of a malicious supply chain if embedded in a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs data exfiltration of system info to unknown external domains, indicating possible malicious intent or privacy violation. No direct malicious payloads are present, but the pattern is suspicious and warrants caution.",
