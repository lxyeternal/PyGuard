{
  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs for tracking or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node() (hostname), getpass.getuser() (username), os.getcwd() (current working directory), random.randint() (random number for URL parameter).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) (sending data over the network to external servers).",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current path, and a random number) is collected from sources, encoded as URL parameters, and sent via HTTP GET request to remote URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with oast domains (commonly used for security testing and monitoring), inclusion of system info, and dynamic URL construction indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking. No apparent user consent or benign purpose. The URLs suggest a possible C2 or data collection setup.",
  "analysis": "The script collects basic system info such as hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains. It sends GET requests with these parameters, which could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The URLs are unusual and appear related to security testing or monitoring domains. The use of try-except handles errors silently. There is no evidence of malicious payload execution, but the behavior of sending system info to external domains without user consent is suspicious. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the intent appears to be covert data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code is potentially malicious as it collects and transmits system information to suspicious external domains without clear user consent. While it does not execute harmful actions directly, its behavior aligns with tracking or data exfiltration, warranting caution.",
