  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. The behavior warrants high security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments to malware scores in some reports could be made to better reflect the absence of payloads, but overall, the assessments are accurate."
