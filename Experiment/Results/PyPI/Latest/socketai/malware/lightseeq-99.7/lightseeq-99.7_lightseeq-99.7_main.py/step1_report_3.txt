  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname via platform.node(), username via getpass.getuser(), current directory via os.getcwd(), and generates a random number with random.randint().",
  "sinks": "Uses urllib.request.urlopen() to send HTTP GET requests containing system info to remote servers.",
  "flows": "Source data (hostname, username, path, random number) is encoded into URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs point to suspicious domains with obfuscated or non-standard domain parts. The code repeatedly contacts these domains, which may indicate command-and-control or tracking activities. The use of a random number in URL path suggests attempt to prevent caching or to track individual instances. No input validation or user consent appears present.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info and constructs URLs targeting suspicious domains. It sends this info via HTTP GET requests, which can be used for fingerprinting, tracking, or data collection without user consent. The domains and URL patterns raise suspicion of malicious intent. The code does not perform any harmful actions directly on the system, but the behavior of collecting and transmitting data to unknown servers is concerning. The use of try-except ensures it operates silently if requests fail.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for tracking or data exfiltration by sending system details to external servers, potentially malicious. The domain patterns and data collection method indicate suspicious activity, though no immediate system harm is evident.",
