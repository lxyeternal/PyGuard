      "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but performs a potentially dangerous action by executing 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The behavior warrants caution, and the scores should be adjusted to reflect the risk of executing external code during setup. A malware score of approximately 0.6 and a security risk score of about 0.7 are recommended, emphasizing the need for verification of 'main.py' before trusting this package."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. The behavior warrants high security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments to malware scores in some reports could be made to better reflect the absence of payloads, but overall, the assessments are accurate."
