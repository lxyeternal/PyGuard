  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious payload delivery, including remote code fetching, silent execution, and concealment. The pattern is indicative of malware or supply chain attack tactics. The scores are justified, and the overall security risk is high. It should be flagged for further review, sandboxing, or blocking."
