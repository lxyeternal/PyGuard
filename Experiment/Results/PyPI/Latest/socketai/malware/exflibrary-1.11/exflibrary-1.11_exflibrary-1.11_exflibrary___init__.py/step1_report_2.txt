  "purpose": "Import a function 'get_file' from a local module 'my_module'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'get_file' from a local module; no external input sources are explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, but the only notable aspect is the import statement, which by itself is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module. Since 'get_file' could perform any operation depending on its implementation, the security assessment of the function depends on its definition. The import statement alone does not indicate malicious behavior, but it warrants further review of 'my_module'. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present in this snippet. It’s a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent detectable here.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this single line of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard import statement. Further review of 'my_module' is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious code.",
