  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from this snippet as it only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only an import statement without context; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal code snippet importing a function from a local module. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no actions performed. The function get_file might be used elsewhere in the larger codebase, but based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, merely importing a function. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
