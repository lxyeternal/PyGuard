  "sources": "The import statement sourcing 'get_file' from the local module 'my_module'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow demonstrated; only an import statement without execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed. The code is a simple import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement importing 'get_file' from a relative module 'my_module'. There are no data inputs, user interactions, or external network calls visible. The absence of further code limits the ability to identify malicious behavior or security risks. The import itself is standard Python syntax for modular code organization.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a standard import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations or handle data that could be malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
