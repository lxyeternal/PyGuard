  "conclusion": "The import statement is safe and does not indicate malicious behavior. The risk and malware scores are appropriate, and no obfuscation is present. The main security concern lies in the implementation of 'get_file' within 'my_module', which is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code is benign, and the current scores reflect that accurately."
