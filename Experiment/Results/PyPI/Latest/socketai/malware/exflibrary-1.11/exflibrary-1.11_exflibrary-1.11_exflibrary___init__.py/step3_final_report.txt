  "purpose": "Evaluate the security implications of the import statement 'from .my_module import get_file' in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; potential data flow depends on 'get_file' implementation in 'my_module'.",
  "sinks": "Execution environment where 'get_file' is invoked; potential for data leakage or malicious actions if 'get_file' is malicious.",
  "flows": "Importing 'get_file' from 'my_module' (source) to its usage point (sink); actual flow depends on how 'get_file' is used in the codebase.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the import statement; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of 'get_file' from 'my_module'. On its own, this line is benign and common in modular Python projects. No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The security risk and malware scores are zero, reflecting the lack of evidence for malicious intent. The overall risk is minimal, with a score around 0.1, acknowledging that the security implications depend on the implementation of 'get_file' within 'my_module'. Since no further code or context is provided, the assessment remains conservative. The confidence score is high (close to 1) that this snippet is benign, but the final security posture depends on the content of 'my_module'.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is safe and does not indicate malicious behavior. The risk and malware scores are appropriate, and no obfuscation is present. The main security concern lies in the implementation of 'get_file' within 'my_module', which is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code is benign, and the current scores reflect that accurately.",
