  "purpose": "Importing the 'get_file' function from a local module named 'my_module'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module file 'my_module'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; only an import statement without further code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no suspicious or unusual constructs are present. Cannot determine if 'my_module' contains malicious code without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing 'get_file' from a local module. No input reading, data processing, or output occurs here. Given only this line, there are no signs of malicious behavior. The security implications depend entirely on the content of 'my_module'.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no indications of malicious intent. It is a typical module import with no observable security issues. However, without examining 'my_module', a complete assessment cannot be made.",
