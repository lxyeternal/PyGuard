{
  "purpose": "Importing a function named 'get_file' from a local module 'my_module'.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports code from a local module; no external input is read here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible with only an import statement; no runtime data flow exists in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual features. The imported function's behavior is unknown without its implementation, but the import statement itself is benign.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only imports a function from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall security risk cannot be determined without examining 'get_file' and the module 'my_module'. However, based solely on this import statement, there are no indicators of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import operation with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. No malicious behavior or anomalies are detectable in this minimal snippet.",
