  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and contains no malicious logic. The suspicious description indicates potential misuse but does not reflect actual malicious activity within the code. Malware score should be 0; risk score should be higher (~0.6) to account for the malicious intent implied by the description. Scores in prior reports undervalue the risk; a cautious but accurate assessment aligns with these recommendations."
