  "purpose": "Define the package metadata and dependencies for the 'exflibrary' Python package.",
  "sources": "None, as the code primarily consists of package setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data processing or untrusted data handling routines.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, since the script only specifies package setup information.",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states 'Library for malware building, educational purposes only', which is suspicious. However, the code itself does not contain malicious logic or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package, using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies. The description field raises suspicion as it claims the package is for malware building, which is inherently malicious. Despite this, the code itself does not execute any malicious activities, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No input sources or sinks are present; it merely specifies package info.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration with a suspicious description indicating malicious intent, but lacks any actual malicious code or behavior within this snippet. The risk lies more in the purpose suggested by the description than in the code content itself.",
