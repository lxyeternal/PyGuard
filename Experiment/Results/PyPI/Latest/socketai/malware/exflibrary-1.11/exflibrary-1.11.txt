      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and contains no malicious logic. The suspicious description indicates potential misuse but does not reflect actual malicious activity within the code. Malware score should be 0; risk score should be higher (~0.6) to account for the malicious intent implied by the description. Scores in prior reports undervalue the risk; a cautious but accurate assessment aligns with these recommendations."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious payload delivery, including remote code fetching, silent execution, and concealment. The pattern is indicative of malware or supply chain attack tactics. The scores are justified, and the overall security risk is high. It should be flagged for further review, sandboxing, or blocking."

      "conclusion": "The import statement is safe and does not indicate malicious behavior. The risk and malware scores are appropriate, and no obfuscation is present. The main security concern lies in the implementation of 'get_file' within 'my_module', which is outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code is benign, and the current scores reflect that accurately."
