  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "None, as the code only imports and exports a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; very minimal code with straightforward import/export",
  "analysis": "The code imports AbstractSender from a local sender module and exposes it via __all__. There are no functions, no data processing, no user input, and no external data flows. The code is standard module export code, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that exposes a class for external use without any suspicious activity or malicious intent.",
