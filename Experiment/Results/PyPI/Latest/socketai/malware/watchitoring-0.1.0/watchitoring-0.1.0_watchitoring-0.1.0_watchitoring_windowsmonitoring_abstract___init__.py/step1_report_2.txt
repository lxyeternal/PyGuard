{
  "purpose": "This code defines the public API of a module by exporting AbstractSender from the sender package.",
  "sources": "No input data or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and exports a class name.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AbstractSender from a relative module sender and sets the __all__ list for module exports. It appears to be a standard module initialization pattern. There are no signs of malicious code, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The simplicity indicates it is likely part of a larger project and does not perform any malicious activities by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely manages module exports with no data processing or external interactions.",
