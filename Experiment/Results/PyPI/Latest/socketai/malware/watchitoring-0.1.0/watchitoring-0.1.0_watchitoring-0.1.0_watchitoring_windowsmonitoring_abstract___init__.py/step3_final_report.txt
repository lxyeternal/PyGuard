  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports a class from a relative module and exposes it via __all__. It contains no data flows, external data sources, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and standard. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the analysis. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
