{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define an export for the module, specifically exposing the AbstractSender class for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports AbstractSender from a relative module named sender.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; this code only imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module and exposes it via __all__, which is typical in Python packages for controlling module exports. There are no external data sources, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior. The simplicity indicates no malicious intent or security issues within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward module definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard package code intended for modular design.",
