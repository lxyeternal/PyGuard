  "purpose": "Platform detection and conditional import of platform-specific monitoring modules in a cross-platform Python application.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call for OS detection; local module imports for MacMonitoring, WindowsMonitoring, initialize_system_monitoring, InputMonitor.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines OS, influencing conditional import of WindowsMonitoring; other modules are imported unconditionally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward platform check using platform.system(), then conditionally imports WindowsMonitoring if on Windows, while always importing MacMonitoring, initialize_system_monitoring, and InputMonitor. The structure is standard for cross-platform modules, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All imported modules are local, and the code only exposes them via __all__. No data flows, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The code is clear, simple, and aligns with typical cross-platform setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, performing standard platform detection and module imports without any malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores indicating no malware, obfuscation, or security risk are accurate and justified.",
