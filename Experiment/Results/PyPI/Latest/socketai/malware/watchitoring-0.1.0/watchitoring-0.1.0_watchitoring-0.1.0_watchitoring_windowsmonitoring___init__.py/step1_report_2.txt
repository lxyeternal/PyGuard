{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an __all__ list for module exports, facilitating controlled public API exposure for a Python package related to Windows monitoring and utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication; the code only performs imports and defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data handling; the code solely manages module namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code structure is standard for module __all__ declaration and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and variables from local modules, then defines __all__ for module export control. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded secrets, no input handling, and no suspicious functions or network operations. All imports are from local modules, indicating standard modular structure. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initialization script with standard import and export definitions. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
