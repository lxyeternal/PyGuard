{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a module's public interface by importing specific classes and enums from internal modules, likely for use elsewhere in the larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads from internal modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations such as network communication, file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports classes and variables to expose them publicly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward, following standard import and export conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious data handling. It serves as a module interface declaration without performing any runtime operations or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface setup without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any code that could be used for malicious purposes. The overall security risk is negligible.",
