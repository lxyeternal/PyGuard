{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or API exposure point, importing specific classes and enums from internal modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Local module imports: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external communication, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export module with no dynamic behavior, network activity, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No suspicious data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present. The code's purpose is purely organizational, facilitating access to internal classes and constants. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and security profile.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module that imports internal components and exposes them via __all__. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
