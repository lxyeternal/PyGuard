  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that re-exports classes and constants from local package modules for easier access.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks detected in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted inputs identified; the code only performs module imports and __all__ declaration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs observed; code is straightforward module re-export",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes and constants from internal modules and defines the public API with __all__. No runtime data processing, external inputs, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure indicates standard package organization. Without additional context, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard module initializer, re-exporting symbols. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
