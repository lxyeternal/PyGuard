{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module import and export declaration for a Python package, likely organizing components related to Windows monitoring and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, and .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data handling points are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules and exports identifiers; no data flow, processing, or source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code structure is typical for Python package __init__.py files.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and constants from local modules and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. It functions as a package initializer or module aggregator, which is common practice and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module import/export setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks identified.",
