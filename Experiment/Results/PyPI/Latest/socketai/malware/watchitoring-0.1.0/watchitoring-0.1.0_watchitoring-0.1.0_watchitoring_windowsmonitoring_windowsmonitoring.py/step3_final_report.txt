{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a Windows data stealer and monitoring tool, collecting browser credentials, cookies, history, bookmarks, extensions, system info, screenshots, and other process data, then exfiltrating this information via a Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments, embedded modules (e.g., browser data, system info), and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Collected data is stored in zip archives and sent over the network through the Telegram bot sender, with data also stored locally in memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from collection modules (e.g., Chromium, Dscr, Steam) into zip files and previews, then is transmitted via the Telegram sender; network context is modified to bypass SSL verification; silent exception handling suppresses errors.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a hardcoded Telegram bot token, disabling SSL verification (`ssl._create_unverified_context`), broad try-except blocks that suppress errors, and use of multiple surveillance modules without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly collects sensitive user data and system information, uses a hardcoded Telegram token for exfiltration, disables SSL verification to potentially intercept or manipulate network traffic, and suppresses errors to operate stealthily. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation, indicating intentional malicious design. The embedded credentials and data exfiltration routines are classic indicators of malware. The code’s behavior aligns with known spyware or data-stealing malware, with high potential for covert operation and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a highly malicious, non-obfuscated data-stealer and surveillance tool, designed for covertly collecting and exfiltrating sensitive user data via a Telegram bot. The embedded credentials, data collection modules, SSL bypass, and silent error handling confirm its malicious intent. The malware and security risk scores should be set at maximum levels, reflecting its high threat level.",
