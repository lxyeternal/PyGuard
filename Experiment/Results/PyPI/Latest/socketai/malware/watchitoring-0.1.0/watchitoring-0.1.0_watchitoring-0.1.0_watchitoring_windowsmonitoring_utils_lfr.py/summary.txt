  "conclusion": "The script is straightforward but poses significant security risks due to silent download and execution of arbitrary files, especially with shell=True and no validation. It can be exploited for malicious activities such as executing malicious payloads without user awareness. The current scores of malware (~0.75) and risk (~0.75-0.8) are justified; the code itself is not malicious but highly exploitable."
