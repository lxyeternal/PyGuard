{
  "purpose": "The code initializes platform-specific system monitoring by starting monitoring threads for input and system metrics based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS, instantiation of monitoring classes (MacMonitoring, WindowsMonitoring, InputMonitor), and thread start methods.",
  "sinks": "Thread target functions (start_monitoring, run) which execute monitoring routines.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines OS, then threads invoke respective monitor methods to perform monitoring activities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic; monitoring functions are standard and expected for system monitoring tools.",
  "analysis": "The script detects the OS and starts monitoring threads accordingly. It imports specific classes for Mac and Windows monitoring and runs their respective methods in separate threads. The code appears to be for legitimate system monitoring without any suspicious or malicious activity. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate platform-specific system monitoring initialization. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard monitoring setup code.",
