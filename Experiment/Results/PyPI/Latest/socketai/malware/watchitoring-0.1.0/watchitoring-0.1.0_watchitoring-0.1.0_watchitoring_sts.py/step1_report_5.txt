  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system and input monitoring using threading.",
  "sources": "platform.system() to determine OS; instantiation of InputMonitor(), MacMonitor(), WindowsMonitor().start_monitoring(), .run() methods.",
  "sinks": "Threads executing monitor start methods; no direct untrusted data sinks or external network communication.",
  "flows": "platform.system() → threading.Thread(target=InputMonitor().start_monitoring) and threading.Thread(target=MacMonitor().run / WindowsMonitor().run); no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no obfuscated code, no data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system, starts input and system monitoring in separate threads, and dynamically imports platform-specific modules. The approach appears standard for monitoring tools. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and the code structure is straightforward. It appears to be intended for legitimate system monitoring purposes, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical platform-specific system and input monitoring initialization script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
