  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific monitoring threads for macOS or Windows systems.",
  "sources": "platform.system() to determine OS, threading.Thread to spawn monitoring threads, InputMonitor().start_monitoring() to monitor input.",
  "sinks": "Thread targets invoking monitoring methods (MacMonitor().run, WindowsMonitor().run, InputMonitor().start_monitoring). No direct untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "platform.system() reading OS type -> threading.Thread invoking monitoring functions -> threads executing platform-specific monitoring.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of threading is standard for monitoring tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports platform-specific monitoring classes and spawns separate threads to run these monitors. It uses platform detection to decide which monitoring to activate. All monitoring functions are invoked as thread targets, which is typical for system monitoring applications. No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears to be designed for legitimate system monitoring purposes without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code initializes system monitoring threads based on the detected OS. It functions as a monitoring launcher and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
