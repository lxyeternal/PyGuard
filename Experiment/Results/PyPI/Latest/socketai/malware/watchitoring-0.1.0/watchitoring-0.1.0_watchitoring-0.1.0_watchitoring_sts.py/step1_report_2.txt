  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection, InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input monitoring, MacMonitor().run and WindowsMonitor().run for platform-specific monitoring.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code only starts monitoring threads; no data is sent externally or stored directly.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines platform; starts input monitoring thread; conditionally starts OS-specific monitoring thread.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or malicious code present; dynamic thread creation is standard; no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system using platform.system(), initiates an input monitor thread, and starts a platform-specific system monitor thread based on OS. All actions are limited to starting threads for monitoring purposes without any data exfiltration or malicious behavior. The imported modules suggest system monitoring functions for Mac and Windows, but their internal implementations are not provided. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code appears to be part of a legitimate monitoring tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation to start platform-specific monitoring threads. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
