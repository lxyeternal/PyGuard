  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a cross-platform system monitoring library called 'watchitoring'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; imports 'setuptools' functions for setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or external calls beyond package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads static file -> executes setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; all code is standard setup script for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package configuration, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and conditional extras. No user input, network activity, or executable code execution occurs. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure and content are typical for a Python package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
