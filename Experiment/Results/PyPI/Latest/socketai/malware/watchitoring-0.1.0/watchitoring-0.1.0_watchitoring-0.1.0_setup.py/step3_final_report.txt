{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of the 'watchitoring' Python library, specifying metadata, dependencies, and optional platform-specific requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies defined in code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Static configuration without dynamic data flow; no source-to-sink data paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, standard, and free of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, reading a static README file, defining package info, dependencies, and optional extras. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling. Dependencies are common for system monitoring tools. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. All signals indicate a benign, standard configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis. The code poses no security threat.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
