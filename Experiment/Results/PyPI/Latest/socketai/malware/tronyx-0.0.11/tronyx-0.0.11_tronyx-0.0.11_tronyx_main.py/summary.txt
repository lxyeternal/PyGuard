  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high security risk primarily due to insecure transmission of private keys and potential for malicious remote control. The misuse of data structures indicates poor coding practices but does not negate the security concerns. The pattern aligns with credential exfiltration or backdoor mechanisms. The overall malware score should be approximately 0.75-0.8, with a security risk score around 0.85, and obfuscation score 0."
