  "purpose": "Send transaction data containing a private key to a remote server and retrieve switcher status.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'private_key', data in 'transaction_data' list, responses from requests.get and requests.post.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URL endpoints which could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "private_key -> transaction_data -> requests.post -> external server; switcher.json() -> conditional logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a set instead of a list for 'transaction_data' which may cause unintended data structure behavior; sending sensitive 'private_key' over network without encryption or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'perm' that takes a private_key, packages it into a set (which is unusual and potentially problematic), then sends it via a POST request to a remote API endpoint. It then makes a GET request to check a switcher value, which influences the return value. The transmission of a private key in plain text to an external server is a significant security concern. The use of a set to hold 'transaction_data' is likely an error, but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. There are no obfuscations or malicious code patterns such as reverse shells or data exfiltration beyond the private key transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to intentionally send a private key to an external server, which could be malicious or a severe security risk if used improperly. The use of a set instead of a list for 'transaction_data' may be a bug, but the main concern is the leakage of sensitive data. No other malicious behaviors are detected, but the handling of sensitive data is insecure.",
