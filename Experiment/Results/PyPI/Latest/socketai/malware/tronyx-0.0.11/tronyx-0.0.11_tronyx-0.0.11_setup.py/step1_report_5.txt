  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tronyx' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing 'setuptools' and 'pathlib' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or sensitive operations identified.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file content during setup, passing package metadata to 'setup()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the README.md content for long description, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and URL info. No external data input, network connections, or executable code beyond standard package setup procedures. Usage of 'setuptools' and 'pathlib' is standard. No suspicious or malicious behaviors found.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code performs typical package configuration tasks without any malicious logic.",
