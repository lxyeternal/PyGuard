  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script.\n- No untrusted data, dynamic code execution, or network activity is present.\n- The only external URL is a GitHub repository link, which appears legitimate.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code simply reads a README file and defines package metadata.\n\n**Specific Issue Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the original code provided.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code snippets.\n- The dependency list is minimal ('requests'), which is common and benign.\n- The package metadata is static and straightforward.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 1 with confidence 1, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- Since no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected, the malware score should be 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall security risk is negligible, so the security risk score should be 0.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n- The only point to reconsider is the malware score. Some reports assign it as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is justified given the consistent analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll evidence indicates this is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The overall risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should be **0**.",
