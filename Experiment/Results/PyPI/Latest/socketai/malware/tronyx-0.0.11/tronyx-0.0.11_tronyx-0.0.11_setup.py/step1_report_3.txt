  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'tronyx' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and repository URL.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file from the current directory to obtain long description; reads static strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external system interaction within the code.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no unusual code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, reads the README.md for the long description, and defines package metadata including dependencies and repository URL. No user input or untrusted data sources are involved. No code injection, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The code follows standard Python packaging conventions without obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
