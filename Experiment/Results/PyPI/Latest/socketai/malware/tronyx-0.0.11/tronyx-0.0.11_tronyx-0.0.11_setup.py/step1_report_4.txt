{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'tronyx' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package dependencies ('requests'); reads package metadata such as name, version, author, email, license, and project URL.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No untrusted data handling, no external inputs processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or external communications. The code only loads static data and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The setup script appears straightforward. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The only external link is to a GitHub repository, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup utilities, reads the README file for detailed package description, and calls setup() with package metadata and requirements. No code injection, dynamic code execution, or network activity occurs here. The dependencies are explicitly listed. The script only prepares package metadata and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies are present.",
