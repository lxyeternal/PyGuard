  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'tronyx' Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md for long_description; hardcoded package metadata (name, version, author, etc.); reading dependencies ('requests'); reading project URL.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script primarily reads static files and defines package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, reads a README file for the package description, and defines package metadata including name, version, author info, dependencies, and project URLs. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or network activity occurs. The code follows standard packaging conventions and does not contain suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares the package metadata for distribution.",
