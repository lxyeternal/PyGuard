  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'perm' from a local module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No data flow; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; the only unusual aspect could be if the import is from a malicious or compromised local module, but this cannot be determined from the snippet alone",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement. This does not by itself pose any security risk or malicious behavior. There are no input sources, data processing, or network interactions. The import is from a relative module, which is standard in package code. Without additional context or code, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal part of a Python module.",
