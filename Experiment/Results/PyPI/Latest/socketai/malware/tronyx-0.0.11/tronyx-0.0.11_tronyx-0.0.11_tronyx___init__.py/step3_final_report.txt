{
  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object/function from a local module 'main' within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak information.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; as this is a static import with no data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward relative import with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement, which is standard in Python modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import is from a local module, and no data flows, network activity, or external interactions are present. The minimal code and lack of anomalies suggest a benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the context. No further analysis or action is warranted based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores and assessments across the reports are consistent and justified.",
