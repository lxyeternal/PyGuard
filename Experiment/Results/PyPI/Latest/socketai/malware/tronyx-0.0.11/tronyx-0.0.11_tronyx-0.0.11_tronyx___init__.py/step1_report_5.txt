  "purpose": "The code imports the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'perm' from the local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "Potential usage of 'perm' elsewhere in the project (not shown here), which could be a sink if 'perm' is used unsafely.",
  "flows": "Not enough code provided to determine any data flow. The current snippet only shows an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple import statement importing 'perm' from a local module 'main'. There is no logic, no data processing, or network activity visible. Without additional context or usage, it is not possible to identify malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears benign and typical for Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a basic import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to be malicious or maliciously sabotaged based on this minimal code fragment.",
