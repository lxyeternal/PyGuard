  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'perm' from a local module; no direct data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be performed based solely on an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a relative module, which is standard practice in Python projects. There are no visible security issues, malicious behaviors, or anomalies in this snippet. As it is a minimal import statement, it does not interact with external data, execute untrusted code, or contain obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The code appears benign and typical for Python modules.",
