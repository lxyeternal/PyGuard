{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'systoring', including metadata and dependencies, primarily for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description; it also specifies dependencies for installation and optional platform-specific dependencies.",
  "kills": "No code in this script executes untrusted data; no network operations or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script only defines package metadata and dependencies; there are no source-to-sink data flows related to untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setup practices with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup operation, importing 'setuptools', reading a README file, and configuring package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It specifies platform-specific extras for Windows and macOS. There are no dynamic code executions, no input validation or processing, and no network activity. It appears to be a benign configuration script for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies without executing any untrusted or malicious code.",
