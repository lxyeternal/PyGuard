  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'systoring', including its metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are present; dependencies are specified with version constraints, and no code executes dynamic or unsafe actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README file into the setup parameters; no other significant data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package configuration, reads a markdown README for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. All dependencies are version-restricted and serve typical purposes. The script is a standard package setup configuration without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.",
