  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific monitoring threads for macOS or Windows, along with input monitoring.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection, InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input data",
  "sinks": "External modules' run methods, threading for concurrent execution",
  "flows": "platform detection -> thread creation for input monitoring and system monitoring based on OS",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward platform detection and initiates monitoring threads using external modules. No malicious patterns, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. External modules' trustworthiness cannot be assessed, but the code itself appears benign. The threading approach is standard, and no suspicious data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign platform-dependent monitoring setup with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. External modules' integrity remains unverified, but based on this snippet, the code is safe.",
