{
  "purpose": "Initialize system monitoring based on the platform (macOS or Windows), starting input and system-specific monitoring threads.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; InputMonitor().start_monitoring() in a thread; platform-specific monitor's run method in separate threads.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; threads invoke external monitoring functions, but no direct data sinks or leaks are evident in this fragment.",
  "flows": "platform.system() output influences which monitoring thread is started; input monitoring runs in its thread; OS-specific monitoring runs in its thread.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; code uses standard threading and platform checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection via platform.system() and starts input and system-specific monitoring threads accordingly. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious data handling, or malicious behavior detected. The monitoring functions invoked are from external modules, but their implementation isn't provided. The threading approach is standard for concurrent tasks. Overall, the code appears to be a typical system monitoring setup without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code initializes platform-dependent monitoring and input capture in separate threads. No malicious activity, suspicious data handling, or security risks are apparent in this fragment.",
