  "purpose": "Initialize and start system monitoring threads for macOS or Windows platforms.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS, InputMonitor().start_monitoring(), and platform-specific monitor's run methods.",
  "sinks": "Threads executing monitor start functions; potential for untrusted code execution if monitor implementations are malicious.",
  "flows": "platform.system() output → conditional branch → threading.Thread targeting monitor methods → thread start.",
  "anomalies": "Use of threading without validation of monitor implementations, but no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the OS platform and starts input monitoring and system monitoring in separate threads. It relies on imported modules, which appear to be legitimate monitoring classes. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are visible within this snippet. The code's structure is straightforward, and it primarily delegates to external modules for functionality. The threading usage is typical for such monitoring tasks. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscated code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard system monitoring initialization code for macOS and Windows, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
