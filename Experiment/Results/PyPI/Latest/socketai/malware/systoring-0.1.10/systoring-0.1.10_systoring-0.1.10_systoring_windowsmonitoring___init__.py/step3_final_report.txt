{
  "purpose": "Module initializer exporting classes and enums for package API",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions present",
  "flows": "Import statements and __all__ assignment, with no dynamic or data flow activities",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py module that imports specific classes and enums, then defines __all__ for exports. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code structure is typical for package API exposure. The imported modules could contain malicious code, but this snippet shows no evidence of malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The confidence levels are high, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initializer with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
