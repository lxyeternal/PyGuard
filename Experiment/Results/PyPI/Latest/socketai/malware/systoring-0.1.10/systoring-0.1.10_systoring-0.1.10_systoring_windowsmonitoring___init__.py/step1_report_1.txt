{
  "purpose": "Define and export a set of modules, enums, and utility classes for a larger application, likely related to Windows monitoring and utilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; import statements are static and do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. No dynamic code execution, no external network calls, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be part of a module's __init__.py file for organized package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard module import/export setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any sensitive operations, and there are no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
