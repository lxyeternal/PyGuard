{
  "purpose": "Defines module exports for Windows monitoring and utility classes/enums",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; merely imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration, establishing public API exports. There are no data processing, external communications, or logic that could be malicious. The modules imported could contain malicious code, but within this snippet, nothing malicious is evident. The structure appears standard for a Python package __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a standard module initializer with no malicious behavior detected. It simply re-exports classes, enums, and functions for use elsewhere. No malware or security risks identified based on this code alone.",
