{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and specific objects for use in a larger Python project, likely related to system monitoring and utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only imports and defines __all__",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; no execution of external input or untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected; simple import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and the definition of __all__, which specifies the public API of the module. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could be malicious. The modules imported are likely part of the package, and their usage would need review separately. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module initializer that imports components for use elsewhere. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
