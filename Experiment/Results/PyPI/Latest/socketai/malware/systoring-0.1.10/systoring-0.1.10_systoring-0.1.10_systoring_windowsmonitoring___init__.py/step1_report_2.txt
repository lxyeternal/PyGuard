{
  "purpose": "Define module exports for Windows monitoring and utility classes/enums",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data handling or network operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import statements are static and do not process untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns; simple module export declarations",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific classes and enums from local modules and sets the __all__ list for exports. No input processing, no network activity, and no suspicious logic are present. The structure is typical for a Python package __init__.py file. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module initializer that declares exports for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
