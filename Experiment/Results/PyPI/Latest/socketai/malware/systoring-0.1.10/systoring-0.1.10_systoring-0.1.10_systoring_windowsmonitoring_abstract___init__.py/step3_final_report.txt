  "purpose": "Module exposes AbstractSender class from a local sender module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender module, specifically reading AbstractSender.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only imports and exports a class.",
  "flows": "Import of AbstractSender from .sender; export via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for module interface.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import and exposes the class via __all__, with no dynamic execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
