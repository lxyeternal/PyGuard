  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data processing, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; minimal code with standard import and export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a relative module and declares it as part of the module's public API. There are no dynamic code executions, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The import statement is standard for package modules. The code is minimal and appears to serve as an interface or abstract class declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module definition exporting an abstract class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in this snippet.",
