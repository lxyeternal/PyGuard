{
  "purpose": "The code defines an import of 'AbstractSender' from a relative module and exposes it via __all__ for public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code only performs an import and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module import and export",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or object named 'AbstractSender' from a sibling module and sets the __all__ variable to expose 'AbstractSender'. There are no input sources, no data processing, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious code behavior. The code appears to be a standard Python module setup intended for API exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up the module's public API with an import statement.",
