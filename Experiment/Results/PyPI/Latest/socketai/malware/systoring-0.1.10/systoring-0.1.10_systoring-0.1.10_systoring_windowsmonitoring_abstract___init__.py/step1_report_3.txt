  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports a class and defines an export list. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code appears to serve a simple purpose of defining an interface or abstract class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module to expose an abstract sender class. No malicious or security concerns are identified based on this snippet.",
