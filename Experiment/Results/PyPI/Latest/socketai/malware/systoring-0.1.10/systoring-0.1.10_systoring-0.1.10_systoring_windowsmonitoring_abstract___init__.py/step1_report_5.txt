  "flows": "No data flows or data handling processes observed",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies or suspicious patterns identified",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named AbstractSender from a local module sender and declares it as part of the module's public API via __all__. There are no data inputs, outputs, or data handling logic. The code appears to be a simple module export statement with no embedded malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module defining and exporting a class, with no evidence of malicious or security-threatening behavior in this snippet.",
