{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing specific classes from sibling modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only imports and exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with static imports and an __all__ list. It contains no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing. The imported modules could theoretically be malicious, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest benign intent. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
