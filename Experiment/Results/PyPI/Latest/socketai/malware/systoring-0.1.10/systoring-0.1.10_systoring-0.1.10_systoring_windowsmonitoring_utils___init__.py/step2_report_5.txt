  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code verification**: The original code snippet is straightforward, performing static relative imports of classes from sibling modules and defining an `__all__` list for export. There are no dynamic elements, no user input, no network activity, and no obfuscation. Based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Logical consistency of reports**: All reports agree that the code is simple, benign, and standard for module initialization. They consistently state that there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores assessment**:\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any malicious indicators.\n   - **Security risk score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports suggest any suspicious or malicious activity that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is purely static import/export, with no dynamic or external data handling.\n\n5. **Potential issues or assumptions**:\n   - While the reports mention that the imported modules could potentially contain malicious code, there is no evidence in this snippet. Without inspecting the actual modules, we cannot assume malicious intent.\n   - The code's purpose appears to be purely structural for a package.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores**:\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- Given the analysis, I agree with the provided scores.\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard module initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
