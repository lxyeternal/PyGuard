{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module imports and defines an export list. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The imported modules could potentially contain malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply imports and exports specific classes.",
