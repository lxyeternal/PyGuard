{
  "purpose": "The code is used to import specific classes from local modules and define what is exported for external use, likely part of a larger package or module.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data handling or output functions observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward relative imports of classes from sibling modules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It is standard module setup code with no external data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of import and export statements typical for Python modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
