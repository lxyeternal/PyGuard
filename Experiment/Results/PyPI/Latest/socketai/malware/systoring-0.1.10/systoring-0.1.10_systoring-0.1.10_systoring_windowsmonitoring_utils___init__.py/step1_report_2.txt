{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from relative modules and defines an export list for a package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current directory's modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely imports modules and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes from sibling modules and exposing them via __all__. It appears to be a typical module setup with no malicious logic, data handling, or suspicious behavior. There is no network activity, data manipulation, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is simple and clean, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and exports classes for use elsewhere.",
