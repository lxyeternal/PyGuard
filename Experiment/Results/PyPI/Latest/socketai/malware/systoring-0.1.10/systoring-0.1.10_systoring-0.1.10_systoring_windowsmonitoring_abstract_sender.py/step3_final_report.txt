  "purpose": "Defines an abstract sender class template for data transmission, including SSL configuration handling.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; abstract methods imply data retrieval from subclasses.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; data transmission occurs via abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "flows": "Data flows depend on subclass implementations; the only notable flow is the SSL context modification via _create_unverified_https().",
  "anomalies": "The method _create_unverified_https() disables SSL verification globally, which is a security concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard abstract class designed for extension, with a method that disables SSL verification globally. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or active malicious behavior are present. The SSL bypass can be exploited if misused but is a common pattern in development or testing environments. The reports correctly identify the security risk but do not attribute malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is absent. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3-0.4) due to the SSL bypass potential misuse. Overall, the code is benign but should be used cautiously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate infrastructure template with a security concern regarding SSL verification disabling. No malware or obfuscation detected. The main risk is potential misuse of the SSL bypass method, but it does not constitute malicious activity.",
