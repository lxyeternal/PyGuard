  "conclusion": "This code poses a significant security risk due to its ability to download and execute arbitrary files without validation, combined with unsafe subprocess invocation and silent error handling. While not inherently malicious, its potential for misuse is high, warranting a malware score of 0.75 and a security risk score of 0.8. It should be flagged for high caution, and improvements such as validation, sanitization, and avoiding shell=True are recommended."
