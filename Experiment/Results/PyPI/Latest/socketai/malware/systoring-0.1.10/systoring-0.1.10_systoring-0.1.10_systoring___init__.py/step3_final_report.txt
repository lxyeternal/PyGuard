  "anomalies": "None; straightforward platform detection and static imports",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple OS check and imports modules accordingly. No dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The logic is standard for cross-platform modules, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The import pattern is standard, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate but could be lowered to zero for risk, given the benign nature.",
