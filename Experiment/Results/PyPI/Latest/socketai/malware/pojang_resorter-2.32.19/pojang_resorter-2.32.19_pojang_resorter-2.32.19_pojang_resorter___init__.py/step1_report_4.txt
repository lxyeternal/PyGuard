  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, hidden code, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a local module, assigns version and author metadata, and contains only comments. There are no input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure appears standard for a package's __init__.py or main module, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. It primarily provides package metadata and imports necessary functions for the CLI tool.",
