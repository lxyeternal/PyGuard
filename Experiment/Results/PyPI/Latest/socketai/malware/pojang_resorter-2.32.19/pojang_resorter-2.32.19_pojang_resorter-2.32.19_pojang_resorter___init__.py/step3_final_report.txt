  "purpose": "Minimal package initializer defining metadata and importing main function",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module (.main), metadata variables (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network activity, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Import from local module, setting metadata variables",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package module with minimal content: a docstring, an import from a local module, and metadata variables. No data flows, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The import is from a relative module, typical for package entry points. All security signals are absent, and the code's simplicity indicates benign intent. The reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious behavior, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and very low security risk scores justified by the minimal code. The confidence in these assessments is high, given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package entry point with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
