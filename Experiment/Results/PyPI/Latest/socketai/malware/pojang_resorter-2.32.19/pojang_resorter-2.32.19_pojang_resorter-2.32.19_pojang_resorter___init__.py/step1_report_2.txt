  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only module-level variable assignments and an import statement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports a function and sets metadata variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module-level documentation, imports, and version/author metadata. No input handling, no data processing, no network communication, nor any suspicious code structures. The import statement references a relative module 'main', but without additional context, it appears standard for a package's entry point. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup with metadata and an import statement, showing no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe based on this snippet.",
