  "purpose": "The script acts as a command-line interface to execute specific Python scripts based on user commands, mainly for server initialization, preview, help display, and operator assignment.",
  "sources": "Input source: command-line arguments (via argparse). Data read from sys.argv through argparse.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external scripts via subprocess.run(). No data is returned or written externally from the command execution; logs are written to a file.",
  "flows": "User input (command argument) -> execute_command_script() -> subprocess.run() to execute other scripts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The script executes other scripts based on command mapping, which could be risky if the scripts are malicious or if command mapping is tampered with. No evident obfuscation or malicious code present. Logging errors are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code parses command-line arguments to determine which script to run. It has a predefined command map for executing specific scripts located in the same directory. If no command is provided, it defaults to 'initialize_server'. The subprocess call runs another Python script, which could be malicious if the scripts themselves are malicious, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior. No user input is evaluated or executed directly, minimizing injection risk. The script logs errors but does not handle or sanitize the content of the scripts it runs. Overall, the script functions as a dispatcher to run other scripts based on user input.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious behavior or malware. It functions as a command dispatcher that invokes other scripts based on user input. The primary security concern would depend on the nature and trustworthiness of the scripts being invoked, not on this script directly. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious code are evident within this code snippet.",
