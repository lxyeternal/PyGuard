  "purpose": "A command-line interface dispatcher that maps user commands to specific scripts and executes them.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line arguments; script existence checks in the same directory.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external scripts via subprocess.run based on user commands.",
  "flows": "User provides command -> command is mapped to script name -> script existence is verified -> script is executed via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward command mapping and execution. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, transparent command dispatcher that restricts commands via argparse choices, reducing injection risk. It checks for script existence before execution, logs errors, and defaults to 'initialize_server' if no command is provided. The main security concern is reliance on external scripts, which could be malicious if compromised. The code itself contains no malicious payloads or obfuscation. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis. The overall risk is low but depends on external script integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, well-structured command dispatcher with minimal inherent security risks. The primary concern is ensuring the external scripts it executes are trustworthy. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
