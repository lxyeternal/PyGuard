{
  "purpose": "Decodes and executes a base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload that is reversed before decoding.",
  "sources": "Input data is embedded in the variable passed to the lambda function, which is a base64-encoded, zlib-compressed byte string.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decoded payload, which could perform any malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The code reverses the payload string, base64-decodes it, decompresses it with zlib, and then executes the resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "The payload is heavily obfuscated: reversed string, base64 encoding, zlib compression, and dynamic execution. This obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The payload content is hidden until decompression and decoding, making static analysis difficult.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a lambda function that imports zlib and base64 modules to decode and decompress a payload string. It reverses the string, decodes from base64, decompresses, and then executes the resulting code via exec(). The payload string is long, appears to be randomized or encrypted, and is hidden behind multiple layers of obfuscation. The use of exec() on dynamically decoded data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially since the code is designed to hide its true content. The obfuscation techniques used—string reversal, base64, compression—are common in malicious scripts to evade detection. No benign purpose justifies such obfuscation and dynamic code execution without explicit documentation or safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to heavy obfuscation and the use of exec() on dynamically decoded data. It is likely intended to execute malicious payloads hidden within the encoded string. Static analysis suggests malicious behavior, and the obfuscation indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
