{
  "purpose": "Decode and execute a base64-encoded, zlib-compressed payload, likely intended for obfuscated malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The input string passed to the lambda function (_), which is base64-encoded and reversed.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the decompressed code, which may lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system.",
  "flows": "The code reverses the input string, decodes it from base64, decompresses it with zlib, and then executes the resulting code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscation techniques such as string reversal, base64 encoding, zlib compression, and dynamic execution (exec). The payload is heavily encoded and compressed, making analysis difficult. No clear purpose or benign functionality is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a lambda function that imports zlib and base64 modules to decompress data. It then immediately executes a decompressed payload. The payload is stored as a base64 string, reversed, and then processed. This pattern is characteristic of malicious obfuscation intended to hide the true behavior. Since the payload is executed directly, it could perform any malicious action, such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, designed to evade static analysis and conceal payload purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its obfuscation and use of dynamic execution. It likely contains malicious payload that, when decompressed and executed, could perform harmful activities on the system. It should be treated as malicious with high confidence.",
