  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) help message for the Pojang Resorter tool.",
  "sources": "Input is from command-line arguments ('command').",
  "inks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only prints help information.",
  "flows": "User input ('command') is processed by argparse to display help, but no actions are executed based on the input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions; no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to display help information using argparse, which is standard for CLI tools. It only processes command-line arguments to show help and does not perform any other actions or data processing. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are present. There are no external data reads or network interactions. The structure and logic are typical for a CLI help module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
