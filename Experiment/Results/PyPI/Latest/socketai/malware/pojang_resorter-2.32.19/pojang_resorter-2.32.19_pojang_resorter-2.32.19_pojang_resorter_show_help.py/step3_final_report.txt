  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface help utility for a tool named 'Pojang Resorter', displaying available commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine which command to display help for.",
  "sinks": "The code only outputs help information; no data sinks or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Input: command-line arguments; Output: printed help message; No data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, using standard libraries with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes an argparse parser with a description, adds a positional argument 'command' with specific choices, and prints help information when run. It does not process or execute commands, connect to networks, or handle untrusted data beyond argument parsing. The code is simple, transparent, and uses standard Python libraries. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI help utility with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports correctly identify its purpose and security posture. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
