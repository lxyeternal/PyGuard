  "purpose": "Provide a CLI help message for the 'Pojang Resorter' tool with commands like screenshot, botserver, do-snapshot, and help.",
  "sources": "argparse.ArgumentParser() initialization, parser.add_argument() method, and parser.print_help() call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or harmful commands are executed.",
  "flows": "User input (command argument) is used to specify commands, but it is only for displaying help, not executing any commands or commands leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual code behavior observed. The code solely creates a help interface.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that initializes an argument parser with specific command choices and displays help information. There are no input processing or command execution steps beyond help display. No network activity, data manipulation, or malicious code is present. The structure is straightforward and typical for CLI help commands. There are no anomalies indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves only to display help information for a CLI tool. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
