{
  "purpose": "The code defines a command-line interface (CLI) tool for 'Pojang Resorter' with a help display function.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line input via the argparse module, specifically the positional argument 'command'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data beyond reading input, nor does it perform any unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line argument 'command' flows into the argparse choices but is only used to display help; no further processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and standard; there are no unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up an argparse parser with a description and a single positional argument 'command' with predefined choices. The 'show_help' function initializes the parser and calls print_help(). The main block calls this function, resulting solely in displaying help information. There are no external data reads, network connections, or code execution beyond standard help printing. No obfuscation or malicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign CLI help script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides usage instructions for a CLI tool named 'Pojang Resorter'.",
