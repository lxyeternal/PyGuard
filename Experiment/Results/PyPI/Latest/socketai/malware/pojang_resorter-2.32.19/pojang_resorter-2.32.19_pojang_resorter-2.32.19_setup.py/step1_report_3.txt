  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'pojang_resorter' Python application, specifying dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads package requirements from 'install_requires', gathers package information via 'find_packages()', and defines console script entry points.",
  "sinks": "N/A — the setup script does not process untrusted input or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable — this code primarily defines metadata and dependencies without data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. All dependencies are common Python packages related to GUI automation, image processing, and HTTP requests.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It specifies dependencies such as 'requests', 'pyautogui', 'discord.py', and others, which are typical for GUI automation and network operations. No code execution, input handling, or malicious constructs are present. The package appears intended for legitimate use involving automation, image processing, and network communication. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a typical packaging configuration with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. All dependencies are standard, and the code follows conventional practices. No malicious or maliciously suspicious code was identified.",
