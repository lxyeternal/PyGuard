{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'pojang_resorter' that specifies dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'install_requires' list for dependencies, from 'entry_points' for command-line scripts, and from the initial import statement for setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink operations; the script only defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script does not process external data at runtime; it only declares static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. All dependencies are common for automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing purposes. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py file is a standard configuration script used for Python packaging. It imports the 'setuptools' module, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points, and specifies Python version compatibility. All dependencies listed are typical third-party libraries for automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing. The script does not include any code execution, data handling, or network activity beyond declaring dependencies. No malicious patterns such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a conventional setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security issues. It merely declares package information, dependencies, and entry points. There are no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
