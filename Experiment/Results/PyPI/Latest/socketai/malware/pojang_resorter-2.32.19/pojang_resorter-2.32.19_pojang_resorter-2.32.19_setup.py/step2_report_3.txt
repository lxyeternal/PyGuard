  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malware. Dependencies are common for automation and image processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Standard setup with dependencies that could perform network or system operations, but nothing suspicious. No malicious intent evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, standard setup with typical dependencies. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard setup. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but justified given the dependencies could invoke external code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. No malware, just a small potential security concern due to dependencies.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard setup, dependencies typical for automation. No suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of the overall evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated setup script.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report (Report 4) assigning 0.1 due to potential external code invocation risks. This is reasonable given the dependencies involved.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Should remain at 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** The one report with 0.1 is justified; others should stay at 0.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The setup script is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The dependencies, while capable of network or system operations, are common and used legitimately.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (except for Report 4, which is justified at 0.1)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the standard practices observed.",
