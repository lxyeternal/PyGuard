  "purpose": "Obfuscated runtime code for licensing or anti-tamper protection using PyArmor.",
  "sources": "Import from 'solana_account_sdk.pyarmor_runtime_000000' and embedded binary data passed to __pyarmor__.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Import -> __pyarmor__ call with binary data; no external data flow or malicious activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with embedded binary payload; typical for licensing but conceals behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a PyArmor runtime module and calls __pyarmor__ with embedded binary data, characteristic of code protection tools. Static analysis shows no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious functions. The obfuscation and binary payload are consistent with licensing or anti-tamper mechanisms. All reports correctly identify the purpose and lack of malicious activity. Malware scores are zero; obfuscation scores are high (~0.8-0.9); security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2). The heavy obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent based on static evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate PyArmor license or anti-tamper protection code, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is typical for such tools and does not inherently suggest malicious intent. Static analysis supports a benign assessment.",
