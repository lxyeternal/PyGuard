      "conclusion": "The code shows patterns that could be exploited maliciously but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. Scores are appropriately cautious, with malware scores around 0.2–0.3, obfuscation around 0.2–0.3, and moderate security risk scores (~0.3–0.4). Further detailed code review is recommended to confirm or refute suspicious patterns."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of an obfuscated or protected script using Pyarmor. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The high obfuscation score in one report should be adjusted downward, but overall, the assessments are accurate. The code poses no security threat."
