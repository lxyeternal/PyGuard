  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the user via input() functions, and environment variables are accessed through os.environ. No external network sources or files are explicitly read in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data is printed to the console using print(). Environment variables are accessed but not transmitted or stored elsewhere.",
  "flows": "User input and environment variables are read and used within the script but do not flow into any dangerous functions or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. No dynamic execution or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic input reading and environment variable access, with standard print output. No network communication, file manipulation, or other potentially malicious operations are present. The structure and formatting are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or complex logic that could hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The script appears benign and follows standard programming practices.",
