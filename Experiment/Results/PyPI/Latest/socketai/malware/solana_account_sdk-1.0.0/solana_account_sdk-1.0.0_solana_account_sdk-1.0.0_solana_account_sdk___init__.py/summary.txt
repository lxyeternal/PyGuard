  "conclusion": "The code shows patterns that could be exploited maliciously but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. Scores are appropriately cautious, with malware scores around 0.2–0.3, obfuscation around 0.2–0.3, and moderate security risk scores (~0.3–0.4). Further detailed code review is recommended to confirm or refute suspicious patterns."
