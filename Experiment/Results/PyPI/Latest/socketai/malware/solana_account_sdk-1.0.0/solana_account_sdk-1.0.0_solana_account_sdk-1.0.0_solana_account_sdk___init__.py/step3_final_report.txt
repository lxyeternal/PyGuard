  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, environment reads, network calls, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, imports.",
  "sinks": "Console output, file writes, network communication, environment variables, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user input flow into potential sinks like network or file operations, possibly via eval/exec or dynamic imports.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, eval/exec, obfuscated variables, dynamic imports, suspicious URLs, environment variables, and network functions without confirmed malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns such as environment variable usage, dynamic execution, and network activity that could be exploited maliciously. Several reports note suspicious patterns like hardcoded secrets, eval/exec, obfuscation, and network calls, but lack concrete code snippets confirming malicious intent. Reports 1 and 5 show moderate suspicion, with some obfuscation and dynamic code usage, but no definitive malicious actions. Reports 2 and 3 are benign, with no suspicious patterns detected. Report 4 is incomplete, limiting certainty. Overall, the suspicion is moderate, but no direct evidence of malicious activity is confirmed. The scores should reflect suspicion without overestimating threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows patterns that could be exploited maliciously but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. Scores are appropriately cautious, with malware scores around 0.2–0.3, obfuscation around 0.2–0.3, and moderate security risk scores (~0.3–0.4). Further detailed code review is recommended to confirm or refute suspicious patterns.",
