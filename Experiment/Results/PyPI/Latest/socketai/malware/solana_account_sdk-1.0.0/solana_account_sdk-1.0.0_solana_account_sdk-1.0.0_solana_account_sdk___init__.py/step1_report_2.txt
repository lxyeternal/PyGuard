{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data outputs such as printing or writing to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env variables) through processing functions to sinks (outputs, network, or system modifications).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network calls or dangerous eval/exec statements are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including all functions, variable assignments, and control flow. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining behaviors were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed. The code structure suggests standard functionality with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activities detected.",
