  "purpose": "Generate and format Solana wallet account information from mnemonic phrases.",
  "sources": "User inputs mnemonic phrase length; Mnemonic.generate() for mnemonic words; function parameters (_dpath, _debug).",
  "sinks": "None evident; data is formatted and returned, no external transmission or sensitive data exfiltration shown.",
  "flows": "Mnemonic generation -> seed derivation -> keypair creation -> data formatting and output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; standard usage of libraries. No suspicious code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a mnemonic phrase of specified strength (12 or 24 words), derives a seed, and creates a Solana keypair with optional derivation path. It formats keypair info into a dictionary, optionally prints debug info. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The process appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for generating Solana accounts from mnemonics, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard cryptographic operations and data formatting, and does not contain malicious or suspicious code segments.",
