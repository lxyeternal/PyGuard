{
  "purpose": "Generate and format a Solana keypair and address from a mnemonic phrase.",
  "sources": "User-provided mnemonic input via function parameter, internal mnemonic generation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposed keypair information such as public address, key bytes, or base58 string.",
  "flows": "Mnemonic input → seed derivation → keypair creation → data formatting → output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code; no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a mnemonic phrase (either user-provided or generated), derives a seed, creates a Solana keypair, and formats key data for output. All operations are standard cryptographic procedures with no suspicious code or backdoors. The code does not send data over the network, store sensitive info insecurely, or execute obfuscated logic. The use of third-party libraries appears legitimate and consistent with common practices for blockchain key management. The debug option exposes key data in JSON format, which could be sensitive if misused, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of mnemonic-based keypair generation for Solana. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The primary concern is exposure of sensitive key data if debug mode is enabled in an insecure environment.",
