{
  "purpose": "Generate and format Solana keypair and account information from a mnemonic phrase.",
  "sources": "Input: Mnemonic phrase generated within the create_account function; External libraries providing cryptographic functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as mnemonic words, seed, and public key output. No direct data leakage or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Mnemonic generated -> seed derived from mnemonic -> seed used to create Keypair -> public key and address extracted -> formatted and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of cryptographic libraries appears standard. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code generates mnemonic phrases, derives cryptographic seeds, and creates Solana keypairs using standard libraries. The formatting function includes debug printing, which is typical. No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The code does not transmit data externally or perform any harmful actions. It appears to be a straightforward key generation utility for Solana wallets.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a mnemonic-to-Keypair generator for Solana, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard cryptographic practices and does not include suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
