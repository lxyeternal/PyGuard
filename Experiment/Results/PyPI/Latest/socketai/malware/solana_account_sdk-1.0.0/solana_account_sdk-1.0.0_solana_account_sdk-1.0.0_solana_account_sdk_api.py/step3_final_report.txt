{
  "purpose": "Generate a Solana wallet mnemonic, derive seed, create keypair, and format account info with optional debug output.",
  "sources": "Mnemonic generation, seed derivation, keypair creation, optional debug print of sensitive data.",
  "sinks": "Debug print outputs potentially sensitive key data; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Mnemonic -> seed -> keypair -> formatted data; debug print outputs sensitive info if enabled.",
  "anomalies": "Debug mode exposes private key data; use of external 'decorator' without implementation details; no obfuscation or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic wallet generation using well-known libraries. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The only security concern is debug output that could leak private keys if enabled in production. The 'decorator' usage is benign given no evidence of malicious intent. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential risk of debug info exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for wallet generation, with a minor security risk related to debug output. No malicious activity or supply chain threats are detected. The scores are appropriate and align with the analysis.",
