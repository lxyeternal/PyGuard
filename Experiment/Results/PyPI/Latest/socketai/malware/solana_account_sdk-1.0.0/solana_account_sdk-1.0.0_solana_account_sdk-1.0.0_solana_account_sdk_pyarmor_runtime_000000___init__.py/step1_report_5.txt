  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module for code obfuscation or licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely imports a module",
  "anomalies": "The comment indicates use of Pyarmor trial version; no suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected in the import statement itself",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single comment and an import statement for a local module __pyarmor__ within the pyarmor_runtime package. The comment suggests that this code is part of a Pyarmor-protected or obfuscated script, potentially used for licensing or licensing enforcement. No other code or dynamic behavior is present. The import is standard and does not imply malicious intent; it simply loads the runtime component necessary for Pyarmor's obfuscation or licensing features.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a minimal fragment of a Pyarmor-protected script, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It only imports a runtime module, which is typical for obfuscated code that uses Pyarmor. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks within this snippet.",
