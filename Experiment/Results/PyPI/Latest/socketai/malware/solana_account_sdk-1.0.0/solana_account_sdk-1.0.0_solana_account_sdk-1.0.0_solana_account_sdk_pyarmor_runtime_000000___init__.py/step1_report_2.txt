  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module for code obfuscation or license management.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime import __pyarmor__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; import statement itself is benign",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; just an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating Pyarmor trial version, but no suspicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module, along with a comment about Pyarmor version. Pyarmor is a legitimate obfuscation tool, and this code appears to be part of a larger obfuscated package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The import is standard and benign, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement related to Pyarmor, a legitimate obfuscation tool. There are no indicators of malicious activity or security risks within this code fragment.",
