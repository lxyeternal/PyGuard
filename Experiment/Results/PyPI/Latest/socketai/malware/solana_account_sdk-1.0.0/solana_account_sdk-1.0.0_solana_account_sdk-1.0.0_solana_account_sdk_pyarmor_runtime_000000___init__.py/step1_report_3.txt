{
  "purpose": "The code imports a runtime module for Pyarmor, a tool used to protect Python scripts via obfuscation and licensing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.pyarmor_runtime' for '__pyarmor__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be part of a protected or obfuscated environment. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment with version and trial info, and a single import statement for a runtime module related to Pyarmor. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The presence of a Pyarmor runtime is consistent with script protection, not malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import of a runtime module used for script obfuscation protection. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
