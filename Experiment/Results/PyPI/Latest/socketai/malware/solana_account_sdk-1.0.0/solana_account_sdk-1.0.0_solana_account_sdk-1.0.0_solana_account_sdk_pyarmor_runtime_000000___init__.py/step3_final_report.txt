  "purpose": "Importing a runtime module for Pyarmor, used for obfuscation/license management.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "Import statement; no data flow from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, only a comment and an import; no anomalies or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import of a local module related to Pyarmor, with a comment indicating a trial version. No data flows, network activity, or malicious code are present. The import is typical for protected scripts, and the comment is benign. The obfuscation score assigned in some reports (notably 0.8) appears overstated given the minimal code; a lower score (~0.2) is more appropriate. Malware scores are correctly zero, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk is very low, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as part of an obfuscated or protected script using Pyarmor. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The high obfuscation score in one report should be adjusted downward, but overall, the assessments are accurate. The code poses no security threat.",
