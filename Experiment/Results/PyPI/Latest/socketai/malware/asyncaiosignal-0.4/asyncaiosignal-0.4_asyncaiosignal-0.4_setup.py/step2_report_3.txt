  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code review:**\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` configuration for a Python package named \"asyncaiosignal.\"\n   - It specifies a list of dependencies with exact versions, which appears typical for ensuring reproducibility.\n   - No suspicious or malicious code is present; it is a straightforward package setup.\n\n2. **Report content:**\n   - All five reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no raw response data.\n   - There are no details about any issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Implications:**\n   - Since the reports are empty, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - The absence of detailed reports makes it impossible to identify any flaws or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores and reasoning:**\n   - Given the lack of information, the malware score should be **0**, indicating no evidence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as there's no indication of code obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be **0** because there's no demonstrated or suspected security concern.\n\n5. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not provide any evidence or reasoning; thus, any suspicion would be purely speculative.\n   - It is important to base scores on concrete evidence rather than empty reports.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no reason to suspect any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores should be adjusted to reflect this lack of evidence.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports do not contain any information to support concerns about the package. The code appears standard and benign. Therefore, no issues are present, and all scores should be zero.",
