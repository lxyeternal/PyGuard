{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'asyncaiosignal' Python package, specifying dependencies and package inclusion.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'install_requires' list for dependencies and the 'find_packages()' function for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data could be in dependency versions or package data, but none are present here; no sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dependency specifications and package discovery to the installation process; no malicious or suspicious flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present in this straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with explicit dependency versions and package inclusion. All reports are empty, providing no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The dependencies are well-known packages, and the code structure is standard. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are detected. Given the lack of evidence, the package appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The empty reports do not indicate any problems. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
