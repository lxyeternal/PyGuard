  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, functioning as a keylogger and data theft malware with covert exfiltration via Telegram. It employs hardcoded credentials, disables SSL verification, and silently handles errors, all typical of malicious surveillance tools. The overall security risk is extremely high, and the malware score should be set to 1.0."
