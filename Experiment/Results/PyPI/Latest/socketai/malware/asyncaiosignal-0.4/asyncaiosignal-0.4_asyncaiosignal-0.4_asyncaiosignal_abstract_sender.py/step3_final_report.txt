  "purpose": "Template for the sender class, providing abstract methods for data retrieval and transmission, and a static method to disable SSL verification.",
  "sources": "The static method _create_unverified_https() which disables SSL certificate validation.",
  "sinks": "None directly; potential misuse of the SSL bypass could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks if exploited.",
  "flows": "The static method sets the default HTTPS context to an unverified one, affecting all subsequent HTTPS connections in the process.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a method that globally disables SSL verification, which is insecure if used improperly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with methods for data handling and a static method that disables SSL verification. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The SSL bypass method is a security concern but not malicious by itself. The code is straightforward and intended for extension. The main risk is potential misuse of the SSL verification bypass, which could be exploited in production environments. No signs of supply chain malware or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template with a notable security concern in the SSL bypass method. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk stems from the potential misuse of the SSL verification disabling method, which should be used cautiously. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.35, reflecting the potential for exploitation without active malicious intent.",
