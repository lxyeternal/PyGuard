  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template with a notable security concern in the SSL bypass method. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk stems from the potential misuse of the SSL verification disabling method, which should be used cautiously. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.35, reflecting the potential for exploitation without active malicious intent."
