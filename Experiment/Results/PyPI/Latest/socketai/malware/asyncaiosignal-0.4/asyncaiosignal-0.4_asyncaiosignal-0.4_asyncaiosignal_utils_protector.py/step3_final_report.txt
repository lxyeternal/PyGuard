{
  "purpose": "The code implements anti-analysis and anti-debugging measures by checking system processes, MAC address, hostname, user, registry keys, network responses, and file existence to detect virtual machines, debuggers, or environment manipulation.",
  "sources": "System process list, MAC address via getnode, environment variables (computername), network URL responses, registry keys, file paths, system info (video card).",
  "sinks": "Network requests for environment validation, registry queries, process enumeration, process termination via exit().",
  "flows": "Source data (system info, network responses, registry values) flow into conditional checks; if suspicious conditions are met, the process terminates.",
  "anomalies": "Use of network requests with random strings for environment checks; no obfuscation or malicious payloads; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection techniques common in anti-debug/anti-VM modules. It checks process lists, MAC addresses, hostname, user, registry keys, and network responses to identify virtualized or debugged environments. No malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Network requests are used for environment validation, not malicious communication. The code is clear, non-obfuscated, and aligns with legitimate anti-analysis practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.2), justified by its purpose but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard anti-analysis/anti-debugging module with no malicious intent. It employs common techniques for environment detection without malicious payloads or exfiltration. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
