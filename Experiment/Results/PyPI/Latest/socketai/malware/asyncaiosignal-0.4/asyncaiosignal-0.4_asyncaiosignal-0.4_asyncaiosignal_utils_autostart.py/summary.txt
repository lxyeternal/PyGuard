  "conclusion": "The code exhibits persistence and stealth tactics typical of malware, such as copying files to autostart, hiding files, and modifying Defender exclusions. While no malicious payload is present, these actions can be exploited for malicious purposes. The behavior justifies a moderate to high security concern, but the absence of direct malicious code suggests a malware score around 0.3 and a risk score approximately 0.55. The code should be reviewed carefully before deployment in sensitive environments."
