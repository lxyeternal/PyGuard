  "purpose": "This code defines a module that imports specific classes from local submodules and exports them as a public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .autostart, .message, .loader, .protector, .grabber",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data handling or external interactions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving sources to sinks are observable in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, only importing and exporting classes with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from local modules and defines an export list. No external data input, no data manipulation, no network interactions, no cryptographic operations. It appears to serve as an index or interface for other modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected based on this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module re-exporter with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and standard for organizing package modules.",
