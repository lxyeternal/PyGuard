{
  "purpose": "This code is primarily exporting modules related to autostart, messaging, loading, protection, and grabbing functionalities, likely as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .autostart, .message, .loader, .protector, .grabber",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing is visible in this snippet; potential sinks would be in the imported modules",
  "flows": "Not applicable in this snippet; flow analysis depends on imported modules and their usage elsewhere",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes from internal modules and defines the __all__ list for export. No data input, output, or execution logic is present in this fragment. It appears to be a standard module interface file with no signs of malicious behavior. Since it only manages module exports, the suspiciousness is minimal; however, the security assessment depends on the content of the imported modules, which are not provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module export declaration with no evident malicious intent or security risks within this fragment. Its safety depends on the content of the imported modules, which cannot be assessed here.",
