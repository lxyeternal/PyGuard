  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports several classes for use in a larger project, likely related to process automation or system interaction.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are present; this code only performs module exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; only standard import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for local modules and an __all__ declaration to define public exports. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or network communications. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules that organize multiple classes.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet alone, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard module export file, with no suspicious code, inputs, or outputs.",
