  "purpose": "This code defines an __all__ list for a Python module, exporting specific classes from local modules for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads only its own module files for imports and the __all__ list definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or harmful actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing and listing class names; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module __init__.py pattern, listing classes to be exported. It imports classes from local modules and defines __all__ for package exports. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious behavior, and no security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, typical module initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
