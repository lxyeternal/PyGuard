{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing specific classes from local modules and defining the __all__ list for export.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only references local module classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py pattern, importing classes and defining __all__. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware scores of 0 and security risks near zero. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features support a benign assessment. The only caveat is that imported modules could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The scores are consistent with the benign nature, and confidence levels are high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module initialization file with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
