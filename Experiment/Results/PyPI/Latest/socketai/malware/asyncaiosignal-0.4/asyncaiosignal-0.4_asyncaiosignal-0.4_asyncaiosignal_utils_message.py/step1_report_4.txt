  "sources": "Import of windll from ctypes, reading message configuration from MessageConfig.",
  "sinks": "windll.user32.MessageBoxW function, which displays a message box.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Message object -> call to run() -> call to __create_message_window() -> MessageBoxW displays message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code constructs; the message is faked but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses ctypes.windll to invoke Windows API for displaying a message box, using configuration data from MessageConfig. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The try-except block suppresses exceptions without handling, which is benign but may hide errors. The purpose is to show a fake error window, which is typically used for prank or UI purposes, not malicious intent. Overall, no malicious or maliciously disguised code behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code displays a fake error message window without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign script intended for user interface simulation or prank purposes. No suspicious activities are present.",
