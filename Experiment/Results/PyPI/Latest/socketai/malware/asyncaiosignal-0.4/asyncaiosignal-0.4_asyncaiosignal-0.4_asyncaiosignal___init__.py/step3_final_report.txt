{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or API interface, importing specific classes and constants from internal modules and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.ms, .enums, .utils) reading module components; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; purely static import/export statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module setup, importing classes and constants from internal modules and defining __all__ for public API exposure. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are present. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and overall security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
