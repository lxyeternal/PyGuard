{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import and export module, organizing and exposing various components from local modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted data or external inputs observed",
  "flows": "Code imports specific classes and enums from local modules and then exposes them via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution; straightforward import/export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enums from internal modules (.ms, .enums, .utils) and then declares __all__ for export. No external data input, no dynamic execution, and no malicious patterns. The structure indicates typical module organization without malicious intent or obfuscation. All elements seem to be part of a modular design for a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module interface for internal components without any signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It functions as an organized export list for a Python package.",
