{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a larger package, exporting modules and classes related to computations, enums, utilities, and protections, likely for a security or data processing library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.ms, .enums, .utils) which presumably contain core functionality.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no code executes untrusted input, network calls, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible; the code only defines exports, with no runtime data processing or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard Python import/export syntax. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports specific classes and variables from local modules and declares them as part of the module's public API via __all__. It functions as a module initializer or interface definition. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or suspicious logic. The code structure is typical for a package's __init__.py file. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export file with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves to organize and expose components of a package, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
