  "flows": "Import of AbstractSender from sender module, then exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a class and exposes it, with no data flows, external interactions, or security-sensitive operations. All reviews agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for re-exporting a class, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
