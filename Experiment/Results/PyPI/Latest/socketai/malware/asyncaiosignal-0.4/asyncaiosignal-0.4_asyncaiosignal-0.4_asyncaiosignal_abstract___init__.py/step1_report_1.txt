  "purpose": "Define and export an abstract sender class for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statement from sender module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external interactions",
  "flows": "None, as the code only imports and exports a class reference",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named AbstractSender from a relative module sender and makes it available for external use via __all__. There is no data processing, no input handling, and no external communication. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python module defining an abstract class. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that exports an abstract class. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment.",
