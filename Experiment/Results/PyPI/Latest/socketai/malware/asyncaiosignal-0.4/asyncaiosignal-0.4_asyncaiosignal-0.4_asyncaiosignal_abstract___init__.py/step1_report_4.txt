  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, no unusual patterns, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class from a relative module and exposes it via __all__. There are no inputs, outputs, or executable code that could pose security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module that exports a class without any malicious intent or security risks.",
