{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package a Python project and includes a post-install process that downloads and executes an external executable file.",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from the URL 'https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty.exe' during the send() function call.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded executable 'ins42.exe' is executed via os.system('start ' + filename), which runs the file on the system.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves calling post_install(), which calls send(), downloading an external executable, saving it locally as 'ins42.exe', and then executing it.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads and executes an external binary during installation without any user prompt or validation. The executable is hosted on a third-party server, and the script automatically runs it, which is highly unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a send() function that fetches an executable from an external URL and executes it immediately after installation via os.system. The post_install() function triggers this behavior. The setup configuration registers this post_install as a console script, meaning that installing this package will automatically execute code that downloads and runs an external file. This pattern is highly indicative of malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, malware, or unwanted payloads. The code does not validate the downloaded content, making it susceptible to supply chain attacks. The use of os.system to run the file without safeguards further heightens the risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which can compromise system security. This is highly suspicious and likely malicious, constituting a supply chain security threat.",
