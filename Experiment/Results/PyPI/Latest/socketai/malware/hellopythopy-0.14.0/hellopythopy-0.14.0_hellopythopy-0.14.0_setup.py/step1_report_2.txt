{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package that, upon installation, downloads and executes an external executable file from a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The URL in the send() function used with requests.get, and the post_install() function that triggers send() after installation.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executing the downloaded executable ('ins42.exe') on the user's system.",
  "flows": "The code downloads data from an external URL in send(), writes it to a file, and then executes that file via os.system, triggered during post_install() after setup.",
  "anomalies": "The immediate download and execution of an external executable ('ins42.exe') during or after package installation is highly unusual and suspicious behavior. Usage of requests to fetch an executable and directly running it without validation indicates potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and requests, then defines a function send() that downloads an executable from a specified URL and runs it via os.system. The post_install() function calls send(), and this function is registered as a console script in setup(), which means it could be triggered during or after installation. This behavior resembles malicious activity—downloading and executing external code automatically—without user consent or validation. Such actions could be used to install malware or backdoors on the user's system. The code does not perform any checks on the downloaded file, nor does it verify its integrity, increasing the risk. Overall, the code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior, aiming to execute external code surreptitiously during setup.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains highly suspicious and potentially malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation. It appears designed to compromise user systems by running unauthorized code without consent.",
