  "purpose": "Starts a Flash policy server for web socket connections, likely to serve cross-domain policy files.",
  "sources": "import sys; web3socket.policyserver.FlashPolicyServer",
  "sinks": "server.start(); server.serve_forever()",
  "flows": "Initialization of server object from imported module, then starting the server to listen for connections",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The server is started with a 'noisy=True' parameter, which might produce verbose logs, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a module, initializes a server instance with a parameter that controls verbosity, and then starts it to listen indefinitely. It outputs server details to standard error. There are no indications of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious network activity within this code snippet. The server is used for serving cross-domain policies, which is a common requirement for WebSocket applications. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script simply initiates a Flash policy server, which is a standard component for WebSocket cross-domain communication. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this code snippet.",
