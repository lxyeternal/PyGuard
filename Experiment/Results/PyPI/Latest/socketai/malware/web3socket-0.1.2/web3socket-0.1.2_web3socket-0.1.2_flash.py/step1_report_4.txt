  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server for WebSocket connections to allow cross-domain access, primarily for development or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Importing web3socket.policyserver and initializing FlashPolicyServer object",
  "sinks": "Calling server.start() and server.serve_forever() to run the server; printing server information to standard error",
  "flows": "Initialization of server object -> starting the server -> server runs indefinitely; server details printed to stderr",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; standard server start-up process",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class from a potentially third-party library, starts a WebSocket flash policy server, and logs server info. No untrusted input handling, no data leaks, no network connections initiated outside the server itself, and no obfuscated or suspicious code segments. The server runs indefinitely, which is typical for server scripts. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward server startup script for a WebSocket flash policy server. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present in this code fragment.",
