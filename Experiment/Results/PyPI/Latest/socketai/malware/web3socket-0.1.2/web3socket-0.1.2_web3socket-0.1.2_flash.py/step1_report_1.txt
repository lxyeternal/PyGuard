  "purpose": "Starts a Flash policy server for WebSocket connections, likely to facilitate cross-domain socket communication.",
  "sources": "Importing sys and FlashPolicyServer; calling server.start() and server.serve_forever(); printing server details to stderr.",
  "sinks": "server.start() and server.serve_forever() initiate server processes; printing to stderr outputs server info.",
  "flows": "Import sys -> instantiate FlashPolicyServer -> start server -> output server info -> serve_forever loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The script's purpose appears to be serving a policy file for WebSocket clients.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the Web3socket package's policy server component, initializes a server with a noisy mode, starts the server, and then enters an infinite loop to serve requests. It outputs server details to stderr. There are no inputs, no untrusted data handling, and no external connections or data exfiltration activities evident. The code is straightforward and related to WebSocket policy serving, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a WebSocket Flash policy server with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply starts and runs a server to serve cross-domain socket policies. No malicious activity or security risks are identified based on this code snippet.",
