  "purpose": "Starts a WebSocket Flash policy server for cross-domain communication.",
  "sources": "Importing sys and web3socket.policyserver.FlashPolicyServer; server initialization with no parameters; server.start(); server.serve_forever()",
  "sinks": "Server listening on network ports; logs output to stderr",
  "flows": "Initialization of server -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns; straightforward server setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, direct implementation of a WebSocket Flash policy server. It imports necessary modules, initializes the server with verbose logging enabled, starts the server, logs server details, and enters an infinite loop to serve requests. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The server's purpose is legitimate, and the code is readable and standard for such use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a WebSocket cross-domain policy file without any malicious or suspicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1—are appropriate given the minimal exposure of a network service. No modifications are necessary.",
