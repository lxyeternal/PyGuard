  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server for WebSocket security.",
  "sources": "Importing web3socket.policyserver and server.start()",
  "sinks": "None apparent; server operations are internal and serve network policies",
  "flows": "No untrusted input flows are evident; server runs in a controlled manner",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior; no use of untrusted data sources",
  "analysis": "The script imports a policy server class and initiates it, which is typical for enabling cross-domain WebSocket connections in a controlled environment. The server runs on default settings, and the script only outputs its listening address to standard error. No data is transmitted or manipulated directly by the script, and there are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or network communication with suspicious domains. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of serving policy files for WebSocket security.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign server setup script for WebSocket security policy. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent within this code fragment.",
