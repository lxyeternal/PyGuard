  "purpose": "Serve a Cross-Domain Policy file for Flash clients over a network socket.",
  "sources": "Reads incoming socket connection requests when a client connects.",
  "sinks": "Sends the predefined XML policy string via socket.sendall().",
  "flows": "Connection request -> handle() -> socket.sendall(policy); if noisy, print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious hardcoded data beyond standard policy string; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server class that inherits from gevent.server.StreamServer, designed to serve a Cross-Domain Policy XML for Flash clients. It listens on port 843 by default, which is typical for such policies. The handle method simply sends a static XML string and optionally logs connections. No user input is processed or validated beyond connection acceptance. No external data, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code is straightforward and consistent with standard policy server implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply responds to client connections with a static policy XML. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
