  "purpose": "Serve a static cross-domain policy XML for Flash clients upon connection.",
  "sources": "Socket accept in handle method, reading connection data (implicitly via socket), no external input processing.",
  "sinks": "socket.sendall() sending static XML policy string.",
  "flows": "Connection accepted -> handle() called -> socket.sendall(policy) executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The policy allows all domains and ports, which is permissive but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Flash cross-domain policy server using gevent's StreamServer. It listens on port 843, accepts connections, optionally logs them, and responds with a static XML policy allowing all domains and ports. No input validation, credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is clear, correct, and aligns with typical implementations. The main security concern is the permissiveness of the policy, which could be exploited if misused, but this is inherent to such servers and not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score (~0.2-0.3) appropriately reflects the permissive policy. Confidence in this assessment is high (~0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a Flash cross-domain policy server. It contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The permissive policy is a security consideration but not malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
