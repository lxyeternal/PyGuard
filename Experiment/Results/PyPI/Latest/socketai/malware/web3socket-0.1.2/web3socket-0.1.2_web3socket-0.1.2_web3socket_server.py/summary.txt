  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server implementation for WebSocket and static content serving, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The overall security risk is low, primarily due to broad exception handling and static file serving, which are standard patterns but could be refined for robustness. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is 0.2, consistent with the analysis."
