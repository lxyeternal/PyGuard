  "purpose": "Implement a WebSocket server with support for Web3Socket connections and static file serving, including policy server management and logging.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, HTTP headers, socket connections, and file system reads.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, network socket connections, logging output, and HTTP response handling.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and HTTP headers flows into socket handling and static file serving; data is written to logs and network responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated exception syntax (`except IOError, ex`), broad exception handling (`except:`), and potential reliance on environment variables without validation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a server with handlers for WebSocket communication, static file serving, and policy management. It uses environment variables and HTTP headers to determine behavior, manages socket connections, and performs file I/O for serving static files. The exception handling is broad but typical for server code; no suspicious or malicious logic observed. The code does not perform any network calls to external or suspicious domains, nor does it contain code that would exfiltrate data or execute malicious actions. The use of standard libraries and patterns appears benign. Overall, the code appears to be a standard server implementation with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard server-side implementation for WebSocket handling and static file serving. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The code appears safe with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
