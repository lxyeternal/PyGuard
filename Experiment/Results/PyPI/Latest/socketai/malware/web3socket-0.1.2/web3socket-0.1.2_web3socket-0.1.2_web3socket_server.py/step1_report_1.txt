{
  "purpose": "Implements a WebSocket server with handling for socket connections, file serving, and policy server management.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables (self.environ), HTTP headers (HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH), and file system (open, sys.stderr).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include open() for reading files, sys.stderr for error output, and the write() method for HTTP responses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and HTTP headers into conditional logic, file reads, and response generation; also from open files into hashing for ETag.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception handling that broadly catches exceptions, including in critical areas like file access and logging, but no suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages socket connections, serves static files with ETag support, and manages a policy server. It reads environment variables, headers, and files. No suspicious or malicious logic is evident. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is present. The use of broad exception handling could mask errors but isn't inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate server implementation for WebSocket and static file serving, with management for a policy server component. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
