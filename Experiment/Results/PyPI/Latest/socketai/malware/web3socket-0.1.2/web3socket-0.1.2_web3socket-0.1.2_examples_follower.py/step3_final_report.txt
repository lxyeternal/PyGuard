{
  "purpose": "This code implements a WebSocket-like server managing client connections, serving static files, and broadcasting messages periodically. It is designed for a web3 application environment.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from socket.receive(), reads static files from disk (e.g., 'json.js', 'follower.html'), and environment variables like 'PATH_INFO'.",
  "sinks": "Socket.send() for outgoing messages, file reading operations, and printing logs. No untrusted data directly influences critical operations beyond socket communication.",
  "flows": "Input from socket.receive() flows to the receive() method; static file paths are read and served; broadcast messages are generated from the current time and socket count, then sent via socket.send().",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert message is None' in receive() could cause server crashes if a message is received, representing a stability concern but not malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code manages websocket connections and static file serving with standard libraries and patterns. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The assertion in receive() could be exploited for denial of service, but it does not involve malicious code or external network abuse. The overall structure and data flows are benign, with no obfuscation or suspicious behaviors. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects a minor stability concern rather than malicious intent. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign WebSocket server with static file serving and periodic broadcasting. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain threats are detected. The only minor concern is the assertion that could be exploited for denial of service, but it does not constitute malicious behavior.",
