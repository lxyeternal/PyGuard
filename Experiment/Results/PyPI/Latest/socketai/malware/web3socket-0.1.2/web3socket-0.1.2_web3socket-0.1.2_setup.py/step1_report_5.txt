  "purpose": "Setup script for the web3socket Python package, configuring its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data output or external calls present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from the package's __init__.py, then uses that in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, extracts version info via regex from the package's __init__.py, and calls setup() with package metadata. No user input, network calls, or code execution from untrusted sources. The version extraction method is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious activity.",
