{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for the 'web3socket' Python package, facilitating package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from 'web3socket/__init__.py' file using regex.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a manner that could cause harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The version string extracted from the file flows into the setup function as the package version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version info from a source file, which is common but can be manipulated if the source file is maliciously altered. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import setup from setuptools or distutils, then extracts the package version via regex from the '__init__.py' file. The version is asserted to be present, then used in the setup() call with package metadata and dependencies. No user input, network connections, or code execution based on untrusted data is evident. The code is standard for Python package setup, with no malicious or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is standard and appears safe. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its purpose is solely for packaging. The extraction of version info is typical, with no signs of malicious obfuscation or behavior.",
