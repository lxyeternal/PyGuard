{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'web3socket', used to configure package metadata and installation requirements.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using regex; imports setup functions from setuptools or distutils.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data output or external calls based on provided code.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file and passes it to setup(); no external data flows or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "The regex for version extraction relies on a specific format but appears straightforward; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading version info, and calling setup() with static metadata. It uses a regex to extract version info from a source file, which is common practice. No external network calls, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The code structure and logic are straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
