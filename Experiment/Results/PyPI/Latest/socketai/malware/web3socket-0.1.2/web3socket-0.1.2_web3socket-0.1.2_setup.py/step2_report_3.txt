  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n\n- The code is a typical Python package setup script.\n- It reads the version from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using regex, which is a common practice.\n- It imports 'setup' from setuptools or distutils.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The code appears straightforward and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes version extraction and setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; flows are local.\n- **Anomalies:** Uses regex, but standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.\n\n**Comment:** The securityRisk score of 0.1 seems slightly high given the absence of any vulnerabilities. Since the code is standard, I suggest lowering this to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- Similar to Report 1, with identical reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Comment:** Same as above; the minimal security risk is justified as zero.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Comment:** Perfectly aligned; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- Same reasoning; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Comment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Comment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher in some reports (0.1), but given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities, I recommend setting this to **0** across all reports for consistency.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The regex-based version extraction, while standard, could be a point of concern if the source file is maliciously altered. However, this is a common practice and not inherently risky.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate; my only recommendation is to lower the 'securityRisk' scores from 0.1 to 0, given the absence of any vulnerabilities or suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are mostly appropriate, with minor adjustments suggested for consistency.",
