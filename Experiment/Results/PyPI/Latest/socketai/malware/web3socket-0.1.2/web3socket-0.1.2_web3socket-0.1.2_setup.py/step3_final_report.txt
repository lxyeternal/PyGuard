  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads version info and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' via regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads version from file, then calls setup() with static data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex for version extraction, but this is common; no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns. It reads version info from a file using regex, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious dependencies are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk (~0.1). The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. The minor risk score reflects reliance on regex, but this is a common and acceptable pattern in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
