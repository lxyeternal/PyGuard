{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'web3socket', including retrieving its version and specifying package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' file using regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The version string is read from the file and used directly in the setup function; no other data flows or external inputs are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Use of regex for version extraction is standard, but relies on the file's format being correct.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup procedure. It reads the version info from the package's __init__.py file via regex, which is a common practice. The code includes a fallback import for 'setuptools'. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, code execution, or obfuscated logic. All dependencies are standard, and no untrusted input sources or sinks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
