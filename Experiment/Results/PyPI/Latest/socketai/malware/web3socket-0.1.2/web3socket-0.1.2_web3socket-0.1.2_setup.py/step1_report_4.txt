  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the web3socket Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'web3socket/__init__.py' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static or derived from local files.",
  "flows": "Reads the version string from a local file, then passes static data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a regex to extract version info from the file, which is standard. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No network activity or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup: importing modules, extracting version info via regex, asserting version presence, and calling setup() with static configuration parameters. No untrusted input handling beyond reading local files, no dynamic execution, no network or file system operations other than reading a local file, and no suspicious logic. All practices are typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It merely reads a version string from a local file and proceeds with package setup. No anomalies, malware, or security threats are evident.",
