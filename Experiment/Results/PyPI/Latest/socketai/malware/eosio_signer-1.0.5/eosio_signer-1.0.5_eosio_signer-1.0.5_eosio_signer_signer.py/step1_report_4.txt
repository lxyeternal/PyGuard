  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations with method placeholders for subclass implementation.",
  "sources": "Initialization method (__init__) with optional private_str parameter, class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward abstract class with no implementation; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an abstract base class 'Signer' with a constructor accepting an optional string, and four abstract methods related to cryptographic signing: 'to_public', 'to_wif', 'sign', and 'verify'. There are no side effects, external data handling, or embedded logic beyond interface definitions. The class appears to serve as an interface for cryptographic operations, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract class defining a cryptographic signing interface with no suspicious activity or malicious intent. It is unlikely to pose security risks.",
