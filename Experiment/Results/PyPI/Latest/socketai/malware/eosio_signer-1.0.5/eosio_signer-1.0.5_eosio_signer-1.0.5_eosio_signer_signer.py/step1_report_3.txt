{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Signer' for cryptographic signing operations, specifying method signatures for subclasses.",
  "sources": "Initialization method (__init__) with a default empty string parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; the class contains only abstract method definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; methods are placeholders to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of concrete implementation or suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets, no network operations, and no data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with method signatures for cryptographic signing and verification. There are no active data inputs, outputs, or side effects. The __init__ method accepts a parameter but does not process or store it. Since the class is purely abstract, it cannot execute any malicious actions or contain embedded malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward abstract base class with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a template for implementing signing functionality in subclasses. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
