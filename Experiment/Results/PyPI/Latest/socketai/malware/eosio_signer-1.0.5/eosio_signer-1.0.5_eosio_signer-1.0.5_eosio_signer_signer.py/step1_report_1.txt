{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading input or data; class constructor and abstract methods only define interface.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, external communication, or data processing occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; methods are abstract and no implementation is provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious patterns or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Signer' with methods for cryptographic operations. It contains a constructor initializing with an optional private string, but does not process or handle any data directly. All methods are abstract, implying that actual implementations will be provided elsewhere. No data leakage, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security flaws within this interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply establishes an interface for cryptographic signing, with no executable logic or external interactions. It appears benign, with no malicious intent or security risks evident.",
