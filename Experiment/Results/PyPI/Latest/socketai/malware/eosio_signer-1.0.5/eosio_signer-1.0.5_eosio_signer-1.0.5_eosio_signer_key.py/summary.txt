  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate cryptographic operations but contains a malicious side activity: covert collection and upload of system information to an external server during initialization. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and is highly malicious. The cryptography code is standard and not malicious, but the overall package exhibits malicious activity due to the exfiltration behavior."
