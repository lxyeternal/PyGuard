{
  "purpose": "Import the EOSIOKey class from a local key module, likely for cryptographic or blockchain key management.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the import is static and does not involve runtime data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement: 'from .key import EOSIOKey'. It is a standard Python import with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The context suggests it may relate to key management, but the snippet alone does not indicate any security concern. The confidence in benign assessment is high, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
