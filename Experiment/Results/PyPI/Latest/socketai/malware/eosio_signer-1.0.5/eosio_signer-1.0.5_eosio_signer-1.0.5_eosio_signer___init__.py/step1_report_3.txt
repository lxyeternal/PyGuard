  "purpose": "Importing the EOSIOKey class from a local module named 'key'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file 'key.py' within the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present in this snippet; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable within this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple import statement; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named EOSIOKey from a relative module 'key'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity in this snippet. Since it is a straightforward import statement, it doesn't exhibit any malicious or security risk indicators. Without additional context or code, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign part of a larger codebase, assuming the imported module and class are legitimate.",
