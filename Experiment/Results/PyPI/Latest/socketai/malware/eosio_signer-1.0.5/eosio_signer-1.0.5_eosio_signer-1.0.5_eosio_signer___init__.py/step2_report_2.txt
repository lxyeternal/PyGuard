  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .key import EOSIOKey`.\n- The reports consistently conclude that this is a benign, straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), and malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent detected.\n- The only minor variation is report 5, which assigns a small security risk (0.1) due to the context of key management, but still no evidence of actual malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code is a simple import statement.\n- **Errors or flaws in logic:** No, the reasoning is consistent; all reports correctly identify this as benign.\n- **Scores:** The scores seem reasonable given the evidence. The malware score remains at 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The import statement itself does not pose security risks.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The mention of key management is contextual but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The risk scores should remain very low or zero.\n- The malware score should stay at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The security risk score could be slightly elevated (e.g., 0.1) in the context of key management, but only if further code suggests insecure handling.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided snippet and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk evident)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code snippet is a benign import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nAny future concerns about security should consider the contents of the `key` module and how `EOSIOKey` is used elsewhere, but based solely on this import line, there is no issue.",
