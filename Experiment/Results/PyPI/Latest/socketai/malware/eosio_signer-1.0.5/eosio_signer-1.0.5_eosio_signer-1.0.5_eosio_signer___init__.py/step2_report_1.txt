  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom .key import EOSIOKey\n```\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward import statement.\n- It imports a class `EOSIOKey` from a local module `key`.\n- There are no apparent data flows, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The context suggests it might be part of a blockchain or cryptographic application, but the import alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no issues detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; standard import, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; minimal code, benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Analysis:** Correct; straightforward import, no issues.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Analysis:** Slightly higher security risk score due to potential key management context, but based solely on the import statement, this is an overestimate.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score should remain very low, as the code snippet alone does not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n- No report warrants a higher malware or obfuscated score.\n- The slight security risk in report 5 could be justified if additional context suggested key handling, but from this snippet alone, it remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to 0, reflecting no evident security issues.\n\n**Summary:** The import statement is standard, benign, and poses no security threat based on the provided information. The current scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context or code, this import statement alone does not indicate any security concern.",
