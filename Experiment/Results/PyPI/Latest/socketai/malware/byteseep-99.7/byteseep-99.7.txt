      "conclusion": "The code's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation without validation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main.py' contains malicious instructions. The behavior aligns with common supply chain attack techniques. The malware and security risk scores should be set high (around 0.6-0.7), and caution is advised when using or distributing such packages."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious or suspicious behavior primarily through unencrypted collection and transmission of system info to suspicious domains, indicating data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity. It should be flagged as highly malicious with high security risk. The scores are consistent with the behavior, with a slight recommendation to elevate malware score to 0.9 for maximum caution."
