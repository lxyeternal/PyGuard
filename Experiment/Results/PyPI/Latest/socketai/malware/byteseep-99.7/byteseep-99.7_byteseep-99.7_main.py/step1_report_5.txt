{
  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs, potentially for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, username, and current working directory.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs transmitting system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, user, path) flows from sources to URL parameters, then data is sent over network to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated domain names, sending system info to untrusted domains, dynamic URL generation with a random number, no explicit user consent or validation.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host-specific data and transmits it via HTTP GET requests to suspicious URLs. The URLs are on seemingly malicious or untrusted domains (oast-cn, oast.fun). It uses a random number in the URL, possibly for tracking or evading detection. The code does not appear to perform any legitimate function or user interaction, raising suspicion of tracking or data exfiltration activity. No obfuscation or encryption is used, and the code simply reads system info and sends it over network connections to unknown hosts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be designed for tracking or exfiltration of system information to malicious or untrusted domains. It does not include any benign functionality and operates surreptitiously, indicating malicious intent.",
