  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to external URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, username, current working directory, and generates a random number.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, path, random number) is encoded into URL parameters and sent via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious external domains with obfuscated subdomains, sends potentially identifiable system info to them, and does so unconditionally. No user consent or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, and current directory, then constructs URLs to send this data along with a random number to external servers. The URLs are suspicious and suggest tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The data transmission occurs unencrypted over HTTP, which increases risk. No input validation or user controls are present. The URLs appear to be malicious or at least suspicious, designed to collect system info stealthily.",
  "conclusion": "The script is highly suspicious, likely intended for tracking or malicious data collection. It contacts multiple suspicious domains and transmits system information without user consent. The code's purpose aligns with malicious behavior, given its pattern of contacting unknown external servers with system data.",
