  "conclusion": "The code's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation without validation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main.py' contains malicious instructions. The behavior aligns with common supply chain attack techniques. The malware and security risk scores should be set high (around 0.6-0.7), and caution is advised when using or distributing such packages."
