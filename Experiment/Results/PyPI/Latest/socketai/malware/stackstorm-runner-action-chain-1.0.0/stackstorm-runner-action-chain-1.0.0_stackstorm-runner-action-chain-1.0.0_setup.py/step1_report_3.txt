  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation step to send system information over the network.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() to a suspicious URL with system information as parameters",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are collected and then sent via HTTP GET request to an external server",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior in the setup script, which normally only configures package installation, by collecting system info and sending it to an external URL without any clear purpose or user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and additional libraries to gather system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. A custom install class overrides the run method to execute standard installation steps, then proceeds to collect system info and sends it to an external URL via a GET request. This behavior is unusual for a setup script, which should not perform network operations or collect user/system data without explicit purpose. The URL used appears suspicious, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious activity. The code does not sanitize or verify the destination, and the collected data could include sensitive information.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains malicious behavior by secretly collecting and transmitting system data during package installation. This indicates a supply chain attack vector aimed at data exfiltration or system fingerprinting. The code's purpose is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
