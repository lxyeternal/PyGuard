  "purpose": "Define a setup script for a Python package that customizes the installation process.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The code sends collected system data via a GET request to an external URL (http://aeknnnsitysuxpmwevwu8f0o55ek42w0f.oast.fun).",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, cwd, username) flow into the requests.get call as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an outbound network request during installation without any user consent, sending potentially sensitive system information to an external server. The URL is suspicious and obfuscated, and the request is embedded in the setup process, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries for setup and system information gathering. It defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method, which first calls the original run method. It then collects hostname, current working directory, and username, and sends these details via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior can be used for tracking, reconnaissance, or exfiltration without user awareness. The URL appears suspicious and is likely controlled by an attacker, indicating malicious intent. There are no other suspicious or obfuscated elements in the code; the main concern is the network transmission of system data during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unusual and potentially malicious action by exfiltrating system information during package installation. It appears to be designed for tracking or reconnaissance, which is suspicious behavior for a package setup script. This should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
