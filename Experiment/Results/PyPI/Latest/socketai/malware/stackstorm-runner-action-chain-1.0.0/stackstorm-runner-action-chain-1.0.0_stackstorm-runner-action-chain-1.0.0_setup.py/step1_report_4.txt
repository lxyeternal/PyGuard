{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration that includes a custom installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install process.",
  "sinks": "The code sends system information (hostname, cwd, username) via an HTTP GET request to an external domain.",
  "flows": "Data from socket, os, and getpass sources flows into the requests.get call, transmitting system info to an external server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unsolicited network request during package installation, transmitting potentially sensitive system information without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools, defines a custom install class overriding the run method. It collects hostname, current directory, and username, then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain, likely exfiltrating system details during installation. The setup configuration registers this custom install class, meaning this behavior executes when the package is installed. The network request and data collection occur transparently, indicating malicious intent or at least privacy violation. The external domain appears suspicious and likely controlled by the attacker.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior aimed at exfiltrating system information during package installation, representing a significant security risk. The external domain and data collection are malicious indicators. The package should be considered dangerous for use.",
