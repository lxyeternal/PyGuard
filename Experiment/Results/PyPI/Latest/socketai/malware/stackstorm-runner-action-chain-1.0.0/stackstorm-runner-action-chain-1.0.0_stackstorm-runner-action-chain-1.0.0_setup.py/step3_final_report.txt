{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during package installation and transmits it to a suspicious external URL, likely for malicious data exfiltration or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "The data is read from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser() during the run() method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends the collected data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL, acting as the sink for the source data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the source functions (hostname, cwd, username) to the requests.get() call, which transmits it over the network to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "The network request occurs during package installation without user consent, transmitting system info to a suspicious URL. The URL appears obfuscated and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a covert data exfiltration during setup by collecting system identifiers and sending them to an external server. The behavior is unusual for a standard setup script and indicates malicious intent. The URL used is suspicious, supporting the malicious hypothesis. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the network activity is the primary anomaly. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0, confidence 0.9) are consistent with the observed behavior. Given the clear exfiltration activity, a malware score of 0.85 and a security risk score of 0.9 are justified, reflecting high malicious potential and privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-probability malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during installation to a suspicious external URL. It should be flagged as malicious, and the package should be audited or rejected to prevent supply chain compromise.",
