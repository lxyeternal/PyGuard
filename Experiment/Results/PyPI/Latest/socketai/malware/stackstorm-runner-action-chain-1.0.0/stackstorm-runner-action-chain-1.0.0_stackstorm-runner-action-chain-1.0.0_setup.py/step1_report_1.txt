  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation process.",
  "sources": "Imports from requests, socket, getpass, os; socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() with untrusted data (HTTP request to an external URL with collected system info)",
  "flows": "During installation, hostname, current directory, and username are collected and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external domain",
  "anomalies": "Inclusion of network request during setup process that transmits system information to an external server without clear purpose or user consent",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup.py installation process with a custom class. When run, it collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to an external URL using an HTTP GET request. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without user awareness. The external URL appears suspicious and could be used for fingerprinting or data collection. No other malicious actions are present, but this network activity is unusual and potentially malicious in a supply chain context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data exfiltration during package installation, which is suspicious and likely malicious behavior. It could be used for tracking or targeted reconnaissance without user consent.",
