{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package, with a custom installation step that sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() (during installation), and the requests.get() call with parameters.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() that transmits system information to a remote domain.",
  "flows": "During the 'run' method of the CustomInstall class, system info collected from hostname, current working directory, and username is sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends sensitive environment information (hostname, cwd, username) to an external server during installation without user consent or transparency; this behavior is unusual for typical setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the standard setup.py installation process by including a custom class 'CustomInstall' that overrides the run method. In this method, it collects system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data to a specified external server using an HTTP GET request. This action occurs automatically during package installation, which is suspicious because it leaks potentially sensitive system details without explicit user approval. The target URL appears obfuscated or maliciously chosen, indicating possible malicious intent or privacy invasion. No other malicious activities like file manipulation, privilege escalation, or backdoors are observed. The primary concern is the covert data exfiltration embedded in a standard setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious component that exfiltrates system information during package installation without user knowledge. This behavior indicates a malicious or privacy-invasive intent embedded within a seemingly benign setup script. It should be flagged for security concerns and removed or audited further before use.",
