      "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of main() during installation is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no malicious code is visible in the snippet, the behavior itself is a security concern. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a higher malware risk (~0.6) and overall security risk (~0.7). The package should be treated with caution until the content of main() is verified."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily performing data exfiltration to suspicious external domains without malicious payloads or destructive actions. Its behavior is suspicious and poses security and privacy risks, but it does not contain active malware or payloads. The current scores overstate malicious intent; malware score should be lowered, but the security risk remains high due to covert data transfer. It should be flagged for further investigation, especially regarding the external domains involved."
