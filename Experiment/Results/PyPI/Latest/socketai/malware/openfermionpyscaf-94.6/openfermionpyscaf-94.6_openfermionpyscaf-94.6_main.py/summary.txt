  "conclusion": "The code is primarily performing data exfiltration to suspicious external domains without malicious payloads or destructive actions. Its behavior is suspicious and poses security and privacy risks, but it does not contain active malware or payloads. The current scores overstate malicious intent; malware score should be lowered, but the security risk remains high due to covert data transfer. It should be flagged for further investigation, especially regarding the external domains involved."
