  "purpose": "Collect system information (host name, user, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function that reads network interface info, random.randint() for number generation, base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send HTTP requests to external domains with collected data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info collected via platform, getpass, os, and get_mac_addresses() -> Data encoded in base64 and URL-encoded -> Sent via HTTP GET request to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded external domains, no validation or encryption of sensitive data, use of base64 encoding which is not secure; no explicit malicious code but suspicious data collection and exfiltration pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, username, MAC addresses, current working directory, and generates a random number. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64. Then, it constructs URLs pointing to external domains and sends collected data as URL parameters via HTTP GET requests. The domains do not appear benign and may be used for tracking or malicious exfiltration. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but facilitates data collection and transmission. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present, but the communication pattern is suspicious, especially considering the external domains involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily gathering system information and exfiltrating it to potentially malicious or at least suspicious external servers. It does not contain explicit malicious payloads but facilitates data leakage. The external domains are not standard or known reputable services, raising security concerns about potential malicious intent.",
