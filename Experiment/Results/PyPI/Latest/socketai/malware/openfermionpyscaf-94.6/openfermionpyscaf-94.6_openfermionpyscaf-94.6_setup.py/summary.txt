  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of main() during installation is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no malicious code is visible in the snippet, the behavior itself is a security concern. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a higher malware risk (~0.6) and overall security risk (~0.7). The package should be treated with caution until the content of main() is verified."
