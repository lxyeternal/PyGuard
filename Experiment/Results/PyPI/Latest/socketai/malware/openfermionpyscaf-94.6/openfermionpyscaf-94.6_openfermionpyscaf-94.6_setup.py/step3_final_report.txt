  "purpose": "The setup script executes main() from an external module during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The call to 'from main import main' and subsequent invocation of main() in the run() method of the CrazyInstallStrat class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() during setup, which could run arbitrary or malicious code.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method calls install.run(self), then imports main from main and executes main(), creating a source-to-sink flow of code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external code (main()) during package installation, which is unusual and risky; no obfuscation or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after standard installation, imports and runs main() from an external module. This pattern is suspicious because it can execute arbitrary code during setup, a common tactic for malicious backdoors. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The main concern is the potential for malicious payloads within main(). The scores assigned in reports (malware around 0.4-0.5, security risk 0.4-0.6) are appropriate given the behavior, but considering the high risk of executing external code, a higher malware score (around 0.6) is justified. The obfuscated score remains zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation. Overall, the pattern warrants caution, and further review of the main module is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of main() during installation is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes. While no malicious code is visible in the snippet, the behavior itself is a security concern. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a higher malware risk (~0.6) and overall security risk (~0.7). The package should be treated with caution until the content of main() is verified.",
