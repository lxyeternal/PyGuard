  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration with a custom install command that executes a function from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definition, run method, main import, setup() function",
  "sinks": "Executing 'main()' function from main.py after installation",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run method calls 'main()' from main.py, which is invoked automatically after setup",
  "anomalies": "Custom install class executes code from main.py without clear validation; 'main()' is called unconditionally during installation",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that runs the standard install process and then imports and executes 'main()' from main.py. This behavior occurs every time the package is installed, potentially executing arbitrary code embedded in main.py. No obvious malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors is visible in this script, but the unconditional execution of external code during install is unusual and could be misused if main.py contains malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident in this fragment, but the pattern itself is suspicious for supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code introduces a custom install step that executes 'main()' from main.py during installation, which could be exploited to run malicious code if main.py contains harmful logic. While the script itself does not show direct malicious activity, the unconditional execution at install time raises security concerns. It is advisable to review the contents of main.py for malicious behaviors.",
