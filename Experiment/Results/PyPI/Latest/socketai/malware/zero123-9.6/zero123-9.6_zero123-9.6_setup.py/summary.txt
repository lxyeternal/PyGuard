  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security concern, as it can be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main()' is harmful. While the code appears benign, this behavior warrants thorough review of 'main.py'. The malware risk score should be elevated to reflect the potential for malicious activity, and the overall security risk is high. Caution is advised before trusting or deploying this package."
