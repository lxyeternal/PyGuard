  "anomalies": [
    "Sending system identifiers and MAC addresses to multiple external URLs without user consent",

  ],
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data via GET requests to several external URLs. The domains appear suspicious and may be used for tracking or malicious purposes. The data collection is performed silently without user awareness or consent. The code does not include any obvious malicious payload such as reverse shells, data exfiltration beyond this, or system modifications. However, the behavior suggests potential privacy violations and covert data harvesting, which could be exploited maliciously. The use of subprocess calls to fetch MAC addresses varies based on OS, which is typical, but combined with the external data exfiltration raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to covertly collect system information and send it to external servers, which could be used for tracking or malicious monitoring. No direct malware behavior like system damage or remote control is evident, but privacy violations are present. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to data exfiltration without user consent.",
