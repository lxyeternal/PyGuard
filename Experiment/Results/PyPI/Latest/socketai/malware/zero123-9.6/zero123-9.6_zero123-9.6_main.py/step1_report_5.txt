  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data to external URLs for tracking or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), MAC addresses via subprocess calls, and generates a random number for request identification.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP GET requests to external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen with constructed query parameters containing collected information.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are gathered, encoded in base64, then included as URL parameters in HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated or suspicious-looking URLs associated with oast-cn and oast.fun domains, which are often used for testing or tracking purposes. Collects MAC addresses and encodes them, possibly for fingerprinting. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The code makes network requests with collected data, which could be used for tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encoding the MAC addresses in base64. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious or testing domains, appending the collected data as URL parameters and sending requests without validating responses. The use of multiple system commands for MAC address retrieval, encoding, and network communication indicates data collection behavior. There are no signs of malicious payloads like data exfiltration of sensitive info beyond system fingerprinting or executing malicious commands. The URLs used are suspicious, potentially indicating tracking or testing behavior. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no malware behaviors like network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious file modification are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily performs system fingerprinting and sends this information to external servers, possibly for tracking or monitoring purposes. There is no evidence of malware, malicious payloads, or supply chain sabotage. It uses suspicious URLs but lacks active malicious actions or payloads. The overall security risk is low, but the activity might be undesirable or invasive depending on context.",
