  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs as encoded parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system commands for MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with URL parameters containing system information.",
  "flows": "System info sources -> Base64 encoding of MAC addresses -> URL parameters -> HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses, multiple external request URLs, no validation or filtering of URLs, and sending potentially sensitive data without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers identifiable system data such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses via platform-specific commands. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs with these parameters, then makes HTTP GET requests to three external domains. The external domains appear suspicious and are hosted on non-standard domains with no clear legitimate purpose. The code does not process responses meaningfully, but it actively transmits system identifiers to potentially malicious endpoints. The use of random numbers in URL parameters could be to evade detection or track requests, and there is no user prompt or confirmation. Overall, the script is collecting and exfiltrating system information without explicit user consent, indicative of data collection for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system identifiers and exfiltrating them to external, suspicious domains without user consent. It uses encoding and multiple external URLs to obscure or spread the data collection, which raises security concerns.",
