{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs for tracking or other purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces, and base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send data to external URLs with encoded parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is gathered, base64-encoded, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The code contacts suspicious external domains that appear to be malicious or for tracking. The URLs are obscure, and data is encoded before transmission. No explicit authentication or encryption is used, and the purpose appears to be data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script collects identifiable system information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) and encodes MAC addresses in base64. It then constructs URLs with this data as query parameters and sends requests to three suspicious external domains. The URLs do not appear legitimate and are likely used for tracking or malicious data collection. The code does not perform any malicious actions like file modification or execution of malicious payloads but acts as a tracking or exfiltration mechanism. It uses standard libraries, so no obfuscation or malicious code execution is detected beyond data collection and transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to secretly gather system information and transmit it to suspicious external servers, indicating malicious intent related to tracking or exfiltration. It does not perform destructive actions but demonstrates privacy-invasive behavior and potential for abuse in a malicious supply chain context.",
