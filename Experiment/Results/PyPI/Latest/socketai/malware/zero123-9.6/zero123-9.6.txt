      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security concern, as it can be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main()' is harmful. While the code appears benign, this behavior warrants thorough review of 'main.py'. The malware risk score should be elevated to reflect the potential for malicious activity, and the overall security risk is high. Caution is advised before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits privacy-invasive data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, which could be malicious in intent, especially if done without user consent. While it does not contain active malware like code execution or destructive payloads, its behavior warrants high security concern due to covert data transmission. The high malware and risk scores in some reports are justified by the exfiltration activity. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, it should be flagged for potential privacy violations and considered high risk in supply chain security assessments."
