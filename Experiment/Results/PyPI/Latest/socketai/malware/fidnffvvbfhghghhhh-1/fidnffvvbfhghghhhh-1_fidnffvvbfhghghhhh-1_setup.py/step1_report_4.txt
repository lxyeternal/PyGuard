{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package, including custom commands executed during installation, development, and egg info phases.",
  "sources": "The custom_command() function that retrieves an access token via a curl command and posts it to an external URL.",
  "sinks": "The curl command that transmits sensitive data (access token) to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "On installation, development, or egg info commands, custom_command() is executed, which fetches an access token from Google metadata and sends it to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a command that retrieves a Google Cloud instance's access token and immediately posts it externally, which is suspicious. The setup code is otherwise standard but includes potentially malicious behavior embedded in custom commands.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a typical Python package using setuptools. It defines custom command classes for install, develop, and egg_info, each of which executes the custom_command() function. The custom_command() performs a system call to fetch an access token from Google Cloud metadata server and then sends this token via POST request to a third-party URL. This behavior can be malicious as it leaks sensitive credentials without user consent, indicating a potential credential theft or backdoor. The code appears obfuscated or malicious due to the secret token retrieval and external data transmission embedded in the setup process, which is unusual and suspicious for a normal package.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior by automatically exfiltrating Google Cloud instance credentials during installation and setup phases, indicating a high security risk. The behavior suggests credential theft or backdoor activity embedded within a seemingly benign setup script.",
