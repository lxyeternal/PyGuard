      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup is a significant supply chain security concern. While the actual maliciousness depends on main.py's content, the pattern itself warrants elevated risk and malware scores. The current scores are conservative; increasing malware to 0.5 and risk to 0.7 provides a more accurate assessment of the potential danger."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behavior characteristic of covert data collection and exfiltration to suspicious domains, raising privacy and security concerns. While it does not contain active malware like destructive payloads or backdoors, its covert nature and data exfiltration pattern justify a moderate to high security risk. The malware likelihood is low to moderate, given the absence of malicious payloads but recognition of potentially malicious intent. The overall risk score is around 0.65, and malware score approximately 0.3 to 0.4, reflecting suspicion but not definitive malicious payloads."
