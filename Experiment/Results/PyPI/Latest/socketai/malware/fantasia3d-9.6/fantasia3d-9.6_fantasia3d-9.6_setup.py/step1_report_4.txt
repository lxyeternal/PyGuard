  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'fantasia3d' package with a custom installation step that executes 'main.main()' post-install.",
  "sources": "The 'main' module imported and executed in the 'run' method of the CrazyInstallStrat class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function during installation, which could potentially perform malicious actions if 'main' is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main' module after completing standard installation procedures.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code ('main()') post-installation without any validation or condition, which is unusual and potentially suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script overrides the default installation process to include a call to 'main()' from the 'main' module immediately after installation. This behavior is not typical for package setup scripts and could be exploited to execute malicious code upon package installation. The import of 'main' and invocation of 'main()' are direct and unconditional, raising concerns about hidden or malicious post-install behavior. The rest of the setup uses standard practices, but the custom 'run' method's behavior is potentially malicious if 'main()' performs harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard package setup but includes a suspicious post-install execution of 'main()', which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. This pattern is unusual and warrants caution, especially since it executes code during installation without validation.",
