  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup is a significant supply chain security concern. While the actual maliciousness depends on main.py's content, the pattern itself warrants elevated risk and malware scores. The current scores are conservative; increasing malware to 0.5 and risk to 0.7 provides a more accurate assessment of the potential danger."
