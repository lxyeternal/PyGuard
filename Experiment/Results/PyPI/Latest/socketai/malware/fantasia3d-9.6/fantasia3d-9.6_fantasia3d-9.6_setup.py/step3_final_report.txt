  "purpose": "The setup script executes main() from main.py during installation via a custom install class, which is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "sources": "Importing main from main.py and executing main() in the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() during setup, which could run arbitrary code or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method calls install.run(self), then imports main and executes main(), creating a source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code during package installation without validation or sandboxing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, after completing standard installation, imports and runs main() from main.py. This pattern is suspicious because executing arbitrary code during setup can be exploited for supply chain attacks. The pattern is consistent across reports, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The risk depends on the content of main.py, which is unknown, but the pattern itself is a red flag. Scores assigned in reports range from 0.25 to 0.4 for malware and 0.4 to 0.7 for security risk, which are conservative but reasonable. Given the potential for malicious payloads, the malware score should be increased to 0.5, and the security risk to around 0.7, to better reflect the high-risk pattern of executing external code during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup is a significant supply chain security concern. While the actual maliciousness depends on main.py's content, the pattern itself warrants elevated risk and malware scores. The current scores are conservative; increasing malware to 0.5 and risk to 0.7 provides a more accurate assessment of the potential danger.",
