  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'fantasia3d' package with a custom installation step that executes the 'main' function from 'main.py'.",
  "sources": "Import statements and the 'main' function call within the custom 'run' method of 'CrazyInstallStrat'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, 'install.run(self)' executes, then 'main()' from 'main.py' is called, potentially executing arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom 'run' method executes code from 'main.py' after installation, which could be malicious or maliciously injected. No validation or restrictions are placed on 'main'.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class that, after performing the standard install process, imports and executes 'main()' from 'main.py'. This behavior is unusual as it runs code during installation, which can be exploited to run malicious code or unwanted operations. The rest of the setup appears standard, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious dependencies. The malicious potential hinges on 'main.py' content, which is external and unknown. This pattern resembles a supply chain attack vector, as arbitrary code runs post-install.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes external code ('main()') during package installation, which can be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The overall risk is elevated due to code execution during setup, representing a supply chain security concern.",
