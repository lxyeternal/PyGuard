  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'fantasia3d' Python package, with custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "import statements, class definition, setup() function parameters",
  "sinks": "Calling main() function from main module during installation",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method executes, which then imports and executes main() from main module",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code (`main()`) after installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious if 'main' performs unwanted actions",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines a custom install class that executes code post-installation by calling 'main()' from a 'main' module. The setup() function specifies package details and dependencies. The key anomaly is the automatic execution of 'main()' during install, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main()' performs harmful actions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls are evident, but executing code during install is a suspicious pattern that could be used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the execution of an external 'main()' function during installation, which is an unusual behavior that could be exploited maliciously. While no direct malicious actions are visible, the pattern warrants caution as it can be used to execute arbitrary code.",
