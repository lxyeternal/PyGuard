  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses()) and network URL construction with parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP requests with encoded system data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is collected, encoded, and then transmitted via constructed URLs to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses, which may be an attempt to obfuscate data. The URLs are suspicious, pointing to potentially malicious domains. The code silently catches exceptions during network requests, preventing detection of network failures or anomalies. The collection of MAC addresses and system info combined and sent externally could facilitate user fingerprinting or tracking.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers various system details, including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses from different operating systems. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, likely to obscure their nature. The script constructs URLs with these parameters, sending requests to suspicious external domains, which could be malicious command-and-control servers or tracking endpoints. The silent exception handling prevents detection of failed transmissions. No direct malicious payload or backdoor is present, but the data collection and transmission pattern resemble behavior typical of tracking or data exfiltration malware. The domains used are suspicious and may be malicious. The overall behavior suggests a privacy-invasive activity, possibly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs system information collection and transmits data to suspicious external servers, which could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or malicious command-and-control communication. There is no evidence of active malicious payloads like malware or system sabotage, but the data exfiltration behavior is suspicious and could be malicious depending on user intent.",
