  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to specific external URLs for tracking or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "Platform module (platform.node()), getpass module (getpass.getuser()), os module (os.getcwd()), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces, and random module (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls sending data to external URLs with encoded system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses) are collected, encoded (MAC addresses), and appended as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names; encoding MAC addresses and other system info without encryption; multiple URLs possibly for data exfiltration; lack of validation or response handling; use of shell=True with subprocess calls which can be risky, though not exploited here. The code does not perform any obvious malicious actions but is consistent with data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across different OSes. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64. The code then constructs URLs with these details as query parameters and sends GET requests to external servers, possibly for tracking or data collection. The URLs are suspicious and appear to be used for monitoring or malicious data harvesting. No malicious payload or destructive actions are present, but the behavior aligns with covert data exfiltration. The use of subprocess with shell=True could be risky if untrusted inputs were involved, but here it is used with static commands. Overall, the script looks like it could be part of a malicious or at least privacy-invasive campaign, depending on the context of usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to silently collect system data and transmit it to external servers without user consent. While it does not execute malicious payloads or destructive actions, its data exfiltration behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious in a threat context.",
