  "purpose": "Collect system information (host name, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs encoded in base64, with a random number parameter.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), MAC addresses via subprocess, random number generation.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC address (base64-encoded) flow from sources to URL parameters, transmitted over network to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain patterns, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, inclusion of system info in GET request parameters without validation, and the use of random numbers for URL parameter uniqueness. The URLs appear to be non-legitimate and possibly malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects host system info including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It constructs three URLs with these parameters, appending a random number for each request, and sends GET requests to these URLs. The URLs are suspicious, pointing to domains that appear potentially malicious or used for tracking. No data received from responses is processed. The code does not contain any obvious obfuscation or malicious payload execution but demonstrates data exfiltration behavior to untrusted domains. There are no clear malicious payloads like system damage, code execution, or backdoors, but the behavior resembles reconnaissance or tracking activity, which is suspicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and exfiltration to external URLs under suspicious domain names without clear user consent. While it does not contain direct malicious payloads, its behavior indicates potential privacy invasion or reconnaissance activity, warranting caution. The overall security risk is moderate to high given the suspicious domains and data exfiltration pattern.",
