{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen calls to external URLs with encoded parameters, potentially exfiltrating collected data.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and MAC addresses) are collected, encoded, and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domain URLs (including 'oast.cn', 'oast.fun') that could be used for malicious command and control or data exfiltration. The code encodes MAC addresses and other system info and sends to these URLs without user consent or indication of benign purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system data such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are obtained via system commands, which is standard but combined with encoding and transmission. The URLs are suspicious and possibly used for data exfiltration or malicious command-and-control communication. The code encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, indicating an attempt to obfuscate data. The data is sent via simple HTTP GET requests without any validation or encryption, which is risky. The code appears to be designed to silently collect and transmit data to external servers, typical of potentially malicious or tracking behavior. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident beyond data collection and transmission. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads are present beyond this data exfiltration pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system data and transmits it to suspicious external domains, which indicates potential malicious intent for data exfiltration or tracking. There are no obvious backdoors or destructive actions, but the data collection and transmission behavior is concerning and warrants security review.",
