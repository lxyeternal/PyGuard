  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'mumupatcher' Python package, specifying metadata and package inclusion.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling are present; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted inputs or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "The description field is set to 'None', which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata. It does not perform any runtime data processing, external communication, or code execution. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code are present. The package metadata appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup script is a typical package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It only defines package metadata for distribution.",
