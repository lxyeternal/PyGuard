  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, author, description, packages.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data used directly in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "Description set to 'None' as a string, which is unusual but benign; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with hardcoded parameters. No dynamic inputs, external data, code execution, or obfuscation are present. The description field being 'None' is benign. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1. The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions, nor does it contain vulnerabilities or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
