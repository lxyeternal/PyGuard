  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mumupatcher' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata (name, version, author, description, packages) for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; standard setup configuration only.",
  "flows": "Data from hardcoded strings flows into setup parameters; no dynamic or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behaviors or backdoors; description field is 'None', which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, defines metadata with hardcoded values, and calls setup() with these parameters. No code injection, data leakage, environment variable misuse, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is a straightforward setup script without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply specifies package metadata for distribution.",
