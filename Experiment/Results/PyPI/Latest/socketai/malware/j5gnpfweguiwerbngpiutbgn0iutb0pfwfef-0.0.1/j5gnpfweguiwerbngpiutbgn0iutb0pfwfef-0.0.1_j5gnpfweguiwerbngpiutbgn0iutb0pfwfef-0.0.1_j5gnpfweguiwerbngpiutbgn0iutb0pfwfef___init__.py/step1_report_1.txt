{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (package name, hostname, current directory) and send it to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading hostname via socket.gethostname(), reading current working directory via os.getcwd(), using hardcoded package name, and forming data payload.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via requests.post to an external URL, which could potentially leak information.",
  "flows": "Gather data from system functions, package name, hostname, current path → send via HTTP POST request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded package name that appears random and nonsensical, use of a suspicious external URL, no validation or obfuscation of data, and direct data exfiltration without user consent or clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system information including hostname and current working directory, then sends this data to a suspicious external URL. The package name appears arbitrary, possibly designed to mask malicious activity or avoid detection. The code does not perform any harmful actions directly but facilitates covert data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious behavior. There are no obfuscation techniques or complex logic, but the intent to send system info to an external server without user consent is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be used for covertly collecting and exfiltrating system information to an external server, which could be malicious. The use of a suspicious URL and arbitrary package name raises concerns about malicious intent. Overall, this code exhibits potentially malicious behavior intended for data exfiltration.",
