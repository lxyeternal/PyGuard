  "flows": "Gather system data from os and socket modules -> send via requests.post() to remote URL",
  "anomalies": "Use of a seemingly random package name, URL pointing to a suspicious domain, data collection of hostname and current working directory without user consent",
  "analysis": "The code collects system information including package name, hostname, and current directory, then transmits this data to an external URL. The package name appears to be random, suggesting obfuscation or an attempt to disguise malicious activity. The URL used is a suspicious domain (oastify.com), which is often used for security testing or malicious C2 (command and control) activities. There are no apparent safeguards or user consent prompts, and data is sent unencrypted over HTTP. While the code does not directly execute malicious commands, it gathers and exfiltrates system information, which is a common step in reconnaissance or data theft activities. The purpose of the code suggests potentially malicious intent due to data exfiltration to an untrusted domain.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to silently collect system details and send them to a suspicious external server, indicating potentially malicious or reconnaissance behavior. The code does not contain overt malicious commands like file damage or network exploitation, but the data exfiltration to a suspicious URL and the obfuscated package name raise security concerns.",
