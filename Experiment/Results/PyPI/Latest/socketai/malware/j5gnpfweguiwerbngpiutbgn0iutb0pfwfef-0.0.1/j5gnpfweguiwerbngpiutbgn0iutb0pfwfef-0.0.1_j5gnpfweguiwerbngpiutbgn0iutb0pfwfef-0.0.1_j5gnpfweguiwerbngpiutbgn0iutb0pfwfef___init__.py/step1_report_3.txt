  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to an external server via HTTP POST request.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and uses hardcoded package name.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over network using requests.post to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Gathers system info -> constructs data dictionary -> posts data to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a seemingly random package name; sends system info to a suspicious URL; no validation or user interaction; no response handling or error checking.",
  "analysis": "The code collects basic system information—package name, hostname, and current directory—and transmits it to an external URL controlled by an unknown entity. The URL appears suspicious (possibly malicious domain or relay). There are no input validations, and the code does not verify the server response. The purpose seems to be exfiltration of system data without user consent. The code does not perform any malicious actions directly on the system but facilitates data exfiltration, which could be part of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script exfiltrates system info to an external server without any user interaction or validation. The use of an obscure URL and data collection suggests malicious intent related to data harvesting or C2 communications. While it does not contain malware payloads per se, its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
