  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating private keys to an external server, with high suspicion supported by the suspicious domain and lack of security measures. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, security risk ~0.8) are justified and consistent with this analysis."
