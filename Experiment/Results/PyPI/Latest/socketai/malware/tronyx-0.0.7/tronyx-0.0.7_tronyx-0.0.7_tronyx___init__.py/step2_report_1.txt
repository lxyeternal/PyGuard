  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a single, minimal import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n- No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is detected in any report.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is reasonable for benign import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's actual content:\n- The code is just an import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code's purpose is clearly to import a symbol `perm` from a local module `main`.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code snippet is benign and typical for modular Python codebases.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The minimal import poses no security risk. The slight securityRisk score is acceptable as a conservative measure, but it could be 0 since no risk is evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Potential adjustments:\n- Since **all reports** agree that this is a benign import statement with no malicious activity, **malware scores should remain at 0**.\n- The **securityRisk scores** could be uniformly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no actual risk.\n- The **confidence** levels are already high and appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports (confirmed as straightforward code).\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0 for all reports, reflecting no actual security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a simple, standard import statement with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable, but securityRisk could be uniformly lowered to 0.\n- The malware scores are correct at 0.\n- Confidence levels are appropriate.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the code snippet provided.",
