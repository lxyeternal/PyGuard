  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n- No signs of data flow, external communication, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is minimal and standard Python syntax, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or embedded threats.\n- All reports assign high confidence (mostly 1, some 0.9), and all indicate zero malware risk and zero security risk, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippet itself is benign and typical for modular Python projects.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is only an import statement with no active behavior.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as expected.\n- Security risk: very low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree on benignity, there is no evidence to adjust scores.\n- The only point to consider is whether importing `perm` could be malicious if `main.py` is malicious, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The import statement itself is harmless.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- Given the limited context, the overall risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (or 0, considering the code's benign nature)\n\n**Note:** If further context shows that `main.py` or `perm` are malicious, the scores might need reevaluation, but based solely on this snippet, they are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary.",
