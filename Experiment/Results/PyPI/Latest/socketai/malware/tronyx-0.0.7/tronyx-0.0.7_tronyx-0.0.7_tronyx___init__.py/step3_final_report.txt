  "purpose": "Import the symbol 'perm' from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'main' to import 'perm'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "The import statement pulls 'perm' from 'main', with no further data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement: 'from .main import perm'. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The minimal nature of the code indicates benign intent. Scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0. Security risk is minimal; a score of 0 is appropriate. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The import statement is standard for modular Python projects. Scores are consistent with the analysis; security risk should be uniformly set to 0 for clarity.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
