{
  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local 'main' module, likely for further use in the script.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .main import perm' reads the 'perm' attribute from the 'main' module in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink flow occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement. No suspicious or unusual activity is detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'perm' from a relative module named 'main'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code execution based solely on this line. As a single import statement, it is standard Python syntax with no embedded threats. Without additional context or code, no malicious intent or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and typical of modular Python programs.",
