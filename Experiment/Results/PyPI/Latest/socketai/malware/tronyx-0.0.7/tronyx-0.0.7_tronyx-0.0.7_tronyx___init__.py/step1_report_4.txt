{
  "purpose": "Importing 'perm' from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module 'main' from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, only an import statement. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which is a standard practice for modular code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as hidden backdoors, code injection, or obfuscated logic. The import of 'perm' from a local module is typical for code organization. Given the limited context, no malicious or suspicious activity can be inferred from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger codebase, assuming 'main' and 'perm' are legitimate modules and functions.",
