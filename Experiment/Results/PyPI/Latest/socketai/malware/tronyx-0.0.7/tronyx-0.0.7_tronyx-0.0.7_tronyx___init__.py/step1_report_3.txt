  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a relative module within the package. It does not execute any untrusted input, nor does it contain any control flow or data processing logic. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs. Since the code is limited to an import, it cannot directly cause malicious activity or data leaks. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import and shows no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It is a normal package import statement with no anomalies.",
