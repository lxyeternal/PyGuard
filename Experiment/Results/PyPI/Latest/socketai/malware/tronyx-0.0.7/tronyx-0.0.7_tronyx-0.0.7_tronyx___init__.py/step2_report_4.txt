  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Activity:**\n   - All reports identify the code as a simple import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n   - There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code.\n   - The `malware` scores are consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are highly consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a straightforward import statement.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments appropriately note the lack of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - `malware` scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign code.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Risk Scores Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious activity, a `risk` score of 0.1 (or similar very low value) seems acceptable.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the minimal nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that no malicious activity is evident based solely on this snippet.\n   - Without additional context, there’s no basis to suspect malicious intent.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency:**\n   - The scores and conclusions are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis provided.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, likely just a default low risk for import statements)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard Python import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If additional context or code is provided later, reassessment may be necessary. But based solely on this snippet, the current scores and conclusions are justified.",
