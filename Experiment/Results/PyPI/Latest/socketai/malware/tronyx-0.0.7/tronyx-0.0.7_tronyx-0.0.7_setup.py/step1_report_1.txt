{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'tronyx' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description; static strings for package metadata and URL.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks or external communications from this script.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description and specifies package metadata and dependencies. No external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data sources are processed. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations beyond reading a local file, or execute dynamic code. All strings are static, and the structure follows typical Python packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears normal and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves its intended purpose of package configuration without introducing vulnerabilities.",
