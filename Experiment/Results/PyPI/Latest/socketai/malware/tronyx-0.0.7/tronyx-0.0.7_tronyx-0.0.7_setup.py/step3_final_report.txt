{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) used for packaging a library named 'tronyx'. It reads a local README.md file for the long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, author info, and project URL, with no dynamic or untrusted input processing.",
  "sources": "Reading the local 'README.md' file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies; URL string for repository",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> passing static data to setup() -> package metadata and dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and follows standard packaging practices",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script that reads a local file for documentation and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign intent. The dependencies and URLs appear legitimate. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is benign, standard, and poses no security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The high confidence scores (0.0 malware, 0.0 obfuscated, 0.0 security risk) are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
