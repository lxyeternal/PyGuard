  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'tronyx' Python package including metadata, dependencies, and repository info.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, and static strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static values used for configuration and package metadata.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources; flow is static configuration setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code reads a file for description, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading a README file, and calling setup() with package info. No input validation, no dynamic execution, no network or system commands. All data appears to be static or read from trusted sources. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly handles package configuration and metadata.",
