{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (user name, directory structure, system ID) during installation, encodes it in base64, and raises it as an exception, indicating potential covert data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "os.getlogin(), os.environ.get('USER'), subprocess.check_output(['id']), build_directory_tree() reading filesystem",
  "sinks": "send_put_request() which raises the encoded data as an exception",
  "flows": "Sources (system info collection) → encoding in base64 → passing to send_put_request() → raising as exception",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of raise to handle data exfiltration, presence of unused get_random_str() function, data collection during installation, no network transmission observed",
  "analysis": "The code gathers sensitive system info and encodes it. During installation, it calls exec_command(), which collects data, encodes it, and raises it as an exception via send_put_request(). This pattern is suspicious and resembles covert data exfiltration. The use of raise instead of network transmission suggests an attempt to hide or test data leaks. The code is straightforward, with no heavy obfuscation, but the behavior is abnormal for benign code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75, security risk ~0.8) are justified given the potential for privacy invasion and covert exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of covert data exfiltration during package installation. The pattern of collecting, encoding, and raising system info as an exception strongly suggests malicious intent. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate. No evidence of destructive actions or remote code execution is present, but the covert exfiltration pattern warrants high concern.",
