  "purpose": "Simple logging message indicating service module initialization.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; static print statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted outputs.",
  "flows": "None; the code executes a single static print statement without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single, static print statement with no inputs, external data, or complex logic. It performs a benign logging function. All reports confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a simple initialization log message. There are no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are justified and should remain unchanged.",
