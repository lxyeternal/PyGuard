  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code presence and behavior**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a single `print` statement outputting a static message. There are no inputs, no external data, no environment variables, and no dynamic code execution. The code's purpose is solely to log or indicate service initialization.\n\n2. **Potential issues and anomalies**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that there are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks complexity.\n\n3. **Scores assessment**:  \n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious intent or behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Logical consistency and reasoning**:  \n   The reports are consistent and reasonable. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n5. **Potential errors or overestimations**:  \n   Since the code is trivial, no report overestimates the risk. The conclusions are justified.\n\n6. **Additional considerations**:  \n   - No external dependencies or inputs mean no attack surface here.  \n   - The code does not perform any network communication, file I/O, or environment variable access that could be exploited.\n\n**Summary and my assessment**:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (correct, no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (correct, code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk score**: 0 (appropriate, no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note**:  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I agree with the reports' assessments. No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Overall estimate**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis code is purely informational and poses no security threat.",
