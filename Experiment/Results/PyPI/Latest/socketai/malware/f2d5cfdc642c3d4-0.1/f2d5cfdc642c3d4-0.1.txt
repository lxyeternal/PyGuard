      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior indicative of covert data exfiltration during package installation. The pattern of collecting, encoding, and raising system info as an exception strongly suggests malicious intent. The high malware and security risk scores are appropriate. No evidence of destructive actions or remote code execution is present, but the covert exfiltration pattern warrants high concern."
