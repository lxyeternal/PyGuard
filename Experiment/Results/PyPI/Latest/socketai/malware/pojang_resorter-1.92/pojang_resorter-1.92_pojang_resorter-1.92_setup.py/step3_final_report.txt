  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, constructs a path to 'your_executable.exe' within the package directory and executes it if present.",
  "sources": "The path to 'your_executable.exe' constructed from self.install_lib and the package subdirectory; the existence check os.path.exists(exe_path).",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True) which executes the executable without validation or user consent.",
  "flows": "Code constructs executable path -> checks existence -> executes executable via subprocess.run.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of an external executable during setup without validation, hardcoded executable name, no integrity checks, no user confirmation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to 'your_executable.exe' within the package directory and runs it if found, during installation. This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code without validation or user consent. The executable's purpose is unknown, and no security measures are in place. Multiple reports recognize this pattern as malicious or highly suspicious, assigning high malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. The behavior aligns with tactics used in malware distribution, such as executing malicious payloads during setup. Given the potential for harm, this pattern indicates a high security threat, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified. The executable could be malicious, and executing it unconditionally during install is a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an external executable during installation without validation, representing a high security risk. This pattern is commonly associated with malware or backdoors. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and such behavior should be flagged as unsafe. Users should avoid installing packages with this pattern unless the executable's purpose and source are verified.",
