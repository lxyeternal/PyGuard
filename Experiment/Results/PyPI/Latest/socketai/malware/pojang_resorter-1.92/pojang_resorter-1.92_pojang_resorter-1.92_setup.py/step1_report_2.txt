  "purpose": "Customize the post-installation process to run an executable after package installation.",
  "sources": "The code constructs the path to 'your_executable.exe' within the installed package directory and checks for its existence.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run([exe_path]) executes the specified executable, which could be malicious if the executable is malicious or altered.",
  "flows": "Path: Path is constructed during install -> Existence check -> Execution of the executable via subprocess.run.",
  "anomalies": "The script automatically runs an executable located within the package directory post-installation without validation or user confirmation. The executable path is hardcoded and not verified, which could be exploited if the package is compromised. The code prints status messages but does not verify the integrity or source of the executable.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, after completing standard installation, attempts to locate and run an executable ('your_executable.exe') inside the installed package directory. The process involves constructing the path, verifying its existence, and executing it via subprocess. This behavior is potentially malicious, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, which could be exploited to run malicious code or establish backdoors. There are no checks for the executable's integrity, origin, or purpose. While the code itself is straightforward, running an arbitrary executable from a package poses a significant security risk. The executable path is hardcoded, and the script does not sanitize or verify the executable before running.",
  "conclusion": "This code executes an executable located within the package immediately after installation, which could be malicious if the executable is compromised or maliciously inserted. The approach is suspicious because it runs code automatically during install without user approval or validation, representing a high security concern.",
