{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package named 'pojang_resorter' and execute an external executable post-installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package installation directory to construct a path to an executable ('your_executable.exe') within the package directory.",
  "sinks": "The code runs the external executable located within the package directory using subprocess.run.",
  "flows": "The installation process computes the path to the executable during setup, then potentially executes it if present.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of an external executable during package installation, with no validation or verification. The executable path is constructed based on installation directory; the executable is executed immediately if it exists, which could be malicious if the executable is tampered with or malicious by design.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after completing standard installation, constructs a path to an executable within the installed package directory. It then checks for the existence of this executable and runs it if found. This behavior could be malicious if the executable is malicious or maliciously injected, as it runs arbitrary code post-installation without user consent or verification. The code does not verify the integrity or origin of the executable, and executing external binaries during setup is a common tactic for malicious package behavior. However, the code itself appears straightforward and does not include obfuscated or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package setup but includes behavior that executes an external executable located within the package after installation, which can be malicious or maliciously tampered. This behavior is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes such as backdoor installation or system compromise, especially if the executable is malicious or injected after package publication.",
