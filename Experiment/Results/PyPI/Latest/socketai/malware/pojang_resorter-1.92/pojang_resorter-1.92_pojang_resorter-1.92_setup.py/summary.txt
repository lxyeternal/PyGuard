  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by executing an external executable during installation without validation, representing a high security risk. This pattern is commonly associated with malware or backdoors. The high malware and risk scores are justified, and such behavior should be flagged as unsafe. Users should avoid installing packages with this pattern unless the executable's purpose and source are verified."
