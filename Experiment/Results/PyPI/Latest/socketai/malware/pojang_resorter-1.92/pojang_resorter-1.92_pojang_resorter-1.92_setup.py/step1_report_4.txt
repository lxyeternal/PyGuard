  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to run a specific executable after package installation.",
  "sources": "The code constructs the path to 'your_executable.exe' within the installed package directory and checks for its existence.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the external executable via subprocess.run([exe_path], check=True).",
  "flows": "The code builds the executable path during installation, then conditionally runs it if present.",
  "anomalies": "Running an executable located within the package directory during installation can be suspicious; the executable's purpose is unknown, and this behavior could be used maliciously to execute arbitrary code during setup.",
  "analysis": "The script extends the standard setup installation to include a custom command that attempts to run an executable file within the package directory. It constructs the path to 'your_executable.exe' inside 'pojang_resorter' directory, verifies its existence, and executes it if found. This behavior is potentially malicious, especially if the executable's purpose is untrusted or unknown, as it executes code during installation without clear justification. The code does not include any validation, logging, or security checks for the executable. The intention appears to be to run a binary post-install, which can be used maliciously to compromise the target system or perform unwanted actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external executable during package installation without transparent justification, posing a significant security risk. This behavior could be malicious if the executable is harmful or untrusted. It warrants further investigation of the executable's origin and purpose before use.",
