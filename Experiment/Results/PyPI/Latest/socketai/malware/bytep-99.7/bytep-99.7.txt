      "conclusion": "The main security concern is executing 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' is compromised. The current reports recognize this pattern as suspicious; however, the malware and security risk scores should be increased to better reflect the high potential for malicious activity. Overall, this pattern is a significant supply chain security risk and warrants caution."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious external domains, representing high malicious potential and privacy risk. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores, with no obfuscation present. The assessments are consistent, but scores should be slightly increased to reflect the clear exfiltration activity."
