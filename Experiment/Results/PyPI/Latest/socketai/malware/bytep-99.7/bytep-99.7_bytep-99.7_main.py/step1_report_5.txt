  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs for monitoring or tracking purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, username, and current working directory.",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests with collected data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, directory) -> URL parameters -> HTTP request to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple suspicious, non-standard URLs that may be command and control or tracking servers. Collects and transmits system info without user consent or notification. No authentication or encryption is used for data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers environment details (hostname, username, current directory) and generates a random number for each request. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends GET requests to potentially malicious or suspicious domains. The URLs are unusual and could be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or command and control. The use of try-except block suppresses errors, which could hide malicious activity. There are no indications of obfuscation or payload execution, but the pattern of sending system info to external servers is suspicious and typical in covert tracking or data theft operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to exfiltrate system details to external servers under the guise of normal operations. The URLs are suspicious and indicative of tracking or malicious command and control infrastructure. The behavior suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious activity for privacy violations.",
