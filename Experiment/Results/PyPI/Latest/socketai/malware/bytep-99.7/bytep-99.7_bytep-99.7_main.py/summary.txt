  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious external domains, representing high malicious potential and privacy risk. The behavior warrants high malware and security risk scores, with no obfuscation present. The assessments are consistent, but scores should be slightly increased to reflect the clear exfiltration activity."
