  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current directory) + random number -> URL query parameters -> HTTP request to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Sending system info to multiple external domains without user consent; no apparent user interaction or permission checks; hardcoded URLs; usage of random number as identifier",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current working directory, then generates a random number. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to three external domains. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely malicious or tracking in nature. The data transmitted could be used for fingerprinting or other unauthorized monitoring. There are no obfuscations or complex code structures, but the intent to send system info to external servers without clear purpose is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system data and sends it to potentially malicious or tracking domains without user consent, indicating malicious intent or privacy invasion. It does not contain obfuscation but performs potentially harmful data exfiltration.",
