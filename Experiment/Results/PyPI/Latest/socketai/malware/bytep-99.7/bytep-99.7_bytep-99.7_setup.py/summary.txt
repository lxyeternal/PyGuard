  "conclusion": "The main security concern is executing 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' is compromised. The current reports recognize this pattern as suspicious; however, the malware and security risk scores should be increased to better reflect the high potential for malicious activity. Overall, this pattern is a significant supply chain security risk and warrants caution."
