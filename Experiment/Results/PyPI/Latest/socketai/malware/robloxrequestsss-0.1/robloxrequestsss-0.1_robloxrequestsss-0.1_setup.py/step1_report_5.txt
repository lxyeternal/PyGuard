{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to extend the installation process to download and execute an external script from a remote URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network via the PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command to download a file from a Dropbox URL. It also reads the current working directory to save the file.",
  "sinks": "The code executes shell commands using subprocess.run, which runs PowerShell commands to download and open a potentially malicious script. It also executes 'pythonw.exe' with the downloaded script as an argument, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "The source (network download) feeds into the sink (execution of the downloaded script via PowerShell and pythonw.exe). If the download is successful, the script is executed without any verification or sandboxing, representing a direct flow from untrusted source to code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes dynamically downloading and executing code during installation without user consent, hardcoded URL to a Dropbox file, and running potentially arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The script uses PowerShell commands with embedded URLs and file paths, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code modifies the package installation process to include a step where it downloads a script from an external URL using PowerShell. It then attempts to execute this script via 'pythonw.exe', which runs without a console window. The URL is hardcoded and points to a Dropbox file, which could be malicious. The execution of remote code during package installation is highly suspicious and could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or remote control. There is no validation, signature checking, or sandboxing before execution. Overall, this pattern indicates malicious intent or severe security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote script during installation without user consent or verification, posing a high security threat. It is strongly recommended to avoid using or distributing this package.",
