{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes a remote Python script during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current working directory, executes a PowerShell command to download a file from a remote URL, and then attempts to open and execute that file using PowerShell commands.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run commands executing PowerShell scripts that download and execute code from an external URL, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "Code retrieves environment data (current directory), then downloads a remote script, and if successful, executes it via PowerShell, creating a source-to-sink path that results in remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Download URL points to a Dropbox link, which could be suspicious. The code executes downloaded content without validation, which is a security risk. No error handling or validation of the downloaded script is present.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to download a script from an external URL during installation. It then executes the downloaded script without verification. The use of PowerShell commands to download and run code dynamically suggests malicious intent or at least dangerous behavior. No obfuscation or benign purpose is apparent; the actions resemble remote code execution. The code does not sanitize or verify the downloaded content, creating a significant security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during installation without validation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. This pattern is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
