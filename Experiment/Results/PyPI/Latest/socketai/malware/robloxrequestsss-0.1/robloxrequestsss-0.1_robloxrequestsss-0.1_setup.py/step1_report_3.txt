{
  "purpose": "This code customizes the installation process of a Python package to download and execute an external script from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), subprocess.run(), the URL in the PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing PowerShell commands, starting a process with 'pythonw.exe' to run the downloaded script",
  "flows": "The code retrieves a URL, saves it to a local file, then executes that file via 'pythonw.exe', potentially executing remote code",
  "anomalies": "Downloads and executes a script from an external, potentially untrusted source during package installation; no validation or sandboxing; use of PowerShell commands in a subprocess; hardcoded URL and filename",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to download a script from a Dropbox URL using PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest. If successful, it launches the downloaded script silently with 'pythonw.exe'. This behavior is embedded in the package installation process, which is unusual and risky. The direct download and execution of external code without validation or user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent or supply chain attack potential. The code does not check the integrity or authenticity of the remote script. Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess increases risk of command injection, although in this case, the URL and commands are hardcoded. The code does not log or warn about the external download and execution, making it highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing remote code during package installation without validation. It likely aims to run arbitrary code from an external source, which poses a serious security risk. This pattern suggests malicious intent or an attempt to compromise systems where the package is installed.",
