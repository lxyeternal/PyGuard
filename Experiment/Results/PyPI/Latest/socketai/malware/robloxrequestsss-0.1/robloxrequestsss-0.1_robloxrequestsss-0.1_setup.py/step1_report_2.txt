  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to download and execute an external Python script from a remote URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), subprocess.run(), URL in Invoke-WebRequest command, output_file path",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run() executing PowerShell commands to download and run a remote script",
  "flows": "os.getcwd() -> download_command (via Invoke-WebRequest) -> download_result -> file existence check -> open_command (via Start-Process 'pythonw.exe') -> execute remote script",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download of external script during installation, executing remote code without verification, use of PowerShell commands with hardcoded URL, no validation or sandboxing of the downloaded script",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that downloads a script from a remote URL using PowerShell and then executes it with pythonw.exe, a silent Python process. This behavior occurs during package installation, which could allow arbitrary code execution from an external source. The download URL is hardcoded, and the script is run without validation or user consent. The code does not perform any checks on the downloaded content, nor does it verify the source's trustworthiness. This pattern strongly indicates malicious intent or supply chain sabotage, as it can execute arbitrary code on the user's system during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code downloads and executes external code during installation without validation, representing a high security risk and potential malicious behavior. It is likely intended for malicious purposes such as remote code execution or system compromise.",
