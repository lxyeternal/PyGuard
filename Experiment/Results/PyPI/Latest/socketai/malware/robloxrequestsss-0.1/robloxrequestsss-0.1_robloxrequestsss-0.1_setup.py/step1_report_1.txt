{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external script during package installation",
  "sources": "The code reads external data from a URL via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest, and reads/writes files in the filesystem",
  "sinks": "It executes a downloaded script using PowerShell Start-Process with 'pythonw.exe', potentially executing untrusted code",
  "flows": "External URL -> downloaded file -> executed by pythonw.exe",
  "anomalies": "Download URL points to a Dropbox link with query parameters; the code executes downloaded content without validation or sandboxing; usage of PowerShell commands for download and execution; no verification or signature checks of the downloaded file",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during installation, constructs a PowerShell command to download a script from a Dropbox URL to a local file named '634364.pyw'. If the download is successful, it runs the downloaded script silently using 'pythonw.exe'. This behavior indicates automatic fetching and execution of remote code during package installation, which is suspicious. There are no input validation, no signature verification, and no user consent prompts. The usage of external commands and automatic execution of remote code suggest malicious intent or at least potentially harmful behavior. The code does not appear to be obfuscated but contains dynamic code execution patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs an unsolicited download and execution of a remote script during package installation, indicating high malicious potential. It bypasses typical security checks and could be used to deliver malware or malicious payloads silently. The behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior.",
