  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious activity by downloading and executing external scripts during package installation without validation, indicative of supply chain attack behavior. All reports correctly identify this pattern. The malware and security risk scores should be set to 1 to reflect the high threat level. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, this pattern is highly dangerous and should be flagged as malicious."
