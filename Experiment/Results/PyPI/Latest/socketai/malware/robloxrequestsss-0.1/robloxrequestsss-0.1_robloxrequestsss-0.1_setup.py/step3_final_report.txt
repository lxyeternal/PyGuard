{
  "purpose": "The code downloads a remote script from a Dropbox URL during package installation and executes it silently using pythonw.exe, without validation or user consent.",
  "sources": "The URL in the subprocess command constructing the Invoke-WebRequest call; the output file path; the execution command for pythonw.exe.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded script via Start-Process with pythonw.exe, leading to remote code execution without validation.",
  "flows": "From the hardcoded Dropbox URL → download script to local file → execute script silently with pythonw.exe.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of external code during package install; no validation or signature checks; use of PowerShell commands via subprocess with shell=True; hardcoded URL; silent execution without user prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, constructs and runs a PowerShell command to download a script from a remote URL. If successful, it executes the script silently with pythonw.exe. There is no validation, signature verification, or user prompt before execution. The URL is hardcoded and contains query parameters, typical of Dropbox shared links. The subprocess calls use shell=True, which can be risky but are constructed from fixed strings. This pattern indicates malicious intent, characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The behavior is highly suspicious, with high confidence that it is malicious. The malware score should be 1, and the security risk score should be 1, as the code performs remote code execution during installation without safeguards.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious activity by downloading and executing external scripts during package installation without validation, indicative of supply chain attack behavior. All reports correctly identify this pattern. The malware and security risk scores should be set to 1 to reflect the high threat level. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. Overall, this pattern is highly dangerous and should be flagged as malicious.",
