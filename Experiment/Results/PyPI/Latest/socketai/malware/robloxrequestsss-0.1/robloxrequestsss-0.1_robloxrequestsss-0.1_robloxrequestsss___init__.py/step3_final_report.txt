  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static output only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; trivial and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single print statement with no external dependencies, inputs, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's behavior. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No further action or concern is warranted.",
