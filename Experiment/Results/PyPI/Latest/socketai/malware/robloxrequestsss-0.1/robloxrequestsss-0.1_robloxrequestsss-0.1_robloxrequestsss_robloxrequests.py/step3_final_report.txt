  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'hello' with no external input or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from any source.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data flows or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists as there are no sources or sinks in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward print statement with no external dependencies, data inputs, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence levels are high, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected or suspected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
