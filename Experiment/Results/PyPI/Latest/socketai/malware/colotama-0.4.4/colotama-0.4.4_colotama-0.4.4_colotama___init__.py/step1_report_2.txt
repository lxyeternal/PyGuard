{
  "purpose": "Initialize the package and invoke the command-line interface (CLI)",
  "sources": "Import statement from the 'cli' module",
  "sinks": "Calling the 'cli()' function, which could potentially execute arbitrary code if the function is malicious",
  "flows": "Import 'cli' from the module, then invoke 'cli()' directly",
  "anomalies": "The code directly executes 'cli()' upon import, which can be unusual if not expected; however, no malicious or suspicious behavior is apparent in this snippet alone",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'cli' function from a local module and immediately executes it. The immediate invocation can be standard for CLI applications but could pose risks if the 'cli()' function contains malicious code or unwanted behavior. There are no indications of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity in this small snippet. Without the implementation details of 'cli()', we cannot definitively assess its safety, but based solely on this code, it appears to be a straightforward pattern used in CLI packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical entry point for a CLI application that imports and runs a command-line interface. No malicious behavior is evident from this fragment alone; however, caution should be exercised to review the actual implementation of the 'cli()' function to ensure safety.",
