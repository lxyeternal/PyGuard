  "purpose": "Initialize the package and invoke the command-line interface (CLI)",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'cli' from the local 'cli' module",
  "sinks": "Calling 'cli()' function executes the CLI, which may process untrusted command-line input",
  "flows": "Import 'cli' -> call 'cli()' when module is imported/executed",
  "anomalies": "Simple invocation of a CLI function; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'cli' function or object from a local module and immediately invokes it upon import or execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious code patterns. The immediate execution of 'cli()' suggests it is intended to run the command-line interface, typical in CLI-based Python packages. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization that runs a CLI. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
