  "flows": "Import of 'cli' -> execution of 'cli()' upon module load",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward CLI pattern; no obfuscation or secrets in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard CLI entry point pattern. It imports a 'cli' function and executes it immediately, which is common but warrants review of 'cli()' implementation for security. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The security implications depend entirely on what 'cli()' does, which is not provided. The code itself is benign, and the pattern is typical for CLI tools. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are appropriate given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The risk is minimal and the scores are justified. The actual security assessment depends on the implementation of 'cli()', which should be reviewed separately. Overall, the code fragment is safe.",
