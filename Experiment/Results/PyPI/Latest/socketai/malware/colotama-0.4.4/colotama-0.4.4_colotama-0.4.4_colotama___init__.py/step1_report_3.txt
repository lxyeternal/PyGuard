  "purpose": "To initialize the package and execute the CLI command when imported.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .cli, and the call to cli()",
  "sinks": "The call to cli() may execute external code or commands depending on its implementation",
  "flows": "Import .cli module -> execute cli() function",
  "anomalies": "Direct execution of cli() upon module import can be considered unusual but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'cli' and immediately executes its 'cli()' function. This pattern can be used for CLI tools to automatically run when the module is run or imported. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are visible within this snippet. Without the implementation details of 'cli()', it is not possible to fully assess potential malicious behavior, but the code structure itself is straightforward and typical for CLI entry points.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as an entry point for a CLI application, executing the 'cli()' function upon import. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The immediate invocation of 'cli()' could be unusual but is common in CLI scripts.",
