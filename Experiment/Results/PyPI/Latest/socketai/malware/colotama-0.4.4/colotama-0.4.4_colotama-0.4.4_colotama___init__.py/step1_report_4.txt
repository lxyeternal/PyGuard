  "flows": "Importing cli -> executing cli() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in this snippet; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'cli' function or object from a local module and then immediately executes it. Without inspecting the actual implementation of 'cli', it is not possible to determine whether this function contains malicious behavior. The pattern is typical for CLI entry points, which simply invoke user commands. There are no suspicious code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or unusual operations visible in this fragment. The primary concern is whether the 'cli' function itself is malicious, but that cannot be assessed from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as an entry point to run a CLI application. Based solely on this snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior. However, the execution of 'cli()' depends entirely on its implementation, which is not provided. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident here.",
