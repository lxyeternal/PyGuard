  "purpose": "Initialize the package by importing and executing the command-line interface (CLI) function",
  "sources": "Import statement for '.cli' module and call to 'cli()'",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'cli()' which may run arbitrary code based on user input or command-line arguments",
  "flows": "Import of 'cli' from '.cli' module -> invocation of 'cli()' function",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward initialization code",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'cli' function from the local '.cli' module and immediately executes it. This is typical for CLI-based Python packages, where running the package's main entry point triggers command-line processing. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or data leaks visible here. The only potential concern is that 'cli()' may execute user-provided commands, but this is standard for CLI apps and does not constitute malicious code by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard initialization script for a command-line tool. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks on its own. Its security profile depends on the implementation of the 'cli()' function in the '.cli' module, which is not provided here.",
