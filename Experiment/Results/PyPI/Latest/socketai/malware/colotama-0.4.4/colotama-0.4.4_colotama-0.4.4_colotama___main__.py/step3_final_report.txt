  "purpose": "Attempt to import 'pyprettifier' and instantiate 'EmojiConverter'; log import errors to a fixed temporary file if import fails.",

  "flows": "Import attempt -> Exception handling -> Writing error message to '/tmp/a'.",
  "anomalies": "Logging error messages to a fixed file '/tmp/a', which could potentially leak information but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import and error logging. No network activity, code injection, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present. The error logging to a fixed file is unconventional but not malicious. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern primarily due to error message leakage potential. The code's simplicity and benign behavior are consistent across all reports. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import with error logging. The only minor concern is the use of a fixed temporary file for error messages, which could leak information but does not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
