  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing an external 'colotama' script during installation without validation poses a significant security risk. This behavior could be exploited to run malicious code if the 'colotama' file is compromised. The use of subprocess with shell=True and dynamic command construction is dangerous and aligns with common supply chain attack vectors. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score of around 0.75 and a security risk of approximately 0.8 accurately reflect the potential threat. Further investigation into the 'colotama' script's content is recommended, and such execution patterns should be avoided or secured to prevent malicious exploitation."
