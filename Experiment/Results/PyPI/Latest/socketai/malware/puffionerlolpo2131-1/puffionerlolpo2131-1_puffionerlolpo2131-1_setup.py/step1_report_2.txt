{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package and includes custom commands to execute a specific script during installation, development, or egg info generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for package metadata and executes a system command via os.system() within the custom_command() function.",
  "sinks": "The custom_command() function executes a system command that makes an HTTP request with an access token retrieved from Google Cloud metadata, then posts this token to an external URL (webhook.site).",
  "flows": "The flow involves executing the custom_command() during install, develop, or egg_info commands, where it retrieves a token and transmits it externally.",
  "anomalies": "The custom_command() function retrieves a token from cloud metadata and immediately posts it to an external server, which is unusual for a typical setup script. The use of os.system() to run a complex shell command that includes curl commands to external URLs is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script primarily defines package metadata and custom commands. The critical anomaly is in custom_command(), which executes a shell command that fetches an access token from Google Cloud metadata server and sends it via HTTP POST to an external URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, potentially stealing cloud instance credentials. The inclusion of this command in install, develop, and egg_info lifecycle methods indicates it runs during package setup phases, which could be an attempt to surreptitiously gather credentials without user awareness. There are no other suspicious code elements or obfuscated parts; the rest of the script is standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior where it exfiltrates cloud instance credentials by fetching a token from the Google Cloud metadata server and sending it to an external webhook during package setup. This behavior suggests the package is intended for malicious data theft rather than legitimate purposes.",
