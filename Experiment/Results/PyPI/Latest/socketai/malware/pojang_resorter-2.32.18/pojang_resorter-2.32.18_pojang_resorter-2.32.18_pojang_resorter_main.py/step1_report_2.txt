  "purpose": "The script provides a CLI interface to execute specific Python scripts based on user commands, primarily related to server initialization, preview, help display, and operator assignment.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line argument 'command', reads script files from the same directory based on command mapping.",
  "sinks": "Executes other Python scripts via subprocess.run, potentially executing untrusted code if scripts are malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> command mapping -> script path check -> subprocess execution of script",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, but relies on external scripts execution; no validation of script contents. Uses subprocess to execute scripts which could be malicious if scripts are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up logging and provides a command-line interface with predefined commands. It maps commands to script filenames and executes them via subprocess. It defaults to 'initialize_server' if no command is given. The use of subprocess.run to execute scripts based on user input is a potential risk if the script files are malicious or altered, as this could lead to execution of arbitrary code. No code obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behaviors like network connections or data exfiltration are present. The reliance on external scripts without validation is a minor concern, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code itself appears straightforward and legitimate, with the main risk tied to the external scripts it executes.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a command dispatcher for executing specific scripts. It does not contain malicious code itself but has an inherent risk if external scripts are compromised. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior within this code snippet. The security concern mainly relates to executing external scripts without validation.",
