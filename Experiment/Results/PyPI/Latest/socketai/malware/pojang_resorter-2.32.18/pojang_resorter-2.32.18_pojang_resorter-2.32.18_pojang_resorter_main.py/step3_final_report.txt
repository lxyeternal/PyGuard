  "purpose": "A command-line interface tool that maps user commands to specific scripts and executes them via subprocess.",
  "sources": "User command input via argparse; script existence check in the same directory.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external scripts through subprocess.run(), which could run malicious code if scripts are compromised.",
  "flows": "User inputs command -> command mapped via command_map -> script path constructed -> script exists -> subprocess.run() executes script.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; straightforward command dispatch.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple command dispatcher that executes predefined scripts based on user input. It uses a static command map and checks for script existence before execution. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main security concern is executing external scripts, which could be malicious if those scripts are compromised. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as no malicious activity is detected within this code. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code clarity. The risk score, ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 in the reports, reflects moderate concern due to external script execution but is justified assuming scripts are trustworthy. The code itself is benign, and the primary risk depends on external dependencies. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no changes are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI command dispatcher with minimal inherent security risk. The main concern is the trustworthiness of external scripts it executes. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the risk score at approximately 0.2, which aligns with the current reports and analysis.",
