{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for the Python project 'pojang_resorter'.",
  "sources": "Static configuration data within the setup() function, including package list, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or output handling occurs in this script.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; configuration is static and does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; dependencies are standard, and the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The setup script is a typical Python package configuration. It specifies dependencies, entry points, and Python version requirements without executing any code beyond static configuration. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The security implications depend on the implementation of the main module, which is outside this script. All dependencies are common packages used for GUI automation, image processing, networking, and testing. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the trustworthiness of dependencies, which are standard. The code itself is safe, and the scores should reflect this.",
