  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code is purely configuration; no code execution or external data handling occurs.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or suspicious activity; the code is standard setup configuration.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly assessed as benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no code execution or malicious logic.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The setup script only specifies dependencies and entry points; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** The report notes that the entry point executes a function which could contain malicious code, but the setup script itself does not include that code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly states that the setup code is benign but emphasizes that the actual behavior depends on the implementation of `pojang_resorter.main:main`.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. This is reasonable because the setup script itself does not perform malicious actions.\n- **Justification:** The risk is associated with the code executed at runtime, not the setup configuration.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; no malicious activity is evident in the setup script.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no malicious code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** All zero, matching the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The setup script is standard, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the setup script is standard and does not contain malicious code.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, as expected.\n- The security risk scores are 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The setup script is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependencies are common and do not indicate malicious behavior by themselves. The only potential concern is the code executed at runtime (`pojang_resorter.main:main`), which must be reviewed separately, but that is outside the scope of this setup configuration.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
