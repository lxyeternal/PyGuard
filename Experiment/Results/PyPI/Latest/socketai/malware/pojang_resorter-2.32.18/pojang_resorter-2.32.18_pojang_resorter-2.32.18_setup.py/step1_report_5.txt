{
  "purpose": "The setup script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'pojang_resorter', including its dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from the 'install_requires' list and package configuration details from 'setup()'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The script does not contain any data sinks or untrusted data handling. It merely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the script only specifies static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscated content are present. All code is straightforward configuration for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All dependencies are common packages related to GUI automation, image processing, HTTP requests, and testing. No code execution, dynamic code, or malicious constructs are evident. The script does not perform any runtime actions beyond configuration. It does not read or write external data during execution, nor does it contain any suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign and intended solely for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden functionality, or security risks within this code.",
