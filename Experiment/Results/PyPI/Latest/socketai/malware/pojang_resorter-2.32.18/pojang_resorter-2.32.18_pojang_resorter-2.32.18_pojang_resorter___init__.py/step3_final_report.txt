{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a package initializer or entry point, providing metadata and importing the main functionality for the 'Pojang Resorter' CLI tool.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .main import main' and the static variables '__version__' and '__author__'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "Import of local module '.main' without data flow to external systems; static metadata variables do not influence data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package module that imports a local 'main' function and sets static metadata variables. It contains no user input handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The import is from a local module, typical for package entry points. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty of the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing assessments and scores are accurate. No modifications are necessary; the code poses no security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
