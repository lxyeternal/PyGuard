  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, including version and author information.",
  "sources": "Importing main module from the same package",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data leaks present",
  "flows": "No data flows observed, as the code only imports a module and sets metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and primarily includes metadata and a single import statement. It imports the 'main' function or module from the local package, which is typical for CLI tools. No user input handling, network calls, or data processing occurs in this snippet. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple entry point or metadata holder for the CLI package with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
