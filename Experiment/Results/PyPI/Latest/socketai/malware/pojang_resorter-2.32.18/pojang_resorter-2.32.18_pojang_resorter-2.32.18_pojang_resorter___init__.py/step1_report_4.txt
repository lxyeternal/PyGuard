  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, including importing the main function and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, version and author string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports a function and sets metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and primarily sets package metadata and imports a main function. There are no input handling, no data processing, and no execution of untrusted code. The import from a local module is typical for package structure. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of a package initialization script, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
