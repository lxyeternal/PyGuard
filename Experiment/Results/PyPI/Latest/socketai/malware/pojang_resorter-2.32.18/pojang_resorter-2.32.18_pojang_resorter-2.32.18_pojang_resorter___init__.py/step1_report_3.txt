  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static metadata and import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely sets metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a module docstring, an import statement, and version/author metadata. No external data inputs, no execution of dynamic or untrusted data, no network interactions, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. It appears to be a straightforward package descriptor and import statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module initializer and metadata provider with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
