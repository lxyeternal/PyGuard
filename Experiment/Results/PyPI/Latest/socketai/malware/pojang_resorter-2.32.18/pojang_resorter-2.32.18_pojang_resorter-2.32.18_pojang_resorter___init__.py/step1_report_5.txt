  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool by importing main functionality and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'main' function from a local module '.main'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal, straightforward, and contains no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a main function from a local module and sets version and author metadata. It lacks any user input, external data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The minimal structure suggests it is part of a larger project, but on its own, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup with metadata and import statement, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a harmless part of a larger application.",
