{
  "purpose": "Send private key data to a remote API endpoint and check a switcher value from another endpoint.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'private_key' and the request to 'https://6788db412c874e66b7d693b7.mockapi.io/tron'.",
  "sinks": "The POST request sending 'transaction_data' containing the private key to an external server.",
  "flows": "The 'private_key' flows into 'transaction_data', which is sent via POST request to an external API; the response from a GET request to another external endpoint influences the return value.",
  "anomalies": "The private key is sent directly over the network without encryption or obfuscation, indicating potential data leakage. The endpoint URL appears suspicious and is not a known domain; the key is included in the payload with a misspelled key 'ptivat_key'.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a private key as input and sends it directly to an external API endpoint via POST request, which is a security concern as it may leak sensitive information. The misspelling 'ptivat_key' suggests either a typo or an attempt to obfuscate. The subsequent GET request retrieves data from another endpoint, and its JSON response determines the return value. There are no input validation, encryption, or security measures. The URL appears suspicious and potentially malicious, designed to exfiltrate private keys or sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code potentially leaks private keys to an external server without protection, which is a serious security risk. The suspicious URL and direct transmission of sensitive data point toward malicious intent or a supply chain security breach. The overall risk is high, and the code should be considered malicious or dangerous.",
