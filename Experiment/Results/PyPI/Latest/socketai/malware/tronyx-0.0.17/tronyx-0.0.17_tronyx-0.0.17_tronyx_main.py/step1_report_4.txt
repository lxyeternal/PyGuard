{
  "purpose": "Send transaction data containing a private key to an external API and retrieve switcher status",
  "sources": "The function receives 'private_key' as input and uses it directly in the request payload",
  "sinks": "Requests to external API endpoints, transmitting private key data and retrieving switcher status",
  "flows": "Input 'private_key' flows into the transaction_data payload, which is sent via POST request; response from switcher API is fetched and used in control flow",
  "anomalies": "The private key is hardcoded into the data payload, transmitted in plaintext; the endpoint URLs are obfuscated or generic, potential for malicious intent; no validation or encryption of sensitive data",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'perm' that takes a private key as input. It constructs a data payload containing the private key, albeit with a typo ('ptivat_key' instead of 'private_key'). It then sends this data to an external mock API via POST, potentially exposing sensitive credentials. The code also performs a GET request to fetch a 'switcher' status and returns 1 or 0 based on its response. The direct transmission of a private key over an external request is highly suspicious and indicates possible malicious behavior, such as private key theft or exfiltration. No encryption, validation, or safeguards are present. The use of external endpoints and the manner of data handling raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates a private key to an external API without protection, indicating malicious intent or security negligence. It could be part of a malicious supply chain component designed to steal sensitive data.",
