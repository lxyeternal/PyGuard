  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library named 'tronyx'. It reads a local README.md for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and repository URL.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file; static package metadata and dependencies; repository URL.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network inputs; no code execution or dynamic behavior.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md (source) does not lead to any data leak or malicious action; static data used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and follows standard practices; no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static imports, reading a local file, and defining package metadata. No dynamic code, user input, or network activity is present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The repository URL is public, and dependencies are standard. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident. The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature. Overall, the script poses no security threat and is a standard packaging configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
