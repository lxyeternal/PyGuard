{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'tronyx' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static strings for package metadata; 'requests' dependency specified in install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input; no data leaks or external code execution points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; static data used for setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code follows standard setup.py structure with no unusual patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a README.md file for the long description, specifies package dependencies, and sets package metadata such as name, version, author, and URL. All actions involve static or controlled data; no user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution present. The package dependencies are standard, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup script for packaging a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
