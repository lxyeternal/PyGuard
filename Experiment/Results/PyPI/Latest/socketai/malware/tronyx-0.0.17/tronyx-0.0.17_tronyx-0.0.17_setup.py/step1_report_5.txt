{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package named 'tronyx', used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package dependencies via 'install_requires'; reads metadata such as author and project URL.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external commands executed.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flows; standard package setup process with static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools, reads a local README file for long description, and configures package metadata including name, version, dependencies, author info, and project URL. There are no dynamic code executions, external commands, or suspicious data handling. The package dependencies are explicitly specified. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
