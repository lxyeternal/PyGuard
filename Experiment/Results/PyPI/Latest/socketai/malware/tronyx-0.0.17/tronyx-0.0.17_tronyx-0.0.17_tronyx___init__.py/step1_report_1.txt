  "purpose": "The code imports the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'perm' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, with no evident anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. There are no additional lines, no data handling, no user input, no environment variable usage, and no network activity. Due to its minimal nature, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The import appears standard and benign, assuming the 'main' module and 'perm' object are legitimate and intended parts of the project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code, and there is no indication of malware or security concerns in this fragment.",
