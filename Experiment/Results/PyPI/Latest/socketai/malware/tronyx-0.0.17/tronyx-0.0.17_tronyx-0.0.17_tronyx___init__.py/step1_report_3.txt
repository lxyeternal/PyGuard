  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'perm' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as data output or network communication are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No flow analysis possible with only an import statement; data flow depends on how 'perm' is used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports 'perm' from a local module called 'main'. It does not execute any code, perform data processing, or interact with external systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, network activity, or obfuscated code. Due to the limited content, analysis of potential malicious use depends on how 'perm' is used downstream, which is not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no evident malicious intent or security risks. It is benign in isolation but should be reviewed in the context of its usage in the larger codebase.",
