  "purpose": "The code imports a function or variable named 'perm' from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing a local module 'main' and its 'perm' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are evident in this single line.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink path identified; import statement alone does not indicate malicious flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a relative module, which is a common practice in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The lack of additional context limits assessment, but based solely on this line, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal import statement is standard Python code with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
