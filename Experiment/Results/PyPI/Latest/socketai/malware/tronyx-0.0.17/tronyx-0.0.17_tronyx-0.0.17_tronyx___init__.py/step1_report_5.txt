  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement importing 'perm' from a local module 'main'. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no code execution beyond static import. Since this is only a fragment, it provides no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns. As it is just an import, it cannot be malicious on its own.",
