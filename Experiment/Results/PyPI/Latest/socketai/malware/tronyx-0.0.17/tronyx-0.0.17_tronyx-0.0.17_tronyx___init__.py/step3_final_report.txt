  "purpose": "Minimal import statement from a local module, likely benign.",
  "sources": "Import statement itself; no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports a symbol from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import of 'perm' from '.main'. It contains no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, with very low security risk scores (~0.1). The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the minimal and standard code structure. No signs of malicious intent, code injection, or data leakage are present. The code's security posture is very low risk, and scores are consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or obfuscating elements. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary; the overall security risk remains negligible.",
