  "purpose": "The code executes a custom install process that runs main() from main.py during setup, which is unconventional and potentially risky.",
  "sources": "The run() method in CrazyInstallStrat class, specifically the import and execution of main() from main.py.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() during installation, which could run malicious code if main.py is compromised.",
  "flows": "After standard installation, the code imports main from main.py and executes main(), creating a source-to-sink flow during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Running arbitrary code during setup without validation, placeholder metadata ('xxx'), and executing external scripts during install.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, after completing standard installation, imports and runs main() from main.py. This pattern is unusual and risky because it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, which could be exploited if main.py contains malicious code. The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The risk depends entirely on the contents of main.py, which are unknown. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.25-0.5, security risk 0.4-0.75) are reasonable given the pattern, but higher scores (malware 0.6-0.75, security risk 0.75) could be justified considering the potential for malicious activity. The obfuscated score remains 0, consistent with the code clarity. Overall, the pattern of executing external code during setup warrants caution, and the current scores reflect a moderate to high risk, especially if main.py is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially without validation. The scores assigned are appropriate but could be slightly increased to reflect the high risk of arbitrary code execution during setup. This package should be treated with caution until the contents of main.py are inspected.",
