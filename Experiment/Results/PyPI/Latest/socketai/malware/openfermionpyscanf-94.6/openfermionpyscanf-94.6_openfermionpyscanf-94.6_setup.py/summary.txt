  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially without validation. The scores assigned are appropriate but could be slightly increased to reflect the high risk of arbitrary code execution during setup. This package should be treated with caution until the contents of main.py are inspected."
