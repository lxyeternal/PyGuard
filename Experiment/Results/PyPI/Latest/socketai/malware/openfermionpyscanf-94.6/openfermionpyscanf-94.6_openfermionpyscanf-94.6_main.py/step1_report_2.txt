  "purpose": "The script collects system information including hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then encodes the MAC addresses and sends this data to specific external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads system network interfaces to get MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with query parameters containing system information.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (system info, MAC addresses) is collected, processed (base64 encoding), and then sent via URL requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs, dynamic URL construction with random number and system data, no validation or encryption of data, and broad exception handling that suppresses errors. The URLs suggest potential malicious C2 or data exfiltration domains.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific data such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses by executing system commands. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs with these parameters, including a random number. It then attempts to send this data to multiple external URLs, which are suspicious and appear to be potentially malicious command-and-control or data exfiltration servers. The use of broad exception handling prevents detection of errors during transmission. No user consent or encryption is implemented, and the URLs are obscure and suspicious. The code's behavior aligns with typical data harvesting and exfiltration activity commonly seen in malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious intent by collecting sensitive system data and transmitting it to suspicious external domains without user consent. The pattern of data collection, encoding, and transmission to obscure URLs suggests it functions as a malware component aimed at data exfiltration or remote control.",
