  "purpose": "Collect system information (host name, user, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs as encoded parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), retrieves MAC addresses via system commands.",
  "sinks": "urlopen calls that send data to external URLs with constructed query parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, username, current path, and MAC addresses -> encodes MAC addresses -> constructs URLs with parameters -> sends GET requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and construction of URLs with potentially unique random query parameters each run.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system identifiers, MAC addresses, and user environment details, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this information via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs. The URLs are suspicious, potentially malicious, as they are on known malicious or test domains (oast domains often used in security testing). The code does not perform any malicious actions like executing payloads or establishing backdoors but transmits system info that could be used for fingerprinting or tracking. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present, but the activity suggests fingerprinting or data exfiltration with no clear user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is collecting and exfiltrating system information to external servers, which could be used for malicious purposes such as tracking, fingerprinting, or further exploitation. The code itself does not contain direct malicious payloads but performs potentially malicious data transmission, warranting a security alert.",
