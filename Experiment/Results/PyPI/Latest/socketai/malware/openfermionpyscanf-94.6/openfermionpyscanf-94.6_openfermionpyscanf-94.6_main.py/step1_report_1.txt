  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory, and send it to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (which reads network interface info), and the hardcoded URLs for data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send collected data to remote servers with constructed URLs.",
  "flows": "Data from system info functions (hostname, username, directory, MAC addresses) is encoded and included as URL parameters in HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used appear suspicious and are likely malicious or used for tracking/data exfiltration. The MAC addresses are base64-encoded before transmission, possibly to obscure the data. The code collects multiple system identifiers and sends them over HTTP without user consent or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system identifiers such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses from network interfaces across Windows, Linux, and macOS. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 to obfuscate the raw data. It then constructs URLs pointing to external domains (likely malicious or tracking servers) and sends the data via HTTP GET requests. No input validation or user consent is present. The use of hardcoded external URLs and data exfiltration via GET requests indicates malicious intent or tracking. The code does not appear to perform any legitimate function and seems designed for stealthy data collection and potential malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system information and exfiltrating it to suspicious external servers without user consent. The use of encoding and specific URLs suggests an intent to hide or obscure the data. Overall, this script should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
