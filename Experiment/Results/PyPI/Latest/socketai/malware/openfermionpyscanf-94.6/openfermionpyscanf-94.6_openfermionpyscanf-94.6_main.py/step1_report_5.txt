  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses; encode MAC addresses; send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network info",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data to external URLs",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and MAC addresses) are encoded and appended as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains, encoding MAC addresses and system info, no data validation, silent exception handling; no clear purpose stated; external URLs do not appear legitimate",
  "analysis": "The code gathers detailed system info including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are base64 encoded. It constructs URLs with these parameters and makes HTTP GET requests to three potentially malicious or suspicious domains. The absence of any data validation or encryption beyond base64, combined with the use of unusual domains, indicates possible data exfiltration. The try-except blocks suppress errors, which can hide failures or malicious activity. Overall, the code appears designed to collect user and system data and send it to external servers without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious due to its covert data collection and exfiltration behavior to suspicious external URLs. It encodes and transmits system identifiers without validation, and the domain names are suspicious. The overall security risk is high, indicating a likely malicious intent.",
