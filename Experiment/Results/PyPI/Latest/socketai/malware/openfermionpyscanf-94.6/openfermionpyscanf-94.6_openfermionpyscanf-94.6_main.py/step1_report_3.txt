  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encode the MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple remote URLs as part of a network reporting or tracking mechanism.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), obtaining MAC addresses via system commands, and the random number generator (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests constructed with encoded system data sent to external URLs via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Source data (system info and MAC addresses) is encoded and included as URL parameters in HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains (oast-cn.byted-dast.com, oast-row.byted-dast.com, oast.fun) suggest potential tracking or data exfiltration. Encoding MAC addresses with base64 may obscure the data flow. The URLs are similar and appear to be for redirection or C2 communication. No data validation or encryption beyond base64 is used. The code silently ignores errors during URL requests.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host-specific data and encodes MAC addresses with base64, then constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or tracking domains. It sends data via HTTP GET requests without any user consent or transparency. The domains are suspicious, suggesting possible tracking or exfiltration. The use of system commands to gather MAC addresses varies based on OS, and the code does not perform any validation, encryption, or user notification. There is no clear benign purpose for sending such data to these domains, and the obfuscation through base64 may hide intent. The script appears to function as a data harvesting or potentially malicious beacon, designed to stealthily send system info to remote servers.",
  "conclusion": "The code acts as a potential data exfiltration or tracking tool, collecting system identifiers and sending them to suspicious domains without user awareness. It exhibits behaviors consistent with stealthy information gathering, with no clear benign purpose. The use of suspicious URLs and encoding methods raises security concerns, and it should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
