      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially without validation. The scores assigned are appropriate but could be slightly increased to reflect the high risk of arbitrary code execution during setup. This package should be treated with caution until the contents of main.py are inspected."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior primarily through covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains. The activity is consistent with malware or spyware functions, and the scores in the reports are appropriate. The overall assessment should assign a high malware score (~0.9) and high security risk (~0.9), with no obfuscation (0). The code should be treated as malicious, and such activity warrants investigation or blocking."
