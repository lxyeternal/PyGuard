      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through repeated external network requests to a hardcoded, external URL during import and installation. While no malicious payloads are detected, this pattern is indicative of potential malicious activity, such as tracking or command-and-control signaling. The malware risk is moderate to high, and the security risk is significant due to the unsolicited external contact. The code should be flagged for further review and caution."
