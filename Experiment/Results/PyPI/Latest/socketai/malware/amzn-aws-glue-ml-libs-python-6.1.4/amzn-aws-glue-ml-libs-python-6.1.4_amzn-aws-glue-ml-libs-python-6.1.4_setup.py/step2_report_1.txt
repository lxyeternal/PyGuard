  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `requests` and makes an immediate GET request to `http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python` at module import.\n- Defines a `post_install()` function that performs the same GET request.\n- Creates a custom `PostInstallCommand` class that runs `post_install()` during package installation.\n- The setup() function overrides the install command with this custom class.\n- The URL is hardcoded and external, with no error handling or validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of external network requests** during import and installation.\n- **Repeated requests** to the same external URL.\n- **Unusual behavior** for a setup script, which typically should be side-effect free.\n\n**No evidence of data exfiltration, payload delivery, or obfuscation** is present beyond the GET requests, but the pattern is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Score: malware 0, securityRisk 0.6, confidence 0.7**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the external requests during import and install as suspicious. It notes no malicious payloads but raises security concerns.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score should be increased slightly given the repeated external contact, possibly to 0.3, but not higher as no payload or exfiltration is observed.\n- **Risk score:** Justified at 0.6, as repeated external contact can be used for tracking or C2, but without payload, it's not fully malicious.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Score: malware 0.75, securityRisk 0.75, confidence 0.9**\n- **Assessment:** This report considers the pattern as highly suspicious, suggesting possible command-and-control or exfiltration.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score is high but not at maximum; considering no payload, 0.75 seems reasonable. The risk score aligns with the repeated external contact.\n- **Note:** The report's confidence is high, justified by the pattern.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Score: malware 0.9, securityRisk 0.85, confidence 0.9**\n- **Assessment:** Very similar to report 2, emphasizing malicious intent due to unsolicited requests.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score is high, but since no payload or obfuscation, perhaps slightly overestimated. A score of 0.8 might be more appropriate.\n- **Note:** The risk score of 0.85 is justified given the repeated contact and suspicious URL.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Score: malware 0, securityRisk 0.6, confidence 0.7**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more conservative, noting suspicious behavior but no malicious payload.\n- **Verdict:** Malware score should be increased from 0 to around 0.3 to reflect the suspicious network activity.\n- **Note:** The risk score is justified.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Score: malware 0.2, securityRisk 0.7, confidence 0.8**\n- **Assessment:** Less severe, perhaps considering the request as benign or accidental.\n- **Verdict:** Malware score should be increased to about 0.3–0.4, considering the repeated external requests.\n- **Note:** The security risk is justified, but malware score should be slightly higher.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my own estimates:\n\n| Aspect | Reasoning | Estimated Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Malware** | Repeated external GET requests during import and install, with no payload or obfuscation, suggest tracking or C2. No malicious payloads detected. | **0.4** (moderate suspicion, potential for malicious use) |\n| **Obfuscated** | Code is straightforward; no obfuscation present. | **0** |\n| **Security Risk** | External contact during import and install, URL hardcoded, no user notification, potential for tracking or exfiltration. | **0.75** (high risk) |\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The repeated contact with an external server during import and installation is a significant security concern.\n- No payloads or malicious code execution are present, but the pattern indicates potential malicious intent.\n- The malware score should reflect the suspicious network activity, but without payloads, it shouldn't be maximum.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- **Malware score:** **0.4** — indicates moderate suspicion due to repeated external contact.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** **0.75** — high due to unsolicited external communication during critical setup phases.\n\nThis assessment balances the observed suspicious behavior with the absence of concrete malicious payloads.",
