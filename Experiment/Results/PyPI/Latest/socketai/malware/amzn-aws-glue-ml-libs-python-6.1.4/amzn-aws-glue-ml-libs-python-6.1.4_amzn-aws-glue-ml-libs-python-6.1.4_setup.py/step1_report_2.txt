{
  "purpose": "Package setup script that installs a Python package and performs a network request during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network via requests.get() calls to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python'. It also reads the README.md file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "The network requests to an external server could leak information or perform unwanted actions. Reading from the README file could be benign but is a data source for package metadata.",
  "flows": "The code initiates a GET request at the start (outside of any function), which sends data to an external server. The post_install() function is called during installation, making the same request again, creating a flow from installation to external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request to an external server during module import and during installation, which is unusual for a standard setup script. Repeated requests to the same URL, with no clear purpose or validation, are suspicious. The URL 'http://pov.sh:45111' is potentially suspicious or malicious, especially if it is not documented or expected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party 'requests'. It makes an initial GET request immediately upon import, which could be used to check in with a remote server. The setup() function defines package metadata and a custom install command that executes a network request during installation via the overridden run() method. The repeated requests to an external server during both import and install stages suggest the possibility of remote command-and-control, data exfiltration, or tracking. There are no obfuscation techniques or hardcoded credentials, but the external requests are suspicious and serve no clear benign purpose. The code does not perform malicious actions such as modifying files, executing commands, or network exfiltration beyond the GET request, but the pattern indicates potential malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs external network requests during import and installation without clear legitimate purpose, indicating a high potential for malicious behavior. The repeated contact with an external server, especially with an unusual URL, suggests it could be used for tracking, command-and-control, or data exfiltration. This package should be considered suspicious and potentially malicious.",
