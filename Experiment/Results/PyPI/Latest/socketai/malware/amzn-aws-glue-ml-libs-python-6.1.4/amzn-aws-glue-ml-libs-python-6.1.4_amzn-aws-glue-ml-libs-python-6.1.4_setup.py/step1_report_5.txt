{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation command that performs a GET request to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long_description; it makes an HTTP GET request to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python' within the global scope and inside the post_install() function.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends data to an external server, which could potentially leak system information or be used for tracking. The external URL suggests a remote server interaction during package installation.",
  "flows": "On importing the module, the requests.get() is executed immediately, sending a GET request. During installation, the PostInstallCommand.run() method invokes post_install(), which again makes the same GET request. This creates a source-to-sink flow where external data is requested at import time and during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The GET request to an external server at 'pov.sh:45111' occurs both at the global scope and during the install process, which is unusual and suspicious for a typical package setup. The repeated requests suggest potential tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The URL used is non-standard and could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and sets up a package with custom install behavior. The immediate GET request at the global scope executes upon module load, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. The post_install() function also sends a request during installation, increasing the likelihood of data leakage or malicious monitoring. There are no other suspicious code constructs, but the external call to an untrusted domain is a significant concern. No obfuscation or malicious payloads such as code execution, data theft, or system modification are directly observed beyond the external request. The external request pattern and the external URL are the main concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The package includes a suspicious behavior of making external HTTP requests during both module load and installation to an untrusted server. This pattern could be used for malicious tracking, data exfiltration, or remote control. While no direct malicious payload is present, the external communication is a security concern and suggests potential malicious intent or privacy violations.",
