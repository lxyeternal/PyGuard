{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with a custom post-installation step that performs an HTTP GET request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads the URL string in 'requests.get' calls during module import and within the 'post_install' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' calls send data to an external server, which could potentially be used for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The import of the 'requests' library and execution of 'requests.get' during module import initiate communication with the external server immediately upon import. The 'post_install' function also performs the same request after installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an external network request at import time, which is unusual for a setup script. The URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python' is hardcoded and external. The 'post_install' function makes a request to the same URL during package installation. There is no indication of data being sent; however, the repeated requests to an external server, especially during import, is suspicious. No other malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup configuration for a Python package using 'setuptools'. It imports standard modules and 'requests'. It makes an immediate GET request to an external server upon module import, which is unusual and could be used for tracking or malicious activity. The 'post_install' function also makes a similar request after installation, which might be intended as a backdoor or tracking mechanism. No other malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The URL and repeated network requests are the main suspicious elements. Overall, the code performs external contact during both import and installation phases, which raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary suspicious aspect is its external network communication during module import and post-installation, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. No other malicious behaviors or obfuscation are evident. The package seems to include a hidden or undesirable external contact point, raising security concerns.",
