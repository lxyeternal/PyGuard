{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package with a custom post-installation step that makes an HTTP request to a specific server endpoint.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network via requests.get() at the beginning and inside the post_install() function.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP GET request sends data to an external server, potentially leaking information or signaling to a remote server.",
  "flows": "The initial requests.get() at the start and the request within post_install() send data to http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes an unsolicited network request during import and during post-installation without clear user consent or explicit purpose. The URL is suspicious and may be used for tracking or malicious purposes. The initial request outside of any function executes upon module load, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The code does not handle responses or errors from the requests, which could be used to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file with custom install behavior. The immediate network request upon module import is suspicious, as it connects to an external server without any explicit user action or configuration. The post_install() function also makes a request to the same URL after installation, which could be used for tracking, command-and-control, or data exfiltration. There is no validation, encryption, or user notification about these requests, and no clear legitimate purpose for such network activity is provided. The code does not contain obfuscation or other suspicious language features but demonstrates potentially malicious behavior through unsolicited network communication during package installation and import.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by making unsolicited network requests during import and post-install, potentially for tracking, data exfiltration, or malicious command-and-control. The URL and lack of user awareness strongly suggest malicious intent. It should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
