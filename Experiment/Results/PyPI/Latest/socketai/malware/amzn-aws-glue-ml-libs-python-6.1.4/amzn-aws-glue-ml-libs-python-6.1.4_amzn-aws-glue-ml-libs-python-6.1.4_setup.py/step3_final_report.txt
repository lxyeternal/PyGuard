{
  "purpose": "The code performs a network request to a suspicious external URL during import and again during post-installation, which is unusual for setup scripts and indicates potential malicious tracking or command-and-control activity.",
  "sources": "Immediate GET request at module import; GET request within post_install() function called during installation.",
  "sinks": "External server contact via HTTP GET requests, potentially for data exfiltration, tracking, or command-and-control signaling.",
  "flows": "Requests are made at import time and during package installation, establishing source-to-sink paths for external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Unsolicited external network requests during import and install; hardcoded suspicious URL; no user notification or consent; no error handling for requests.",
  "analysis": "The code makes external HTTP GET requests at import and during installation without user notification, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The URL is external and not documented, raising concerns about tracking or malicious command-and-control. No payloads, obfuscation, or malicious code execution are present, but the repeated contact pattern is a red flag. The straightforward code structure and lack of obfuscation confirm the pattern is deliberate. The repeated external contact during critical setup phases suggests potential malicious intent, such as tracking or C2 communication, despite the absence of payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior through repeated external network requests to a hardcoded, external URL during import and installation. While no malicious payloads are detected, this pattern is indicative of potential malicious activity, such as tracking or command-and-control signaling. The malware risk is moderate to high, and the security risk is significant due to the unsolicited external contact. The code should be flagged for further review and caution.",
