{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom post-install action that makes an HTTP request.",
  "sources": "requests.get call at the top level and within the post_install function.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP request could send or receive data, potentially leaking information if the endpoint is malicious or if the request is manipulated.",
  "flows": "Code execution triggers an HTTP GET request to a remote server both immediately upon module import and during package installation via the post_install method.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional HTTP GET requests are made to an external server ('http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python') at import time and during installation, which is unusual and suspicious as it could be used for tracking or malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and third-party requests library, then performs an immediate GET request to a suspicious URL. It defines a post-installation function that repeats this request, which is executed as part of the custom installation command. No other malicious activities are evident; the primary concern is the unsolicited outbound connection, which could be used for tracking, command-and-control, or data exfiltration. The package setup and configuration appear standard apart from the remote requests, which are performed without any apparent purpose or user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by making unsolicited outbound HTTP requests during import and installation, which could be used for malicious tracking or data collection. There is no evidence of payload delivery or system compromise, but the repeated contact with an external server is concerning and warrants caution.",
