      "conclusion": "The package executes arbitrary code during installation, representing a significant security risk. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main()', the pattern itself is dangerous and commonly exploited in malicious packages. The overall malware score should be high (~0.75-0.8), and the security risk similarly elevated (~0.8). The code is not obfuscated, but the behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious. Caution is strongly advised before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of data exfiltration to malicious or suspicious domains. While it does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation, its covert data transmission indicates malicious intent. The current scores should reflect high suspicion but acknowledge the absence of payloads. The malware score should be adjusted to approximately 0.75, the security risk to around 0.85, and obfuscation remains at 0."
