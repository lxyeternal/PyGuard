{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'neursts' with custom installation behavior that executes a main function after installation.",
  "sources": "The 'run' method in the 'CrazyInstallStrat' class, which imports and calls 'main' from 'main' module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' from 'main' module, which could execute arbitrary code if 'main' contains malicious instructions.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom 'run' method executes 'main()' from 'main' module after installation completes.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes arbitrary code ('main()') post-installation without any security checks or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for the 'neursts' package. It includes a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method. After completing the standard installation process, it imports and calls 'main()' from a local module 'main'. This behavior is unusual because executing arbitrary code during installation can be malicious, especially if 'main' contains harmful instructions. There is no validation, condition, or security measure around the 'main()' invocation. The code also depends on standard packages like 'requests' and 'psutil', which are not suspicious by themselves. However, the post-install execution of an external function poses a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical package setup but includes a potentially malicious behavior by executing 'main()' during installation without any validation. This could be exploited to run arbitrary code on the target system, indicating a high risk. The package could be used to deliver malicious payloads during installation.",
