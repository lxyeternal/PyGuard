{
  "purpose": "This setup script defines package installation configuration for the 'neursts' Python package, including a custom install command that executes additional code post-installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata from setup parameters and imports the 'main' function from a local 'main' module during installation.",
  "sinks": "The 'main' function from the local 'main' module is invoked during the install process, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious.",
  "flows": "The installation process triggers the custom 'run' method, which calls 'main()' from 'main' module, executing whatever code is inside that function.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' runs code ('main()') during the installation phase, which is uncommon and could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools functions and defines a custom install class that executes 'main()' from a local module during installation. The 'setup' function specifies package metadata and dependencies, which appear normal. However, executing 'main()' unconditionally at install time is suspicious, as it could run malicious code embedded in the 'main' module without user consent. There are no other suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. The main concern is the automatic invocation of potentially arbitrary code during installation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be a standard setup script, but the invocation of 'main()' during installation is suspicious and could be malicious if the 'main' module contains harmful code. The overall risk depends heavily on the contents of 'main'.",
