  "conclusion": "The package executes arbitrary code during installation, representing a significant security risk. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main()', the pattern itself is dangerous and commonly exploited in malicious packages. The overall malware score should be high (~0.75-0.8), and the security risk similarly elevated (~0.8). The code is not obfuscated, but the behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious. Caution is strongly advised before trusting or deploying this package."
