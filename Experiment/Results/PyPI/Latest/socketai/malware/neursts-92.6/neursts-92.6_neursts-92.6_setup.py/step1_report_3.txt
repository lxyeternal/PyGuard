  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom installation step that executes code from main.py after installation.",
  "sources": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' imports and runs main() from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "Executing main() during installation could execute arbitrary code from main.py, which is a potential security risk.",
  "flows": "During setup, the install process triggers CrazyInstallStrat.run(), which calls main() from main.py.",
  "anomalies": "Running a Python function from an imported module during package installation is unusual and potentially dangerous; no validation or sandboxing is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration with a custom installation class that overrides the run() method. This method imports and executes main() from main.py during installation, which could run arbitrary code at install time. The setup requires 'requests' and 'psutil', but these are common libraries. The main concern is the execution of external code during setup without validation, which can be exploited if main.py contains malicious code. No obfuscated code or hidden payloads are present. Overall, the code introduces a potential attack vector by executing arbitrary code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes code from main.py during installation, which poses a security risk if main.py contains malicious or unintended code. This behavior is suspicious and should be reviewed before use.",
