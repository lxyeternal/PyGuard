{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and sends this data encoded in base64 via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "The code reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), MAC addresses via subprocess calls, and encodes MAC addresses with base64.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs URLs with the collected data and makes HTTP requests using urllib.request.urlopen, sending data to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are gathered as sources, encoded, and then sent via GET requests to external URLs as parameters, possibly leaking sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs are suspicious and appear to be non-standard or malicious domains; the use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses may obscure data exfiltration; no validation or sanitization of data before transmission; no user consent or logging.",
  "analysis": "The code collects host-specific information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. The MAC addresses are obtained through system-specific commands, which is standard. The data is then base64 encoded, potentially to conceal the content. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends the data via GET requests without encryption or authentication. The external URLs do not appear legitimate and could be used for malicious data exfiltration. There is no evidence of malicious payload execution or backdoors; however, the behavior of silently sending system info to external servers is concerning, especially given the suspicious domains involved. The code does not perform any harmful actions directly but facilitates covert data transmission, which can be malicious depending on context.",
  "conclusion": "The script secretly gathers and transmits system information to suspicious external servers, which poses a security risk. The code could be used for tracking or data exfiltration without user consent, indicating malicious intent. No obfuscation or malware code is evident, but its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
