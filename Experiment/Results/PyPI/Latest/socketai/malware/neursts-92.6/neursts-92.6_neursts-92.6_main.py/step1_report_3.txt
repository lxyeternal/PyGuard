{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send it to specified remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading system network info), base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and urllib.request.urlopen for network requests.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sends data to external URLs with constructed parameters, potentially leaking collected data.",
  "flows": "Source functions (platform.node, getpass.getuser, os.getcwd, get_mac_addresses) gather data -> data is base64-encoded -> parameters are included in URL -> urlopen() transmits data to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs, including suspicious domains; encoding MAC addresses before transmission; no validation or authentication of the data transmission; silent exception handling; code is designed to send system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, encoding MAC addresses in base64 before including them as URL parameters. It then constructs URLs with this data and sends requests without any validation, authentication, or user notification. The external URLs are suspicious and could be used for data exfiltration or tracking. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors, potentially hiding failures. No signs of obfuscation or encrypted payloads, but the data collection and transmission are suspicious, especially given the obscure domains.",
  "conclusion": "The code gathers system info, encodes MAC addresses, and transmits this data to external, suspicious URLs without user consent. This behavior is indicative of potential data exfiltration or tracking. No malicious code like system damage or backdoors is present, but the purpose of data collection and transmission without consent raises security concerns.",
