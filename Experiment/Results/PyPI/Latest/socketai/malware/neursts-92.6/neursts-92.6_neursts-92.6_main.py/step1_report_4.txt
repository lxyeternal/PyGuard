  "purpose": "Collect system information (host name, user, current directory, MAC addresses), encode MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname, getpass.getuser() for username, os.getcwd() for current directory, get_mac_addresses() for MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() for sending data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Collects system info, encodes MAC addresses, constructs URLs with query parameters, then sends data to remote servers via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious, resembling potentially malicious or maliciously-controlled domains. No user input is used; all data is system-generated. The code encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, which could be used to evade simple detection. The code does not handle responses, indicating data exfiltration intent rather than functional communication.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. The MAC addresses are base64-encoded, possibly to obfuscate data. The code then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends the collected data via HTTP GET requests without validation or response handling. The code lacks any form of user consent, logging, or explicit purpose description. The external URLs are unusual and may be malicious command-and-control servers or data exfiltration points. No input from external sources is processed, reducing the chance of injection vulnerabilities, but the data collection and transmission behavior indicate potential malicious intent related to system reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to collect detailed system information and transmit it to potentially malicious external servers, which could be used for reconnaissance or data theft. The suspicious domain names and the absence of user notification or consent strongly suggest malicious intent. The overall risk is high, and this package should be treated as potentially harmful.",
