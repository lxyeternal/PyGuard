  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'pnuske', defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, call to setup() with package information and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of the 'pnuske:run' entry point when installed and invoked.",
  "flows": "The setup script itself does not execute or invoke 'pnuske:run'; it only declares it as an entry point. Actual execution occurs when the user runs the 'pnuske' command after installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The script is a standard setup configuration. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated parts present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools to package a project. It specifies the package name, version, and automatically finds packages. It declares a console script entry point 'pnuske' mapped to 'pnuske:run'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity within this script. The entry point depends on the actual 'pnuske' module, which is not provided here; thus, potential maliciousness or vulnerabilities in that module cannot be assessed. As this script is standard and straightforward, it does not contain obfuscation or malware. No anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with a console entry point. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues within this code fragment.",
