{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pnuske' Python package, defining package metadata, finding packages, and creating a console script entry point.",
  "sources": "import statement from setuptools, package name, version, packages via find_packages(), entry_points with console_scripts",
  "sinks": "Execution of the 'pnuske:run' entry point, which could invoke code from the 'pnuske' module when the command is run",
  "flows": "Setup defines metadata; upon installation, the console script 'pnuske' executes 'pnuske:run', potentially executing arbitrary code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures present; straightforward setup configuration",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions, specifies package name and version, dynamically finds packages, and sets up a console script entry point. The entry point 'pnuske=pnuske:run' suggests that executing 'pnuske' will run the 'run' function in the 'pnuske' module. No code execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is evident. The script serves as a typical package setup for distribution and does not contain embedded malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code for distributing a Python package named 'pnuske'.",
