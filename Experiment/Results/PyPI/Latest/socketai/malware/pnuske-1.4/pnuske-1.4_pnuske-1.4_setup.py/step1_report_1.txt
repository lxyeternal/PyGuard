{
  "purpose": "Configure the packaging and installation of the 'pnuske' Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata, package list via find_packages(), and entry point for console script 'pnuske'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The setup process uses package discovery and defines an entry point, but no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated behavior detected. The code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "This is a typical Python setup script using setuptools. It imports setup and find_packages, then calls setup() with package metadata, package discovery, and defines a console script entry point. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears clean and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves to install and expose a command-line interface for the 'pnuske' package.",
