  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'pnuske' Python project, defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions and uses 'find_packages()' and defines 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; standard packaging setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for Python packaging. It imports 'setuptools' functions, defines package name and version, automatically discovers packages, and sets up a console script entry point. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to serve its intended purpose for packaging and installation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script used for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
