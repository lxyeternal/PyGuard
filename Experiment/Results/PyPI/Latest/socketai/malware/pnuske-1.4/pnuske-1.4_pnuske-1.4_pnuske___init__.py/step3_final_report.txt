{
  "purpose": "This code imports the 'run' function from a local 'main' module, likely to execute or invoke functionality defined elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data directly.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the import statement does not involve data transfer or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, which is standard in Python projects. It does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of code execution, network activity, or data handling. The minimal structure and clarity support a high confidence in its safety. Given the lack of context about the 'main' module, the assessment assumes the module is not malicious; if it were, the risk could be higher, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
