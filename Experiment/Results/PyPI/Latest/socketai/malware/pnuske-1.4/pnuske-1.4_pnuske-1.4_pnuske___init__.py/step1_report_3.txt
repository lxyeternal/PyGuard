{
  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'run' from a local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, which may read or execute code within 'main'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no data or untrusted input is handled or outputted.",
  "flows": "None explicitly shown; if 'run' is invoked elsewhere, it could be a sink, but not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a single import statement from a local module. It does not perform any input handling, data processing, or network activity. Without additional context, it is a simple import which by itself is benign. The absence of complex logic, code execution, or data leaks indicates low likelihood of malicious behavior. Since only this line is provided, it is impossible to determine if 'main' contains malicious code, but based solely on this import, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign, assuming 'main' is a legitimate module. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected.",
