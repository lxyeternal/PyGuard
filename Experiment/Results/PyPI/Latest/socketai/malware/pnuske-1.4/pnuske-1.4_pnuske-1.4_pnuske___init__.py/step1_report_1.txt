{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'run' function from a local module named 'main', likely intended to execute a primary process or application entry point.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement which reads the 'main' module and the 'run' function within it.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system calls in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow analysis is minimal; the code only imports a function and does not invoke or execute it.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, consisting of only an import statement. No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet simply imports a function from a relative module, likely to be called elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. Its simplicity and standard structure do not indicate malicious intent. The context of usage might matter, but within this fragment, there is no malicious or security-related concern.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious elements.",
