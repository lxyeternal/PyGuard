  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are explicitly present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable with this limited code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no suspicious or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a function 'run' from a sibling module 'main'. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code by itself appears benign and typical of modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a setup for further execution, which is not shown here.",
