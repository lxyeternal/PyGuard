{
  "purpose": "To define a setup script for a Python package that includes a custom installation process which sends system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends collected data to a remote IP address, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), then transmitted via requests.get to a remote IP.",
  "anomalies": "The code exfiltrates system information to an external IP during installation without user consent, which is suspicious. The IP address appears hardcoded and unusual. The comment 'Dependency Confusion POC' suggests awareness of supply chain tactics. No user input validation is present.",
  "analysis": "The script extends setuptools installation process to include a network request that transmits hostname, current directory, and username to a specific IP address. This behavior is typical of data exfiltration or malicious tracking. No other suspicious code, such as code injection or backdoors, is present. The use of requests to send system info during installation is malicious intent. The IP address is hardcoded, indicating possible command-and-control or data collection. No other malicious functions or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data exfiltration of system information during package installation, indicating malicious or suspicious behavior. It could be used for unauthorized surveillance or targeted attacks, constituting a security threat.",
