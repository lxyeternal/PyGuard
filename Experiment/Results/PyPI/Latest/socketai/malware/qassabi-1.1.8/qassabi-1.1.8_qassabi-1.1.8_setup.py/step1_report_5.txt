{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username; it also imports modules requests, socket, getpass, os.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get call sends data to a remote IP address (192.198.82.14:3000/log), which could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code collects hostname, cwd, and username (sources) and sends them via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a setup script to send data to a hardcoded IP address during installation, which is suspicious. The IP address and the data sent could be used for tracking or malicious data collection. The code is simple, but the behavior during install is potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a custom install command that, when run, gathers system info (hostname, current directory, username). It then makes an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address with these details as parameters. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking during package installation. The presence of this network activity solely during installation, combined with the hardcoded IP, is suspicious and typical of malicious activity or supply chain attacks. No other malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated sections are present. The code appears designed to silently send system info to an external server.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate package setup tasks but includes suspicious behavior by exfiltrating system info to a remote server during installation, indicating malicious intent. The overall security risk is high due to data exfiltration behavior.",
