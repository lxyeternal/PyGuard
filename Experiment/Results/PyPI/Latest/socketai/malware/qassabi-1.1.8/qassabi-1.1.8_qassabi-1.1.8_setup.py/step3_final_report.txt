{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) during installation and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address, indicating malicious data exfiltration activity during package setup.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to http://192.198.82.14:3000/log",
  "flows": "System info variables → requests.get() to external IP",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during installation without user consent, hardcoded suspicious IP, no obfuscation or user prompts",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during package installation, gathers hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address. This behavior is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity, as it exfiltrates user system info covertly. The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, and the data flow is direct from system info sources to network sink. The activity aligns with supply chain attack patterns or covert surveillance. The scores assigned in the reports vary, but given the activity, a high malware score (>=0.8) and security risk score (~0.9) are justified. The code's behavior warrants high concern, and the activity should be considered malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation, with high confidence. The activity is serious, justifying a malware score of approximately 0.9 and a security risk score of 0.9. The code should be treated as highly malicious, and its use is strongly discouraged.",
