{
  "purpose": "Defines a Python package setup process with a custom install command that collects system information and sends it to a specified remote server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser(), requests.get() with system info as parameters",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call to a remote server with system information as URL parameters",
  "flows": "System information gathered from hostname, current directory, and username flows into an HTTP GET request sent to a remote IP address",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects system info and exfiltrates it to an IP address during installation, which is unusual behavior for a package setup script. The IP address appears suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation command that executes during package installation. It collects sensitive system data such as hostname, current directory, and username, then transmits this data to a remote server via an HTTP GET request. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or reconnaissance, typical of supply chain attacks or malicious modules. No other malicious code or backdoors are evident beyond this network activity. The purpose seems to be covert data collection, which raises significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information during package installation to a remote server. This indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, making the package potentially dangerous for use. The activity suggests a supply chain compromise or malicious purpose.",
