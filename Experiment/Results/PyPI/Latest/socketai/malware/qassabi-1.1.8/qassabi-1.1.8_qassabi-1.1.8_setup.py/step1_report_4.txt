{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup script that customizes the installation process to send system information to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Code reads system information including hostname, current working directory, and username using socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), and getpass.getuser().",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends data to a remote server at 'http://192.198.82.14:3000/log', transmitting collected system data.",
  "flows": "System info obtained from sources (hostname, cwd, username) flows into the requests.get() call as URL parameters, transmitting data to the remote server during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code conducts data exfiltration during the installation process without user consent. No other unusual code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the installation process of a Python package via a custom 'install' command. During installation, it collects system info (hostname, current directory, username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote server. This behavior resembles data exfiltration without user approval, which can be considered malicious or suspicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden backdoors. The use of 'requests' to send system info to an external server during setup is potentially malicious, especially if the server is unknown or unauthorized. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or other typical security issues but performs malicious activity in the context of supply chain security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is potentially malicious as it exfiltrates system information during package installation without user consent, indicating malicious intent. This behavior warrants suspicion and further review before use.",
