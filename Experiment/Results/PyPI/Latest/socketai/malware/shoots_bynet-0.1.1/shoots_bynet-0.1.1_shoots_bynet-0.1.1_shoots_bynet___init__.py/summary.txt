  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious practices like URL obfuscation and insecure SSL but does not contain explicit malicious payloads or actions. Its behavior could be exploited if the endpoint is malicious, but in isolation, it appears benign. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to insecure practices, with a low malware likelihood."
