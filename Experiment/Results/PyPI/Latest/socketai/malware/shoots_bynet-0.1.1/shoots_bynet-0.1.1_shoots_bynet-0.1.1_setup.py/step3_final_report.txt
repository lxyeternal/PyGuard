  "purpose": "Define package metadata and CLI entry point for the 'shoots-bynet' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields; find_packages() for package discovery; entry_points for CLI command mapping.",
  "sinks": "The CLI command 'shoots-bynet' invokes the function 'shoots_bynet:shoots_bynet' in the package; no external data sources or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "During package installation, metadata is read; upon CLI invocation, the 'shoots_bynet' function is executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and follows standard packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py script is a typical static configuration file for packaging a Python project. It does not include dynamic code, external data reading, or obfuscated elements. The entry point maps a CLI command to a function within the package, which is standard practice. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with this benign assessment. The only potential concern is the implementation of 'shoots_bynet:shoots_bynet', which is outside the scope of this script; however, the setup script itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are justified and should remain as-is. Further security assessment would require inspecting the actual implementation of the 'shoots_bynet' function, but based solely on this setup script, it is safe.",
