{
  "purpose": "Define and set up a Python package named 'shoots-bynet' with specified metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input sources or external data reads; standard setup script).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data leaks, network connections, or sensitive data handling).",
  "flows": "N/A (no untrusted data flows present).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard setuptools package setup conventions. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and uses it to configure package metadata and entry points. The package name, author, email, and version are straightforward. The entry point creates a console script 'shoots-bynet' mapped to a function 'shoots_bynet' in the 'shoots_bynet' module, which is a common pattern for CLI tools. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a normal, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely defines package metadata and a CLI entry point.",
