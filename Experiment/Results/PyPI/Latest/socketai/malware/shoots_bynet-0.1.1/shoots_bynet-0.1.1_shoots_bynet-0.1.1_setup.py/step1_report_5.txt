  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package named 'shoots-bynet' for distribution, including metadata and console script entry point.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code primarily reads its own static configuration and package files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or data output points.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears to be standard setup configuration with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard setuptools functions to define a Python package. It specifies package metadata, finds packages automatically, and sets up a console script entry point. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated constructs. The author and email are provided, but they are not inherently suspicious. No external data sources or sink functions are present. The script is typical for packaging Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for packaging a Python project. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
