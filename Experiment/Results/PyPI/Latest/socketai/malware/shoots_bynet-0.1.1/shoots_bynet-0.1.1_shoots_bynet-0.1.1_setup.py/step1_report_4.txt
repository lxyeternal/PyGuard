{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'shoots-bynet', including metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and packages; the entry_points dictionary defining the console script.",
  "sinks": "The 'console_scripts' entry point which, when installed, creates a command-line executable that invokes 'shoots_bynet:shoots_bynet'.",
  "flows": "Installation process reads package metadata, and executing 'shoots-bynet' runs the 'shoots_bynet' function from the 'shoots_bynet' module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard setup script with normal metadata and entry points.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with package metadata and a console script entry point. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The entry point suggests the existence of a module 'shoots_bynet' with a function 'shoots_bynet', which is standard for Python CLI tools. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive operations are evident in this configuration. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py code appears benign and standard for Python package distribution. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected based on this code alone.",
