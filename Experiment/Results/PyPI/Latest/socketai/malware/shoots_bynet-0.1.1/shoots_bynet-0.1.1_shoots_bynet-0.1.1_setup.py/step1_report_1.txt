{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'shoots-bynet', including metadata and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads static package metadata such as name, version, author, email, description, and package discovery information.",
  "targets": "Potential untrusted data inputs are not present; the script does not read user input or environment variables.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only executes static configuration functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The setup configuration appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' functions to define package setup parameters, including package discovery and console script entry points. All values are hardcoded and static. No dynamic execution, external data reading, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The package's purpose is clearly to configure distribution; there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard, benign package configuration file.",
