  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are justified and should remain as-is. Further security assessment would require inspecting the actual implementation of the 'shoots_bynet' function, but based solely on this setup script, it is safe."
