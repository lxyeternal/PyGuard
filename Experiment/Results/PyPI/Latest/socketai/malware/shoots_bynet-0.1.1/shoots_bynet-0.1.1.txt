      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are justified and should remain as-is. Further security assessment would require inspecting the actual implementation of the 'shoots_bynet' function, but based solely on this setup script, it is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious practices like URL obfuscation and insecure SSL but does not contain explicit malicious payloads or actions. Its behavior could be exploited if the endpoint is malicious, but in isolation, it appears benign. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to insecure practices, with a low malware likelihood."
