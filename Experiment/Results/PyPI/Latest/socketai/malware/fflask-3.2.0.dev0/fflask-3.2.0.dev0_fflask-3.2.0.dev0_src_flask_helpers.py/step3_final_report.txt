{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for Flask applications, including response creation, URL generation, redirection, flashing messages, and file serving.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., FLASK_DEBUG, FLASK_SKIP_DOTENV), request context, session data, template modules, file paths, request environment.",
  "sinks": "Response objects, environment variables, file system paths, URL endpoints, session storage, request environment.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence configuration; request/session data flow into response handling; file paths and request data used in file serving functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected. Use of environment variables and standard Flask practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Flask utility functions for response handling, URL building, redirection, flashing messages, and file serving. It interacts with environment variables for configuration, manages request and session data securely, and uses well-established Flask and Werkzeug APIs. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The code's structure and usage align with typical Flask application practices, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Flask utility module with no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs best practices for environment configuration, request handling, and file serving, with no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
