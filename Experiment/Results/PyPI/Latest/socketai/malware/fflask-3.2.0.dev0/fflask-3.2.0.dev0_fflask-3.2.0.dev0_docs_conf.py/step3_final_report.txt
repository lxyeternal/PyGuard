  "purpose": "Configure Sphinx documentation for the Flask project, including custom URL linking based on version info.",
  "sources": "Version info from get_version('Flask') and user input in github_link function.",
  "sinks": "Reference nodes created for documentation; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Version info flows into URL construction in github_link, which then creates reference nodes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; URL generation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script with a custom role for linking to GitHub. It constructs URLs dynamically based on the project version, which is a common pattern. No external data is fetched or sent, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The URL construction logic is safe, relying on controlled internal version data. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are justified given the benign nature of the code. The slight risk score (0.1) accounts for dynamic URL generation but does not indicate real vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration with a custom role for linking to GitHub. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The low scores are appropriate and justified. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
