{
  "purpose": "Defines a Blueprint class extending SansioBlueprint for Flask application modularity, with methods for static file handling, resource opening, and cache control.",
  "sources": "Configuration data from current_app.config, input parameters to class methods (filename, resource, mode).",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function, open() calls on file paths.",
  "flows": "Configuration values and input parameters flow into methods, which may influence file serving or resource opening behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code appears to be a standard Flask/Blueprint extension with typical methods for static file serving and resource access.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a Blueprint class for Flask, managing static files and resources. It retrieves configuration for cache control, serves static files via send_from_directory, and opens resources with proper validation. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are evident, nor are there suspicious code patterns, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. The only potential concern is the open() calls, but they are constrained to specific modes and are part of normal file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask Blueprint extension with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It functions to serve static files and open resources securely, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
