{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Flask Blueprint class with methods for static file serving and resource access, integrated with app configuration and CLI extensions.",
  "sources": "current_app.config['SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT'], self.static_folder, resource parameter in open_resource",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function, open() calls for reading resources",
  "flows": "Configuration values -> get_send_file_max_age method -> send_from_directory; resource path -> open_resource method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of open() for reading files is standard. No network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles static file serving, resource management, and CLI integration within a Flask-like framework. It uses configuration values safely, with proper validation of resource modes. No data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscated sections are present. The only external interaction involves reading files from disk and serving static content, which are standard operations. The code appears to be well-structured, with no anomalies indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Flask blueprint extension with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs legitimate functions related to static file handling and resource management without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
