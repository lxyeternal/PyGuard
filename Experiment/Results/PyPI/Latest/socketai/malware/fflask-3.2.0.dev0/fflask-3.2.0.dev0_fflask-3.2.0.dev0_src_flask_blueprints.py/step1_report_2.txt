{
  "purpose": "Define a custom Flask-like Blueprint class with methods for static file serving, resource opening, and cache control.",
  "sources": "Configuration access (current_app.config), class instantiation parameters, method parameters (filename, resource, mode), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "send_from_directory function (serving static files), open() function (reading files from disk).",
  "flows": "Configuration values (SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT) influence cache headers; filename parameter flows into send_from_directory; resource parameter flows into open(), mode controls file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual constructs; no external network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class extending a blueprint structure for a web application, providing static file serving, resource opening, and cache control features. It accesses configuration values securely, uses standard file operations, and does not include any network operations, external data transmission, or malicious logic. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code is structured normally with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a web application blueprint with no malicious or maliciously intended features. It operates within expected parameters for static file serving and resource management, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
