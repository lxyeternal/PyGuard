{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and type aliases for Flask or Werkzeug web framework, defining expected response and callback types.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines type variables, unions, and callables related to web request handling.",
  "targets": "No explicit data sinks; focus on potential flow points such as callback functions and response types.",
  "flows": "Type annotations describe expected data flows, mainly for static type checking; no runtime data flow analysis possible from static code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for type hinting and static analysis support, importing standard typing modules and defining type aliases. No code execution, data manipulation, or external communication logic is present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No data sources or sinks are actively used at runtime; it's purely declarative.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation module for a Flask/Werkzeug application, providing type hints for request and response handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a safe, purely static, type declaration file.",
