{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and type aliases for use in a web application framework, specifically for handling HTTP responses, request lifecycle hooks, and callback functions.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and class imports at the beginning of the file, including 'typing', '__future__' import, and conditional imports for type checking.",
  "sinks": "Type annotations themselves do not serve as sinks; they only specify expected data types. No runtime data processing or I/O is present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data handling logic; the code solely establishes type definitions for annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code uses standard type annotation syntax and conditional type-checking imports, which are typical for type hinting in Python.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type alias definitions and import statements meant for static type checking. It imports modules securely, uses type variables, and defines unions of types related to HTTP responses and application callbacks. No input/output operations, network calls, or data processing are present. The code is straightforward and aligns with best practices for static type hinting in Python web frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type annotations and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process or handle untrusted data at runtime, nor does it include any suspicious or malicious constructs. The code appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
