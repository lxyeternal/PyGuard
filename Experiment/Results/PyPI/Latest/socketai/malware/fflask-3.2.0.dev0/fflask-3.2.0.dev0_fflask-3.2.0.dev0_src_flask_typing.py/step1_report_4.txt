{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and import declarations for a web framework, defining various response types, callables, and data structures used in HTTP handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard and third-party libraries, type annotations, and variable definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing, I/O, or network operations are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines types and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type annotations, union type definitions, and import statements used for static type checking in a web framework context. No runtime logic, data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The module serves as a type hinting and interface specification file, which poses no direct security threat or malicious behavior. No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified in the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type definition module for a web framework, containing no executable logic, data processing, or network operations that could be malicious. It appears to be a legitimate, standard type annotations setup with no security concerns.",
