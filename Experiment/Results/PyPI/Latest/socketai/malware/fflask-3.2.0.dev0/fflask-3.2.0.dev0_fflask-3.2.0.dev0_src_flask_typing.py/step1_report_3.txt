  "purpose": "Define type aliases and callables for a Flask/werkzeug web application, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, only defines types and imports modules conditionally for type hints.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code solely establishes type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, conditionally includes type hints, and defines several type aliases for request and response handling in a web application context. It uses standard practices for type annotations, union types, and generic type variables. No external data processing, no network operations, or code execution is present. The code appears to be purely for type hinting and structural clarity, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard type definition module for a Flask-like web application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended solely for type annotation purposes.",
