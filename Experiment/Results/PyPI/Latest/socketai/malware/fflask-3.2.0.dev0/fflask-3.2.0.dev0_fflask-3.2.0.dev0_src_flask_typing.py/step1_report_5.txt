  "purpose": "Define type aliases and callables for use in a web framework, specifically Flask or Werkzeug, to specify expected data types for responses, headers, and various request/response lifecycle hooks.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations and imports from standard library and third-party modules, but does not read external data sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present where untrusted data is written or causes side effects such as network transmission, file modification, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The code primarily establishes type definitions and does not implement data flow logic. No data flows from sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code strictly defines type annotations and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type alias definitions and type variables for a web framework, using standard typing practices. It imports from well-known modules, with no external data inputs, outputs, or side effects. No obfuscation, malicious code, or risky behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for type hinting and interface specification within a web framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware.",
