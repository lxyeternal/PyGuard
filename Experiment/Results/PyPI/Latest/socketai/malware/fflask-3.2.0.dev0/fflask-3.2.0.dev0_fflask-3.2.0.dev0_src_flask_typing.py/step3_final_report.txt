  "purpose": "Define type aliases, unions, and callables for static type checking in Flask/Werkzeug web applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, typing module, and conditional imports for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains only type annotations and no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows or untrusted data processing occur.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward type alias definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for static type annotations, importing standard modules, defining unions, type variables, and callable signatures relevant to Flask/Werkzeug. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network I/O, or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is to facilitate static type checking, and all patterns are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static type declaration module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
