  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is solely for static type annotations related to Flask/Werkzeug.\n- No data processing, network I/O, or runtime logic is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code imports standard modules and uses typical type hinting practices.\n- The purpose is to facilitate static type checking, not runtime behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any data sinks or sources that could be exploited.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The type annotations and unions are straightforward and consistent.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues with the logic, reasoning, or implementation.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are made in the reports.\n- The code is a standard, well-structured type annotation module.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 is appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is appropriate, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.0 is justified, given the purely static, annotation-only nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, with no security risks or malware indications.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** This code is a standard static type declaration module with no security concerns.",
