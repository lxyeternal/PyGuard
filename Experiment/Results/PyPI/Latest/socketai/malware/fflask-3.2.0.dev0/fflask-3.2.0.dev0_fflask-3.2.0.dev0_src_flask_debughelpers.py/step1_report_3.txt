{
  "purpose": "The code provides various utility functions, custom exceptions, and debugging aids for a web application framework, primarily related to request handling, template loading, and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Request objects, request.form, request.files, loader.__dict__, app.logger, attempts list containing loader, srcobj, and triple",
  "sinks": "Exception raising (DebugFilesKeyError, FormDataRoutingRedirect), modifying request.files.__class__, app.logger.info",
  "flows": "Request data (form, files) -> error handling or exception raising; loader info and template attempts -> logging; request context and blueprint info -> logging",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, no suspicious modifications or hidden backdoors. Patch to request.files.__class__ is a standard pattern for error reporting, not malicious. Debugging and logging are for diagnostic purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard utility functions and exception classes intended to improve debugging, error reporting, and developer understanding of internal processes within a Flask-like web framework. No signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The functions modify request object behavior solely for error handling, which is common in web frameworks. The template loading function provides detailed logging info to assist developers. All parts serve legitimate debugging and error handling purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of debugging and utility functions aimed at improving developer insight and error reporting in a web framework. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is standard for framework support and debugging purposes.",
