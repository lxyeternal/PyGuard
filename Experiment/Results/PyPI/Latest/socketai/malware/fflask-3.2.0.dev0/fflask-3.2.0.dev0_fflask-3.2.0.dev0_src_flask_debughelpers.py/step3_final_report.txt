{
  "purpose": "Provides debugging utilities, custom exception classes, and request patching functions for error handling and template loading diagnostics within a web framework.",
  "sources": "Request object attributes (request.form, request.files, request.mimetype, request.url, request.base_url), loader instances, app logger.",
  "sinks": "Custom exceptions raised for debugging, class patching of request.files.__class__, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data from request attributes flow into exception messages and patched classes; loader info flows into logs for diagnostics.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious patterns; patching request.files.__class__ is a debugging aid, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions and exception classes aimed at improving error reporting and debugging in a web application context. It patches request.files to provide more descriptive errors during development, and logs detailed loader attempts. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The patching is a common debugging pattern, and the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, intended for debugging and error diagnostics, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and risk approximately 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
