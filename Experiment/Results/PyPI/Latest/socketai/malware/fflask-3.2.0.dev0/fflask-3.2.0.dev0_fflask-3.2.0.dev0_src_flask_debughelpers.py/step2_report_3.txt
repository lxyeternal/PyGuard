  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the presence of issues, their severity, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides debugging utilities, custom exceptions, and patches for request file handling, with no malicious intent. It enhances error reporting during development.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, as it's mainly debugging utilities.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is accurate. The patching of `request.files.__class__` is a known debugging pattern, not malicious. The detailed error messages improve developer experience.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on error handling, debugging, and loader info logging. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — still very low, as it's debugging-focused.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose. No suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions and exception classes for debugging and template loading, with detailed logging.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — negligible security risk, as it's debugging and logging.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard for debugging purposes, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports—error handling, request patching, and template debugging.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk, just debugging utilities.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are typical debugging aids.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—utilities for debugging, error reporting, and template loader info.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal security concern.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard debugging support.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) across reports, which is reasonable given the debugging nature but still very low.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — extremely low, as all functions serve debugging and error handling, with no security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent, and the scores appropriately reflect the benign, debugging-oriented nature of the code. No further adjustments are necessary.",
