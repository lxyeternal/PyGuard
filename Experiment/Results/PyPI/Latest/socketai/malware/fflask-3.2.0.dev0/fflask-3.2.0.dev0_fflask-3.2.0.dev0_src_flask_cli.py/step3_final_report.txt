  "purpose": "CLI utilities for Flask app management (run server, shell, routes), including dynamic app discovery, environment variable loading, SSL context handling, and plugin command support.",
  "sources": "User inputs for module paths, app names, SSL certs; environment variables; command-line arguments; dynamic module imports via import_string; environment files via dotenv.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic module import (import_string), environment variable setting (os.environ), network server startup (run_simple), SSL context loading, command execution.",
  "flows": "User inputs influence module import paths and expressions, environment variable loading, app instantiation, and server execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of import_string and ast.literal_eval introduces potential risks if inputs are untrusted, but safeguards are employed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs controlled dynamic import and literal evaluation with validation, standard CLI patterns, and environment management. No malicious code, network abuse, or sabotage is evident. Risks are limited to potential misuse if untrusted input is supplied, but safeguards like literal_eval and import validation mitigate this. The code is clear, well-structured, and employs best practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented CLI utility for Flask applications with minimal inherent security risks. No malicious activity or sabotage is detected. The potential for misuse exists if inputs are malicious, but the safeguards are appropriate. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low risk.",
