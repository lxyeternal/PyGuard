  "purpose": "The code provides CLI utilities for managing Flask applications, including commands for running a development server, opening a shell, and listing routes. It handles dynamic importing of modules and loading environment variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (load_dotenv), command-line arguments (via click options), module import paths, and function parameters. It also evaluates string expressions for app lookup and loads plugin entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include dynamic import of modules (import_string), execution of evaluated strings (ast.literal_eval), and executing user-provided expressions in evaluate (eval). Environment variables are set in os.environ, and the code loads environment variables from files.",
  "flows": "Sources such as command-line arguments and environment variable files flow into module imports, string evaluations, and environment settings. These inputs can influence module loading, application selection, and environment configuration. Sinks include dynamic imports, environment variable setting, and expression evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious malicious code such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system access is detected. Use of eval on startup scripts is limited to controlled environment variable files. The dynamic import via import_string could be risky if given malicious string inputs, but in typical usage, it relies on trusted user input for Flask app loading.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports modules based on user input or configuration, evaluates string expressions for app lookup, and loads environment variables from files. While these features are flexible, they can be exploited if malicious strings are provided as input. The eval of startup scripts is controlled via environment variables. No hardcoded credentials, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious file operations are present. No backdoors or cryptomining activity is evident. The use of import_string and eval could be risky if user-controlled input is not sanitized, but in typical use cases, the inputs are controlled by the user deploying the application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a CLI utility for Flask application management, with controlled dynamic imports and environment variable loading. No malicious intent or sabotage is detected. The main security concern is the reliance on user-provided strings for module import and evaluation, which is standard for such tools but could be risky if misused. Overall, the package appears safe in typical usage, with low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
