  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code only performs import statements with no data flows, no external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Code match:** The code is purely import statements from internal modules, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions.\n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk scores:** The report assigns malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, which is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The reasoning is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is standard import statements, no untrusted data, no malicious behavior.\n- **Code match:** The code is straightforward imports from internal modules.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns. The detailed reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard imports, no external data or suspicious activity.\n- **Code match:** The code is just internal imports.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence (0.9), noting the code is just imports, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n- **Observation:** The securityRisk is set to 0.1, perhaps due to a cautious stance, but the reasoning indicates no actual risk.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is purely import statements with no external data handling, the risk score should be 0 or very close to it. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscated remains 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score of 0.1 seems slightly high; I would suggest lowering it to 0, aligning with the reasoning.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others—standard imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n- **Observation:** Similar to Report 4, the risk score is marginally above zero despite no evidence.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score should be 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely import statements with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The only point of contention is the small non-zero security risk scores in reports 4 and 5, which should be lowered to 0, given the absence of any risk factors.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — correct.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0 for all reports, as the code is benign and contains no vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reasoning that the code is a standard, benign module import setup for a web framework, with no malicious or risky elements present.",
