  "purpose": "Import statements for core components of a web framework, likely Flask or similar.",
  "sources": "Internal modules such as .app, .blueprints, .config, .ctx, .globals, .helpers, .signals, .templating, .wrappers",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, no untrusted input handling, no network activity",
  "flows": "N/A; static import statements without data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import statements, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, serving as a setup or re-export module for framework components. There are no dynamic elements, external inputs, network interactions, or data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The import statements are standard for a framework's core module, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module import setup for a web framework, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores should reflect this, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score 0.",
