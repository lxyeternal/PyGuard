{
  "purpose": "Provides testing utilities for Flask applications, including environment setup, request simulation, session management, and CLI invocation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, configuration attributes, imported modules, request and session data, version retrieval functions.",
  "sinks": "Request environment, session storage, response headers, environment copying, request object creation.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (config, environment, request data) flow into request and session handling, environment copying, and request creation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard testing utilities for Flask, leveraging common libraries such as Werkzeug and Click. It manages environment setup, request simulation, session handling, and CLI testing in a typical manner. No malicious patterns, external data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code structure and comments indicate routine testing infrastructure. The use of version retrieval and environment copying is benign. No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing infrastructure for Flask applications, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
