{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a remote URL ('https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe') using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest command.",
  "sinks": "The downloaded file is executed via PowerShell's Start-Process, which runs the file without user interaction.",
  "flows": "The code flows from downloading the remote executable (source) to executing it (sink) immediately after download.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable file from an external URL and runs it silently during installation. This behavior is unusual and suspicious for a package installer. No validation or integrity checks are performed on the downloaded file. The use of PowerShell commands for remote download and execution is indicative of potentially malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard Python package installation process to include an additional step: downloading an executable from a remote URL using PowerShell and executing it immediately. The download command uses Invoke-WebRequest, which fetches the executable without validation. If successful, the script runs the downloaded executable via Start-Process. Such behavior can be exploited to deliver malware, perform malicious actions, or establish backdoors. The code does not include any safeguards, such as signature verification or user consent, raising significant security concerns. This pattern is characteristic of malicious or supply chain attack code designed to run arbitrary code during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a potentially malicious activity by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation, which could compromise the system. This behavior is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious. The package should be avoided or thoroughly scrutinized before use.",
