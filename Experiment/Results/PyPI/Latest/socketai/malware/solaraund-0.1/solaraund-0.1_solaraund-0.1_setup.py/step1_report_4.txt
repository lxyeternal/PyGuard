{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the download URL, executes PowerShell commands to download and open a file, and checks for download success.",
  "sinks": "Execution of PowerShell commands that download and run an external executable file.",
  "flows": "Download URL (source) -> PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest (sink) -> Saved file on disk (sink) -> PowerShell Start-Process (sink) to run the file.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from a GitHub URL and immediately executes it during installation, which is highly unusual and suspicious behavior. No validation or user confirmation is performed before execution. The filename 'CBLines.exe' is hardcoded, and the code directly executes the downloaded file without integrity checks.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard installation process to include downloading an external executable from a remote URL. It uses PowerShell commands invoked via subprocess to perform the download and to execute the downloaded file. This behavior indicates a deliberate attempt to fetch and run potentially malicious code at installation time. The process lacks any verification of the downloaded content and executes it directly, increasing the risk of executing malicious payloads. The URL points to a raw file on GitHub, which could be malicious if malicious actors update the file. The use of subprocess with shell=True raises further security concerns, as it could be exploited or lead to command injection in other contexts. Overall, this behavior is highly suspicious and strongly indicative of malicious intent or supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without verification. It poses a severe security risk, effectively acting as a supply chain attack mechanism. The code is intentionally malicious, and the behavior should be flagged as high risk.",
