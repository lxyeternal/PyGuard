{
  "purpose": "Custom installer that downloads and executes an external executable during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the download URL and the output file path; it executes PowerShell commands to download and run a file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of PowerShell commands that download and execute an external executable; potentially runs malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves a file from a remote URL, saves it locally, then executes it, which could lead to remote code execution or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of downloading and executing an external executable during package installation; no validation of downloaded file; use of PowerShell to run external commands without restrictions.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the standard installation process to include a step where it downloads an executable from a specified URL using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. It then attempts to run the downloaded executable using PowerShell's Start-Process. This behavior is suspicious because it automatically fetches and executes external code during package installation, which is a common technique for malware delivery. No checksums, signatures, or validation are performed on the downloaded file. The executable is run without user confirmation or sandboxing, posing a significant security risk. This pattern indicates malicious intent or at least malicious potential, as it can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or other malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent by downloading and executing an external executable during package installation without validation or user consent. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain malware and should be considered highly dangerous.",
