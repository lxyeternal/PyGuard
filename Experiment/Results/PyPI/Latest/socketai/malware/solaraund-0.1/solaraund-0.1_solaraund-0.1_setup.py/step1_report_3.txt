{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process to download and execute an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the network via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest and starts a process to open the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "The 'Start-Process' command opens the downloaded executable, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Input: Download URL (external source) -> Downloaded file -> Executed via Start-Process",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external URL during installation and automatically runs it without user consent or verification, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard installation process to download an executable file from a GitHub URL using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. If successful, it automatically opens the file using Start-Process, executing the downloaded payload. This behavior can be used to deliver malware or malicious payloads during package installation. The code does not verify the integrity or authenticity of the downloaded file, increasing the risk. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell commands for downloading and executing external files during install is a significant security concern, indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential by downloading and executing an external payload during installation without validation or user consent. This behavior suggests malicious intent and constitutes a security risk, making the package highly dangerous to install.",
