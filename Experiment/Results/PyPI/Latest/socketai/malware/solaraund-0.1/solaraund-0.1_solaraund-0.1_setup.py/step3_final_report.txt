{
  "purpose": "The code overrides the setup installation process to download and execute an external executable from a remote URL during package installation, without validation or user consent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the internet via PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest and from the local filesystem when checking for the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded executable directly using PowerShell's Start-Process, which can lead to remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "The source (download via Invoke-WebRequest) leads directly to the sink (execution with Start-Process) without validation, creating a direct source-to-sink flow that executes untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an external file during installation and executes it immediately without validation, signature check, or user confirmation. It uses subprocess with shell=True to run PowerShell commands embedded as strings.",
  "analysis": "The code explicitly downloads an executable from a remote URL during installation, then runs it without validation or user interaction. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware. The use of PowerShell commands via subprocess is straightforward but risky. The behavior is malicious, as it can lead to remote code execution. The code contains no obfuscation; it is clear and direct. The malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should also be 1, reflecting the high danger. The absence of validation, combined with immediate execution of external code, makes this highly dangerous. The reports correctly identify this pattern, and their scores are justified, though the malware score should be maximized for clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a malicious activity by downloading and executing an external executable during installation without validation, representing a severe supply chain security risk. The behavior is clearly malicious, warranting maximum malware and security risk scores. The code should be flagged as malicious and avoided in any secure environment.",
