{
  "purpose": "To perform a custom installation process that downloads and executes an external executable file during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the internet via PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest, specifically downloading a file from a GitHub URL.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the downloaded file using Start-Process, which can execute arbitrary code contained within the file.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the URL (source) through the download command to the file system, then the file is executed via Start-Process, creating a potential malicious execution path.",
  "anomalies": "The code downloads an executable from an external URL and then automatically runs it during installation without any user confirmation or validation. No checksums or signatures are verified. The use of PowerShell commands embedded as strings is also suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the standard setup install command to include a step that downloads an executable from a remote source and immediately executes it. This behavior is highly suspicious, as it allows remote code execution during package installation. The absence of validation, confirmation, or user interaction suggests malicious intent or at least risky behavior. The code does not contain obfuscated elements, but its logic of downloading and executing arbitrary code during setup is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs potentially malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation, which can lead to remote code execution and system compromise. This pattern is typical of supply chain attacks or malware embedding. The code should not be used without thorough validation and security review.",
