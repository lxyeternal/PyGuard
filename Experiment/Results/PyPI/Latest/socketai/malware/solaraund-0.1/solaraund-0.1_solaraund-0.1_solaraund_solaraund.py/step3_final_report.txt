  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'hello' with no external data or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static code with no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only prints a static string without external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static output with no external data or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial print statement with no external dependencies, data flow, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code does not interact with external systems, handle untrusted data, or contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The analysis confirms that the code is entirely safe, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risk. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
