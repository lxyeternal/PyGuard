{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package called 'huggingleg' and conditionally executes a shell command to download and run a remote executable.",
  "sources": "The environment variable 'X' and the OS system call that executes a wget command.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call that executes a remote wget, chmod, and background execution of a potentially malicious binary.",
  "flows": "If environment variable 'X' is not 'True', the code fetches a binary from a remote IP, makes it executable, and runs it in the background.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional remote code execution based on an environment variable; fetching and executing a binary from an IP address; no verification of the remote content; hardcoded IP address; use of os.system for command execution.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing setup from distutils and os module. It checks whether the environment variable 'X' is set to 'True'; if not, it executes a shell command that downloads a file from a hardcoded IP address, sets execute permissions, and runs it in the background. This behavior is suspicious because it actively fetches and executes a remote binary without validation, which is indicative of malicious activity such as malware delivery or backdoor installation. The setup function then defines the package metadata. The key concern is the conditional remote fetch and execution, which could be used to inject malicious code into the environment. No other suspicious or obfuscated code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote binary without verification, representing a high security risk. It is likely intended to compromise the system upon package installation unless the environment variable 'X' is explicitly set to 'True'.",
