  "purpose": "Custom installer that gathers system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for uname, ifconfig, curl, systeminfo, ipconfig, whoami, hostname; os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call that executes a curl command to send collected data to a remote Slack webhook.",
  "flows": "Data collected via os.popen() is formatted into a JSON payload and sent via os.system() to a remote URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during installation; use of os.popen() and os.system() to execute shell commands that collect sensitive info and send it externally.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, executes system commands to gather OS info, network configuration, current user, and hostname. It then formats these details into a JSON string and sends it to a Slack webhook URL using a curl command executed via os.system(). This behavior indicates data exfiltration of sensitive system information during the package installation process. No malicious code like file damage, cryptomining, or backdoors is present, but the behavior of secretly transmitting system info without user consent is malicious and could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. The code's structure and use of shell commands for data collection and exfiltration suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates sensitive system information during package installation, indicating malicious behavior. It does not contain typical malware like file destruction or cryptomining but employs covert data transmission. This behavior is malicious and should be flagged as a security concern.",
