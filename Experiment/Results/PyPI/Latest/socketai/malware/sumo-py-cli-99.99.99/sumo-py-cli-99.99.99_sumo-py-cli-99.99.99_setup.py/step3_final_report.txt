{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information during package installation and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for uname, ifconfig, systeminfo, ipconfig, whoami, hostname; os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing curl command to send JSON payload to external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info commands) -> JSON payload construction -> sink (curl command) sending data externally during install.",
  "anomalies": "Covert data exfiltration during package installation without user knowledge, use of hardcoded webhook URL, no validation or sanitization of data.",
  "analysis": "The code executes platform-specific commands to gather system details, constructs a JSON payload, and sends it via a curl command embedded in os.system() to a hardcoded URL during the install process. This behavior indicates covert data collection and exfiltration, with no user consent or validation, constituting malicious activity. The commands used are straightforward, with no obfuscation present. The data exfiltration pattern is consistent across platforms and occurs during package setup, representing a privacy invasion and potential security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs malicious covert data exfiltration during package installation, violating user privacy and security norms. It should be classified with a high malware score (~0.9) and security risk (~0.9), with no obfuscation (0). The behavior warrants caution and should be flagged as malicious.",
