{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that gathers system information and sends it via a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for uname, ifconfig, curl, whoami, hostname, and systeminfo; os.getcwd() for current directory; potentially user or system data accessible through these commands.",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a curl command that posts system info to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System commands (sources) are executed, and their outputs are collected and then formatted into a JSON payload, which is sent via os.system() to the external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of system commands to collect detailed system info and then exfiltrate it via an HTTP POST request to an external Slack webhook; no user consent or obvious purpose; hardcoded webhook URL; execution during package installation without user awareness.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the setup process to run custom code during installation. It collects various system details such as OS info, IP addresses, hostname, user info, and current directory using platform-specific commands. It then constructs a JSON message containing this information and sends it via a curl command to a Slack webhook URL. The data collection includes potentially sensitive system information. The webhook URL appears hardcoded and is used to exfiltrate data automatically. The code lacks any indication of user permission, transparency, or opt-out mechanism. These behaviors strongly suggest malicious intent in terms of data exfiltration and privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to surreptitiously gather detailed system information during package installation and send it to an external server without user consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The behavior aligns with data exfiltration malware or spyware techniques.",
