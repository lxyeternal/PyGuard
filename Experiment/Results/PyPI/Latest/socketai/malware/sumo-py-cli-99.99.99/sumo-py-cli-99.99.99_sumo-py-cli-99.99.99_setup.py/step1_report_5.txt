{
  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a specified Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system info via os.popen and subprocess calls; executing system commands like 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'whoami', 'hostname', 'systeminfo', 'ipconfig', 'tasklist'.",
  "sinks": "os.system call that sends a POST request with collected data to an external URL (Slack webhook).",
  "flows": "Sources (system commands and os.popen reads) feed data into variables; these variables are formatted into a JSON payload and sent via os.system call to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Code unconditionally collects sensitive system info and posts it externally without user consent or validation; uses hardcoded webhook URL; sends host info, user info, and system details during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that overrides the run method. During installation, it gathers system information based on OS detected, such as hostname, user, IP info, and OS details via system commands. All data are stored in variables, then formatted into a JSON string and sent via a curl POST request to a Slack webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating potential exfiltration. The approach of collecting and transmitting system details during package install without user consent suggests malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. The code uses shell commands and os.system calls, which are common in malicious scripts for data exfiltration. No validation, encryption, or obfuscation is used, further indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to implement a privacy-invasive data collection mechanism that exfiltrates system information to an external service during package installation. The hardcoded webhook and collection of sensitive data without user knowledge indicate malicious behavior and security risk.",
