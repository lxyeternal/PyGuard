{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process of a Python package to collect system information and send it to a specified Slack webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for uname, ifconfig, curl, whoami, hostname, systeminfo; os.system() call for curl POST request",
  "sinks": "os.system() executing a curl command that sends data to an external URL",
  "flows": "Data from system commands (sources) is embedded into a JSON payload and sent via an external POST request (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() and os.system() for executing shell commands; sending potentially sensitive system info to external URL without user consent; no input validation or sanitization; hardcoded URL and payload structure; code runs during package installation, which is unusual",
  "analysis": "The code hooks into the package installation process via a custom install class. It collects various system details depending on the platform using os.popen() for commands like uname, ifconfig, systeminfo, etc., which could reveal system info. It then constructs a JSON payload containing this info and makes an external POST request to a Slack webhook URL using os.system() with curl. The data transmitted includes hostname, username, public IP, current directory, OS info, and other system details. The method of data collection and transmission appears to be designed for covert data exfiltration. The code does not sanitize or validate any of the system command outputs, nor does it check for user permissions. The usage of hardcoded webhook URL and inclusion of system info during install could be used maliciously for reconnaissance or data harvesting.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by collecting system information covertly during package installation and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent. The use of shell commands and external requests during setup is suspicious and could be used for malicious data theft or system reconnaissance.",
