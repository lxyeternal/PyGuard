  "purpose": "Initialize and export a system tracker object and package version information.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'tracker' module",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication observed",
  "flows": "The SystemTracker instance is created upon import, no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; straightforward initialization and export",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module 'tracker' and initializes a SystemTracker object immediately upon import, then exposes a version string. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. The immediate instantiation of SystemTracker could be standard behavior depending on its implementation, but based solely on this code snippet, it appears benign. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears benign. It initializes a system tracking object and exports version info with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
