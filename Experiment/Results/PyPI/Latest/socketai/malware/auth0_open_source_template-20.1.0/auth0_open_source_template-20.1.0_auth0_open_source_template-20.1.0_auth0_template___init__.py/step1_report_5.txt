{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a system tracker object upon import and sets a version string, likely for monitoring or telemetry purposes within a package.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a local module '.tracker' to instantiate SystemTracker.",
  "sinks": "The instantiation of SystemTracker may involve data collection or system monitoring, but no explicit sinks for data leakage or network transmission are visible.",
  "flows": "Importing and executing 'SystemTracker()' flows from module import to object creation, possibly involving internal data collection within 'SystemTracker'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and creates an instance at import time, which could involve internal tracking or monitoring mechanisms. The version string is a static metadata attribute. Without access to the implementation of 'SystemTracker', no malicious behavior can be definitively identified. The code structure is typical for package initialization, and no suspicious activity or malicious code appears to be present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard initialization pattern for a package that sets up system tracking and versioning. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based solely on this fragment.",
