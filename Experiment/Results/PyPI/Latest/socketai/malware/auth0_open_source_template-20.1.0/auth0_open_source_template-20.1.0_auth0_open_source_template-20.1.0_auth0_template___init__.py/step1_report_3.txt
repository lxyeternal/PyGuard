  "purpose": "Initialize and export a system tracker object for monitoring purposes within the package.",
  "sources": "Importing SystemTracker from a local module, executing _tracker = SystemTracker()",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations observed",
  "flows": "Import of SystemTracker -> Instantiation of _tracker object",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage appears straightforward and typical for package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named SystemTracker from a local module, then creates an instance of it at import time, and defines a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscated code. The pattern is common for setting up tracking or monitoring functionalities within a package. Without inspecting the implementation of SystemTracker, it is impossible to fully confirm its behavior, but the code as presented does not exhibit malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign package initialization script that sets up a tracking object. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
