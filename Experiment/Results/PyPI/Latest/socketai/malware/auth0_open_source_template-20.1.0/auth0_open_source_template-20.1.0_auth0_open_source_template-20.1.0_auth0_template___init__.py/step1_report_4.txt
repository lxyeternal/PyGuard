There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The use of SystemTracker could be for legitimate system monitoring or analytics. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard initialization pattern for a package component, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
