  "purpose": "Initialize a system tracker object upon package import for monitoring or telemetry purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for .tracker module, instantiation of SystemTracker object",
  "sinks": "Potential internal behavior of SystemTracker (not visible here), which could include data collection or network activity",
  "flows": "Import -> instantiate SystemTracker -> store in _tracker variable",
  "anomalies": "Immediate instantiation of SystemTracker at import time; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and creates an instance of SystemTracker immediately upon import, exposing a version string. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or data leaks are evident in this snippet. The risk depends entirely on the internal implementation of SystemTracker, which is not provided. The code is straightforward and typical for package initialization. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: ~0.1) are consistent with a benign assessment, assuming SystemTracker is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are visible. The main concern is the potential internal behavior of SystemTracker, but based solely on this code, the behavior appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The minimal security risk score reflects cautious acknowledgment of the unknown internal behavior of SystemTracker. Unless further details indicate malicious activity within SystemTracker, the current assessment remains valid.",
