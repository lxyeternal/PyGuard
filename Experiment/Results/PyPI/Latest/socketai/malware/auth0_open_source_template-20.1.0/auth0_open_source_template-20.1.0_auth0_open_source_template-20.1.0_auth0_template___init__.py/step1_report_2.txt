  "purpose": "Initialize and export a system tracker object and package version information",
  "sources": "Import statement for SystemTracker; initialization of _tracker",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or other data sinks",
  "anomalies": "Simple object instantiation; no hardcoded secrets, no unusual behavior or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named SystemTracker from a local module, then instantiates it immediately upon package import. It also exports a version string. There is no indication of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code. The tracker object could be used for internal monitoring, but nothing in this snippet suggests malicious intent. The code is straightforward and follows common patterns for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard package setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The immediate instantiation of SystemTracker warrants further review if the implementation of SystemTracker itself is malicious, but based on this snippet alone, it seems benign.",
