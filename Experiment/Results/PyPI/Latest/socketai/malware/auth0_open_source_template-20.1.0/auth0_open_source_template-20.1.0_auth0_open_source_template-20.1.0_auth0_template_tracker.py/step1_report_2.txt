{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information (hostname, IP, OS details, install path, and a UUID) and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), platform module, uuid.uuid4(), and __file__ for install path.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post method sends the collected data to the provided webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered in _get_system_info() and then transmitted over the network in _send_system_info() via requests.post.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code does not perform any suspicious or malicious activity. The webhook URL could potentially be used for data exfiltration if misused, but it appears configurable and benign in intent.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system information including hostname, IP address, OS details, installation path, and a generated UUID. It then sends this data to a remote webhook URL. The code does not contain malicious actions such as data theft, backdoors, or system manipulation. The use of a webhook URL allows remote data collection, which could be privacy-invasive if the URL is malicious or unknown, but the code itself is straightforward and not inherently malicious. The silent exception handling could hide errors but does not contribute to malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for system information reporting, potentially for legitimate purposes such as system auditing or telemetry. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or malware features. The primary concern is privacy invasion if used without user consent, but from a security standpoint, it is not malicious.",
