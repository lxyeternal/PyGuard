  "purpose": "Collect and send system information (hostname, IP, OS details, install path, unique ID) to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname, IP address via socket, OS info via platform, installation path via __file__, generates UUID for installation.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via HTTP POST request to the provided webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Data collected in _get_system_info() is sent directly to the webhook URL in _send_system_info().",
  "anomalies": "Uses a hardcoded webhook URL; generates a UUID each time; silently catches exceptions in network call and info gathering; no validation or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system info, including hostname, IP, OS details, installation path, and a generated UUID. It then transmits this data to a specified webhook URL without user consent or validation. The webhook URL is hardcoded, which indicates potential tracking or data exfiltration intentions. The UUID is generated anew each time, suggesting tracking of individual installs rather than persistent identification. Exception handling is silent, which can mask failures. Overall, the code acts as a system information logger with potential privacy implications but does not perform malicious actions such as data theft or system modification.",
  "conclusion": "This code collects detailed system information and sends it to an external server via a webhook. While it does not contain overt malicious actions like data exfiltration or system damage, its behavior resembles tracking or surveillance functions. The use of a hardcoded webhook and silent error handling increases suspicion. It warrants caution if included in a package without clear disclosure.",
