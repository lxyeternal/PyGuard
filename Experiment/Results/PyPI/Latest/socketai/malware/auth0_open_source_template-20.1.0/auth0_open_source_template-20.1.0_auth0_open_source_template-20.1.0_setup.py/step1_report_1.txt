  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'auth0-open-source-template'.",
  "sources": "Reading package requirements, package metadata, and reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or code execution paths are present.",
  "flows": "Input from 'install_requires' and 'long_description' (from file read) used for package setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Reading 'README.md' directly without error handling; minimal risk, but worth noting. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools. It specifies package information, dependencies, and metadata. No dynamic code execution, no user input processing, and no suspicious network activity. The file reads 'README.md' to include as long_description, which is typical. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected. The code does not perform any operations beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup.py file for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and appears safe. No indicators of malware or security risks.",
