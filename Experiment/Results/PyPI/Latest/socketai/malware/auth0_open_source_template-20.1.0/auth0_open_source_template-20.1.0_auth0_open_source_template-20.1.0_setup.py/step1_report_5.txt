{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for an open-source Python package related to Auth0 templates",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from 'install_requires' and reads the README.md file for long description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; no network, file, or environment variable manipulations detected",
  "flows": "The dependency list and file read operations are isolated; no flow from untrusted input to dangerous actions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to configure package setup, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package info. It reads a local README file for description, which is typical. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors are present. All operations are standard for package distribution. The dependencies and metadata pose no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
