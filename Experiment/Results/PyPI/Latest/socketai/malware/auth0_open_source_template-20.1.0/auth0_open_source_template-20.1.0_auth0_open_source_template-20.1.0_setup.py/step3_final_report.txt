  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Reading local file 'README.md' during setup; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and reads a local README file for description. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or obfuscated patterns. The only minor concern is reading a file without error handling, which is common in setup scripts and not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minimal risk associated with reading a local file is acceptable and does not indicate any security threat.",
