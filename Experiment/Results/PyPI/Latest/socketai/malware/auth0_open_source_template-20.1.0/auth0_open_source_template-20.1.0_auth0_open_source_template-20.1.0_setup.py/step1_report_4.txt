{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'auth0-open-source-template', specifying dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package requirements from the 'install_requires' list and reads the content of 'README.md' for the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network, file, or environment variable manipulation is directly observed.",
  "flows": "The package setup reads static metadata and dependencies; no dynamic data flows or external input processing are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The 'author' and 'author_email' fields are placeholders but not malicious. The use of 'open' to read 'README.md' is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions for package setup, including reading a README file for long description. All data appears static and intended for package metadata. No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior is detected. The placeholders in author fields are typical for template code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard configuration file for distributing a Python package.",
