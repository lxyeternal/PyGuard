{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs the 'voto3' package and executes a post-installation hook that sends data to an external URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads platform information using 'platform.node()' and 'platform.system()'.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get()' function sends data to an external webhook URL, potentially leaking system information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'platform.node()' and 'platform.system()' to the URL via string formatting, then sent over the network using 'requests.get()'.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request during installation without user consent or obvious necessity, which is unusual. The URL used ('webhook.site') is a service often used for capturing data, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking. The code does not sanitize or obfuscate the data sent, and the purpose of this network call is unclear outside of data collection.",
  "analysis": "The script installs a Python package and defines a custom install command that, after installation, executes a function 'send()'. This function sends a GET request to a webhook URL, passing system information ('platform.node()' and 'platform.system()') as URL parameters. This behavior occurs automatically upon package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious, as it secretly exfiltrates system data without user knowledge. The URL 'webhook.site' is commonly used for capturing data for testing or malicious purposes. There is no legitimate reason for a package to send system information to an external server during installation. The package dependencies are standard, and no other malicious or suspicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior of sending system information to an external server during installation, which is likely intended for tracking or exfiltration purposes. This behavior is suspicious and indicates potential malicious intent or privacy invasion.",
