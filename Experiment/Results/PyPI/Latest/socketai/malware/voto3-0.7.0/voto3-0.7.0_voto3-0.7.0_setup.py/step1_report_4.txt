{
  "purpose": "To set up and install the 'voto3' Python package, including a post-installation step that sends system information to a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The 'send' function makes a GET request to an external URL with system info embedded in the URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get()' call in 'send' sends data over the network to a remote server, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method in 'PostInstallCommand' executes 'send', which sends system info to an external URL via 'requests.get()'.",
  "anomalies": "The post-installation code automatically transmits system node name and OS info to an external server without user consent. The URL used is a webhook for tracking or logging purposes, and this activity occurs silently during install. Use of 'platform' as an installed requirement is unnecessary and may be a misleading dependency.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup for a package 'voto3' that, upon installation, executes a 'send' function. This function prints a message and makes a GET request to a specified webhook URL, passing system node and OS info as URL parameters. This behavior is executed automatically during the install process via a custom 'PostInstallCommand' class. The use of 'requests' for network communication is normal, but here it is employed to exfiltrate system data without explicit user knowledge or consent. The URL is a unique webhook, suggesting tracking or data collection rather than benign behavior. The inclusion of 'platform' in 'install_requires' is unusual, as it's part of the Python standard library and does not need to be installed as a dependency. Overall, the code's main concern is its silent data exfiltration during installation, which could be considered malicious or at least intrusive.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign-looking package setup but contains malicious behavior by secretly sending system information to an external URL during installation. This exfiltration is done without user awareness, raising security and privacy concerns. The package's core functionality appears standard, but the post-installation step is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
