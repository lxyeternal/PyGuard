{
  "purpose": "The code performs a post-installation action that sends system information (hostname and OS) to an external webhook URL via an HTTP GET request.",
  "sources": "Reads system info from platform.node() and platform.system() during the send() function execution.",
  "sinks": "Requests to a fixed external URL with embedded system info, leading to potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "System info from platform functions → URL string → requests.get() call to external webhook.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic, silent transmission of system data during package installation without user notification or consent; inclusion of 'platform' in install_requires is unnecessary.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, upon execution, calls send(), which constructs a URL embedding system info and performs an HTTP GET request to a webhook URL. This occurs automatically during installation, indicating potential privacy invasion or malicious data exfiltration. The code uses standard libraries but performs an unsolicited network request, which is suspicious. The activity aligns with malicious supply chain behavior, as it exfiltrates data without user awareness. The malware score should reflect high malicious potential due to privacy invasion, and the security risk score should be high as well. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated, and the behavior is consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits a clear malicious or privacy-invasive behavior by silently exfiltrating system information during installation. While it does not execute malicious payloads or obfuscated code, the automatic data transmission to an external endpoint without user consent warrants a high malware and security risk score. The behavior is consistent with malicious supply chain activities, and the scores should be adjusted to reflect this severity.",
