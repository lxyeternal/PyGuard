  "conclusion": "The package exhibits a clear malicious or privacy-invasive behavior by silently exfiltrating system information during installation. While it does not execute malicious payloads or obfuscated code, the automatic data transmission to an external endpoint without user consent warrants a high malware and security risk score. The behavior is consistent with malicious supply chain activities, and the scores should be adjusted to reflect this severity."
