{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'voto3' with a custom post-installation step that performs an HTTP GET request to a specified webhook URL, passing system information as query parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using platform.node() and platform.system() to construct the URL for the request.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() function sends an HTTP request to an external URL with potentially sensitive system data included in the query parameters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the system information sources (platform.node(), platform.system()) into the URL string, which is then used by requests.get() to transmit data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a post-install hook that automatically sends system-specific information to an external URL without user consent or explicit notification. The webhook URL appears fixed and is not documented as part of package functionality, indicating potential privacy leakage or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation command 'PostInstallCommand' that runs the 'send()' function after installation. The 'send()' function constructs a URL containing the system's node name and OS name, then makes a GET request to an external webhook URL. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, without user awareness. Such activity could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or data exfiltration. The use of standard libraries ('setuptools', 'requests', 'platform') alone is not suspicious, but the automatic data transmission to an external server raises privacy concerns and potential malicious intent. No other malicious behavior or backdoors are evident outside this activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an apparently benign package setup but contains a hidden tracking mechanism that transmits system information to an external URL during installation. This behavior could be malicious or a privacy violation, depending on context. The core issue is the automatic data exfiltration embedded in the post-install process.",
