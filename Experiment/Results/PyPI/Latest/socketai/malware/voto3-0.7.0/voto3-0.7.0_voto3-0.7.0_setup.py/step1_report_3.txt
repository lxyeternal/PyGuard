{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs the 'voto3' package and executes a post-installation hook that sends system information to a remote URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via the 'platform' module and executes an HTTP GET request using the 'requests' library in the 'send' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get' call transmits data to an external URL, potentially exposing system information without user consent.",
  "flows": "The flow involves gathering system data with 'platform.node()' and 'platform.system()', then sending this data over the network via 'requests.get' to a remote webhook URL during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install hook automatically transmits system info to an external server without user notification or consent, which is suspicious. Use of 'requests' in a setup script for data exfiltration is unusual and potentially malicious behavior. No validation or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send' function that constructs a URL embedding system information and performs an HTTP GET request to a specific external webhook. This function is called during the custom installation command's 'run' method, which executes during package installation. The behavior resembles data exfiltration. The use of 'platform' and 'requests' libraries is standard, but their combination in this context to leak system info without disclosure is suspicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, but the automatic data transmission indicates malicious intent. The package appears to be designed to collect and send system information without user knowledge, constituting a privacy violation and potential security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external server during installation without user consent. The mechanism is embedded in a custom post-install command that executes automatically, raising significant security and privacy concerns.",
