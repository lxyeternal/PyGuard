{
  "purpose": "Download and execute a file from a remote URL, likely for running an executable obtained from the internet.",
  "sources": "os.system command that executes a shell command to fetch and run an external executable.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file RealtekHDAudioManager.exe which is run directly after download.",
  "flows": "os.system executes curl to download the file, then immediately runs the downloaded executable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to download and execute a remote file without validation; direct execution of a potentially untrusted executable.",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system to run a shell command that downloads an executable from a GitHub URL using curl. Immediately after, it executes the downloaded file. This pattern is typical of malware behavior, especially when there is no verification of the file's integrity or authenticity. The code lacks any checksums, signatures, or user prompts. The filename 'RealtekHDAudioManager.exe' appears legitimate but is likely a decoy to disguise malicious intent. The code's simplicity and direct execution raise significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by automatically downloading and executing an external executable without validation. It has a high likelihood of being malicious, potentially installing unwanted or harmful software.",
