  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'embeds' library.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata defined within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic behavior, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with fixed parameters, representing a typical package configuration script. No dynamic input, external data reads, network activity, or code execution beyond static configuration. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
