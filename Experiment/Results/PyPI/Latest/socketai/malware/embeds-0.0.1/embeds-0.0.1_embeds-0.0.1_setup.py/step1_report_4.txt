{
  "purpose": "To set up and package a Python library named 'embeds' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Input source is the setup() function parameters, particularly the package metadata and package list.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code primarily defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "Data flows from package metadata into the setup() configuration, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and invokes setup() with static metadata: package name, version, author, description, and package list. There are no dynamic elements, no external data reads, or code execution. It appears to be a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project named 'embeds'. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
