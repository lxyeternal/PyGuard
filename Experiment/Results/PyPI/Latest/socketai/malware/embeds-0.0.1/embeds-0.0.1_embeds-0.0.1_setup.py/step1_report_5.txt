  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or data; it only defines static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leak or system effect; the code only specifies package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is a straightforward configuration with no dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs; the code is a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "This script uses setuptools to specify package information such as name, version, author, description, and packages. It is a typical setup.py file without any dynamic execution, external data input, or suspicious logic. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no code that could be malicious or obfuscated. The code's structure and content are consistent with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module named 'embeds'. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is safe and serves its purpose of package configuration.",
