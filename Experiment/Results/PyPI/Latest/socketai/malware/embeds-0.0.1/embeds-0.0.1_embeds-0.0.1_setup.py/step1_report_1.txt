  "flows": "N/A (no data flow between sources and sinks)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behaviors, or unusual code features observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package named 'embeds'. It imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with basic package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and packages. There are no dynamic or malicious code patterns, no external network calls, and no unusual obfuscation or hidden code elements. The code appears to be standard package configuration code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It simply declares package metadata for distribution.",
