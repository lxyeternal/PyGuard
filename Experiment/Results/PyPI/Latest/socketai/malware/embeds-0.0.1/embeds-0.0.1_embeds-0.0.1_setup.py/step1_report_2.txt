  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'embeds' Python package, facilitating its distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static configuration data for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data outputs; standard setup call.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely declarative setup call.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and invokes 'setup()' with static parameters specifying package metadata. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data reads, nor any code that manipulates untrusted data. The code adheres to standard packaging practices. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely defines package metadata for distribution.",
