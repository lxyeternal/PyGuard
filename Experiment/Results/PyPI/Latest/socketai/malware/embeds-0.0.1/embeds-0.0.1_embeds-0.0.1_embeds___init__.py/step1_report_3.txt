  "purpose": "Download and execute an external executable file from a remote URL.",
  "sources": "os.system call executing 'curl' command to fetch a file from a URL.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via 'start' command, running potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "os.system('curl ...') downloads the file, then 'start' executes the downloaded executable.",
  "anomalies": "Directly downloading and executing a remote file without validation, no checksums or signatures, use of 'start' to run potentially untrusted code.",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system to run a shell command that downloads an executable from a GitHub URL via curl and then immediately executes it. There are no input validation, no checksum verification, and no sandboxing. This pattern is typical of malware or malicious supply chain behavior, as it fetches and runs an external binary without safeguards. The URL points to a raw GitHub file, which could be malicious. The code's simplicity and lack of validation are suspicious and risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an insecure download and execution of an external executable, representing high malicious intent likelihood. It likely aims to install or run malicious software on the host system without user consent or validation.",
