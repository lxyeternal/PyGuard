{
  "purpose": "Download and execute an executable file from a remote URL",
  "sources": "os.system() command that executes a shell command to run curl and start the downloaded file",
  "sinks": "Execution of RealtekHDAudioManager.exe which is downloaded from the internet",
  "flows": "os.system() executes curl to download a file, then immediately runs the downloaded executable",
  "anomalies": "Direct execution of a downloaded file without any verification, downloading from a suspicious URL, use of shell command to execute remote content",
  "analysis": "The code uses os.system() to run a shell command that downloads a file from a GitHub URL and then executes it. The URL points to a raw file that is named 'howl.exe', which could be malicious. The script automates the process of downloading and executing an external executable without any validation, integrity check, or user consent. This behavior resembles typical malicious activities such as dropping and executing malware. The absence of checks or safeguards increases the risk of executing malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code poses a high security risk due to its behavior of downloading and executing an external executable without validation, indicating likely malicious intent. It could be used for malware distribution or system compromise.",
