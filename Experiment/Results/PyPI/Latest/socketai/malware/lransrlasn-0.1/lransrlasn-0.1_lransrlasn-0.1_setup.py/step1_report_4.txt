  "purpose": "Setup script for Python package 'lransrlasn' with a potentially malicious command execution during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable check 'X', os.system call executing remote code via wget and bash",
  "sinks": "os.system command that downloads and executes a remote file",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'X' check triggers execution of remote payload through os.system",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional remote code fetch and execution triggered unless environment variable 'X' equals 'True'; hardcoded IP address; executing remote code during setup",
  "analysis": "The code checks an environment variable 'X'. If 'X' is not 'True', it executes a system command that downloads a file from a remote IP address, makes it executable, and runs it. This behavior is suspicious as it downloads and executes potentially malicious code during the package setup process. The setup function appears normal, but the initial conditional command is highly suspicious. The remote code execution could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malicious activity. The code does not sanitize or verify the remote content, indicating malicious intent or a supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious remote code execution payload that activates during package installation unless suppressed by an environment variable. This is a high-security risk, as it can lead to remote code execution on systems installing the package.",
