{
  "purpose": "Set up and install the Python package 'lransrlasn'.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('X', None), os.system()",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing a bash command to download and run a remote file",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'X' check -> conditional execution -> remote code fetch and execution",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional download and execution of code from a remote server based on an environment variable; hardcoded IP address; no validation or sandboxing",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing 'setup' from distutils.core and os. It then checks if the environment variable 'X' equals 'True'. If not, it executes a shell command that downloads a file from a specific IP address, makes it executable, and runs it. This is a clear indicator of malicious intent, as it fetches and executes remote code without validation, potentially installing malware or backdoors. The package setup information is standard, but the conditional remote execution is suspicious and malicious in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by downloading and executing a remote payload when the environment variable 'X' is not set to 'True'. This is indicative of a supply chain attack or malicious backdoor, as it silently fetches and runs external code during setup.",
