  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior through embedded credentials and covert data exfiltration mechanisms. Its persistent background processes and dynamic script execution are typical of malware designed to steal user data without consent. Therefore, it should be classified as highly malicious with maximum security risk."
