{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'quicolor' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package name, version, packages, dependencies, author info, description, keywords, URL, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or external data sources are used or processed.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow from sources to sinks; the script executes only static configuration functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and follows typical packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script employing setuptools with static metadata and dependencies. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, or external data reads. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate a benign package configuration. The dependency 'requests' is common and does not imply malicious intent. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess this, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. No further action is necessary.",
