  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'quicolor' Python utility.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies from 'install_requires' list, reads metadata from parameters such as name, version, author, and url.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could originate from the 'install_requires' or metadata fields if externally manipulated, but these are static strings; no runtime untrusted data used.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static setup parameters are used, with no user input or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. Usage of standard setuptools functions and static strings only.",
  "analysis": "This is a standard Python setup script using setuptools for packaging. All parameters are statically defined, including package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic or external data reads, no code execution beyond the typical setup process. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The dependencies listed are common and benign. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
