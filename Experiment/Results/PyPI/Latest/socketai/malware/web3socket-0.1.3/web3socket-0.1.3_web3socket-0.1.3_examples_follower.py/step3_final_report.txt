  "sinks": "socket.send(), open() output, print statements, socket.receive()",
  "flows": "environ['web3socket'] -> receive() -> socket.send() -> broadcast in update() -> serve_file() reads from filesystem",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert message is None' in receive(), broad exception handling in serve_file(), potential crashes if message is not None",
  "analysis": "The code implements a WebSocket-like server that manages connections, serves static files, and broadcasts messages. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The use of 'assert message is None' could cause crashes if messages are unexpected, but this is a robustness issue, not malicious. Exception handling is broad, which could hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with standard socket management and static file serving. No signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise are detected. The low risk score of 0.2 is justified, and malware and obfuscation scores are 0. The main concern is robustness, not security.",
