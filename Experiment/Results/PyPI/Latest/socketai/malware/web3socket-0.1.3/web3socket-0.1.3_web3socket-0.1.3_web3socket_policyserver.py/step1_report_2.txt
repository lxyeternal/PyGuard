  "purpose": "Serve a Cross-Domain Policy XML for Flash clients to allow cross-origin access on port 843.",
  "sources": "The socket connection in the handle() method receives incoming data and handles client connections.",
  "sinks": "The socket.sendall() method sends the predefined XML policy to clients; no untrusted data is sent.",
  "flows": "Connection accepted -> handle() method invoked -> socket.sendall(policy) to client.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior; code appears straightforward and intended for purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of StreamServer that responds with a static XML cross-domain policy when a client connects on port 843. It does not process or execute untrusted data, nor does it contain obfuscated code or suspicious network activity. No malicious payloads or covert channels are present. It is a standard implementation for Flash policy serving.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Flash policy server implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a necessary policy document to allow Flash clients cross-origin access, with no hidden functionalities.",
