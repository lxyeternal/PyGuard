  "purpose": "A server that serves a static cross-domain policy XML to allow Flash clients from any domain and port.",
  "sources": "Accepts incoming socket connections on port 843; no external data input processing.",
  "sinks": "Sends a fixed XML policy over the socket upon connection; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Connection accepted -> optional logging -> send static XML policy -> close connection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code; broad policy scope allowing all domains and ports.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple, standard Flash cross-domain policy server. It serves a static XML allowing access from all domains and ports, which is typical but potentially insecure if misused. No malicious code, obfuscation, or data leakage is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the straightforward implementation. The security risk score (0.2-0.3) reflects the permissive policy but does not indicate active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a standard cross-domain policy with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The permissiveness of the policy XML is a security consideration but not malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
