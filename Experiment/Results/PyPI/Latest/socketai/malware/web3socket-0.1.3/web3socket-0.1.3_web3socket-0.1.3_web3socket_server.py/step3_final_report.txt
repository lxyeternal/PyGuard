{
  "purpose": "The code implements a custom WSGI server with WebSocket support, static file serving, and policy server management, handling environment variables, request data, filesystem, and network sockets.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'PATH_INFO', 'HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH'), filesystem files (static assets), network sockets, request data, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Writing to stderr, logs, HTTP response headers and body, filesystem (reading static files), socket management, and server lifecycle controls.",
  "flows": "Input flows from environment variables and request data into request handling; static files are served based on filesystem data with MD5-based ETags; server manages WebSocket connections and policy server lifecycle.",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling that may hide errors, dynamic construction of file paths without validation, use of 'assert' for version checks, static file serving without validation or sanitization, and lack of input validation or authentication mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical server implementation for WebSocket and static file serving, with environment-based request handling and server lifecycle management. No signs of malicious activity such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. Exception handling is broad, which could mask errors, and static file serving without validation could be exploited in misconfigured environments. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious network activity. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.2-0.4) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential security considerations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate server implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slightly elevated security risk score reflects potential misconfiguration or lack of validation, but no active threats are present.",
