  "purpose": "Start a Flash policy server using the web3socket.policyserver module",
  "sources": "Importing sys and web3socket.policyserver, initializing FlashPolicyServer, and reading server_host/server_port for logging",
  "sinks": "Printing server address to standard error",
  "flows": "Server initialization and start, then logging server address",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard server startup and logging; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, initializes a FlashPolicyServer instance with noisy output, starts the server, and logs the server's host and port to standard error. The server is a policy server likely related to Flash socket security policies, not inherently malicious. No user input, untrusted data, or external connections are handled in a manner that could lead to security issues. The code is straightforward, with no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for starting a Flash policy server without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain suspicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
