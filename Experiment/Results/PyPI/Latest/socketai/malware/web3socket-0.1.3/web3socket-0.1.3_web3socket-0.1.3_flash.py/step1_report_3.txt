  "purpose": "Starts a Flash policy server for Web3socket and runs it to listen for incoming connections.",
  "sources": "Importing the FlashPolicyServer class and calling server.start() and server.serve_forever() methods.",
  "sinks": "The server listens on a network port, potentially accepting incoming network connections.",
  "flows": "Server initialization -> server.start() -> server.serve_forever() (listening for incoming network connections).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears to be a straightforward server initialization and start. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a server class, initializes it with a 'noisy' flag, and starts the server, which begins listening on a network port. It outputs status information to standard error. The code relies on an external module 'web3socket.policyserver', and the behavior appears to be to serve a flash policy for WebSocket connections. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The server's purpose is likely related to enabling WebSocket connections by providing necessary cross-domain policies. There are no indicators of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or malicious network activity initiated from this script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple server initializer for a WebSocket flash policy server. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior based on the provided snippet. No security risks or malware are detected.",
