{
  "purpose": "The script starts a Flash policy server from the web3socket.policyserver module, likely for handling WebSocket connections in a development or testing environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it only imports modules and starts a server.",
  "sinks": "The server's start and serve_forever methods are invoked; these could potentially handle network connections but are not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted data flows into the code; server initialization flows into server start and serve functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The code simply starts a server; no suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the FlashPolicyServer class from web3socket.policyserver, instantiates it with a noisy parameter, and starts the server. It then logs the server's host and port to stderr and runs serve_forever. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The script appears to be a straightforward server startup routine for WebSocket policy handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign script that initializes and runs a WebSocket flash policy server. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
