{
  "purpose": "The script initializes and starts a Flash Policy Server for WebSocket connections, primarily to serve cross-domain policy files required by Flash clients.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only initializes and runs a server object.",
  "sinks": "The server's start method potentially binds to a network port, which could be exploited if misconfigured, but in this context, it appears standard.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources; the code only sets up and runs a server.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No external data inputs or suspicious network behavior beyond standard server startup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class, instantiates it with a 'noisy' flag, and starts it. It logs the server's host and port to standard error. There are no dynamic inputs, user inputs, or external data sources. The server likely serves cross-domain policy files for Flash clients, which is a common and benign operation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or inputs indicate low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward server initialization for serving Flash policy files. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
