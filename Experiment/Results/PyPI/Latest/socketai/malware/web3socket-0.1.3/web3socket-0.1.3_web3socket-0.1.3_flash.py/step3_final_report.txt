{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and runs a FlashPolicyServer to serve cross-domain policy files for Flash clients.",
  "sources": "The server reads incoming network connection requests on the specified host and port.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the network socket where the server listens for incoming connections.",
  "flows": "Network connection requests flow from external clients to the server's listening socket; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a server class, instantiates it with a 'noisy' parameter, logs server details to standard error, and starts serving indefinitely. It does not process external inputs or handle sensitive data. The purpose is benign, serving cross-domain policies for Flash, which is a common operation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The server binds to a network port, which could be misused if misconfigured, but this is standard behavior. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with a benign server operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs a standard operation for serving Flash cross-domain policies. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
