{
  "purpose": "The script initializes and starts a Flash Policy Server for web socket security policy management.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data directly.",
  "sinks": "The server.start() and server.serve_forever() methods may initiate network listening and potentially serve data to clients.",
  "flows": "The server setup flow involves creating a server object, starting it, and then keeping it running indefinitely.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports, and no unusual code behavior. The comment notes the server starts a flash policy server, which is standard for socket security policies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Web3socket policy server class and starts a flash policy server, which is used to serve cross-domain socket security policies. The script is straightforward, with no input handling or data manipulation. It simply initializes and runs the server, with a print statement to stderr indicating listening status. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The purpose appears to be to facilitate socket connections securely, without suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a standard WebSocket security policy server initializer with no evidence of malicious behavior. It has no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity within the code, and does not perform any malicious actions. It is likely safe.",
