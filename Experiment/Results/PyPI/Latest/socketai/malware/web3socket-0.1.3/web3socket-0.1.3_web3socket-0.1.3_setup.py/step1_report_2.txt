{
  "purpose": "To set up and package the 'web3socket' Python project for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'web3socket/__init__.py' file.",
  "sinks": "None identified that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads the version string from a file; passes configuration data to 'setup' function.",
  "anomalies": "The only dynamic code is extracting the version string from a file using regex, which is standard practice; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical setup process for a Python package, importing setup functions, extracting version info from the package's __init__.py, and calling setup() with package metadata and dependencies. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources beyond reading a version string from a local file, which is a common pattern. The code does not execute or evaluate untrusted data, nor does it contain any suspicious or malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely handles package configuration and version extraction, which are typical and safe operations.",
