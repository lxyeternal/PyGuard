  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'web3socket' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from 'web3socket/__init__.py' via regex.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from package file -> used in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code extracts version info using regex; no apparent anomalies or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: imports setup functions, reads version info from a file, and calls setup() with metadata. The version is extracted using regex from a specific file, which is typical for version management. No external input handling, no network connections, no code injections or backdoors. All dependencies and data are explicitly listed and benign. The script does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely handles package configuration and version extraction without any malicious intent.",
