{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'web3socket' Python package, used to configure package metadata and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'web3socket/__init__.py' using regex.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Extracts version from local file, then passes static data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to extract version info, which is standard but could be manipulated if source file is tampered with; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup operations. It imports setup tools, extracts version info via regex, and calls setup() with package metadata. No external inputs, network activity, or code injection are present. The regex extraction is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or backdoors are identified. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign analysis. The code's simplicity and standard structure confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The regex-based version extraction, while dynamic, is a common practice and not malicious. The overall assessment indicates the package is safe to use.",
