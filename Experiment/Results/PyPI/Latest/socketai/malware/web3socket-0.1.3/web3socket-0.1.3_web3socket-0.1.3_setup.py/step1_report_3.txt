{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for the 'web3socket' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from 'web3socket/__init__.py' to set the package version.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data; it primarily reads a version string from a file and performs package setup tasks.",
  "flows": "The version string extracted from the file flows into the 'setup' function as the package version; no other data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version info from a source file; the regex could potentially be manipulated if the source file is tampered with, but this is standard in setup scripts. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports setup tools, reads a version string from a file, and calls the setup function with package metadata and dependencies. The use of regex to extract the version is common but relies on the correctness and integrity of the source file. No user input, untrusted data, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code's purpose is purely for packaging and distribution, with no malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical, well-structured package setup file.",
