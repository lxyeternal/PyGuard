{
  "purpose": "To set up the packaging configuration for the 'web3socket' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'web3socket/__init__.py'. No other external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setup()' to install dependencies and package data; no untrusted data handling or external output that could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from the package's '__init__.py' and passes static configuration data to 'setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "The version is extracted via regex from a local file, which is typical. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, attempts to extract the version string safely using regex, and then proceeds with package setup configurations. No external inputs are used beyond reading a local file. The version extraction uses a straightforward regex pattern and assertion. No code injection, malicious network activity, or sensitive data handling is observed. The overall structure is standard for Python setup scripts, with no anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to facilitate packaging and distribution of the 'web3socket' library.",
