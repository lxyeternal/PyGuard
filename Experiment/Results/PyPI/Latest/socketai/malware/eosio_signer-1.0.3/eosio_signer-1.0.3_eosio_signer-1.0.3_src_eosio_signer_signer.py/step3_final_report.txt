{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for cryptographic signing operations, including key representation, signing, and verification methods.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameter 'private_str' (accepted but not stored or used).",
  "sinks": "No external data input or output; no data leaks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within this snippet; abstract methods are placeholders for subclass implementations.",
  "anomalies": "The constructor accepts 'private_str' but does not store or process it, indicating incomplete implementation or a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract base class defining cryptographic signing interface with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks. The unused 'private_str' parameter suggests incomplete implementation but does not pose a security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign low malware and security risk scores. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard interface definition with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The unused parameter is likely a placeholder, not a security concern. Overall, the security posture is very low risk.",
