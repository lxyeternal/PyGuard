  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .key import EOSIOKey`.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior within this snippet.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for Python modules, with no anomalies, obfuscated code, or external data handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly conclude that this is a benign import statement.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Review:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The securityRisk scores are also 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree this is a simple import with no malicious activity, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher risk score would be unjustified unless additional context indicates otherwise.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, correctly reflecting that there is no malicious activity in this snippet.\n   - The import alone does not imply malicious intent unless the imported module is malicious, which cannot be inferred here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only analyze the provided code snippet.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all zero for malware and security risk, high confidence, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed to the scores.\n\n**My Own Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** Without additional context or code, this import statement is standard and safe.",
