  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement: `from .key import EOSIOKey`. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or anomalies in this minimal snippet. The code does not execute any logic, handle untrusted input, or perform network operations.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly state that this is a benign import statement with no security risks.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.  \n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.  \n- Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- The malware scores are consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a risk score above 0.5. The code is purely an import statement with no suspicious activity.  \n- The highest confidence is 1, and all indicate no malware or security issues.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n- Since the code only imports a class from a local module and does not perform any malicious actions, the malware score should remain at 0.  \n- All reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- No reports make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet and the analysis.\n\n**Summary of My Evaluation**:  \n- The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious or security concerns.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.  \n- There is no evidence to suggest any hidden malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and does not pose security risks.",
