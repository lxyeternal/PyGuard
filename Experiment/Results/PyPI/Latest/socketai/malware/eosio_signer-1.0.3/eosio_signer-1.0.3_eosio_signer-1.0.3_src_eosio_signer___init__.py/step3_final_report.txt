  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "None; static import without data or control flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies. Given its simplicity, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign import statement with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and no score adjustments are necessary.",
