{
  "purpose": "Importing the EOSIOKey class from a local key module, likely for cryptographic or blockchain key management.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading in this snippet; the import statement itself does not read data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or system calls; this line only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this isolated code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a class from a relative module. Without additional context or implementation details of EOSIOKey or the key module, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The import does not, by itself, pose security risks or indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this isolated import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard module import, with no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
