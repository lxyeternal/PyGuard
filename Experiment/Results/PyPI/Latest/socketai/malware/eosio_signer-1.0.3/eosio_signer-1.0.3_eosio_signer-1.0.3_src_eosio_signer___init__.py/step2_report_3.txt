  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .key import EOSIOKey\n     ```\n   - There are no indications of dynamic code execution, data handling, or other potentially malicious operations.\n   - The code is minimal and appears benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - The securityRisk scores are also 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is just an import statement with no malicious or security-sensitive operations, a risk score higher than 0.0 is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 0.1 (in one report) are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, correctly reflecting that there is no malicious activity.\n   - The import itself is standard and not malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code alone does not indicate malicious intent.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk in this snippet)\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n- Given the simplicity of the code, there's no need to increase the scores.\n- If additional context or code were provided, the analysis might change, but based solely on this snippet, it is benign.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard import statement with no security issues. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments.",
