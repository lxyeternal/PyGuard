{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package installation, collects system information and environment variables, then exfiltrates this data to a remote server via an HTTP POST request.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'BX_API_HOSTNAME', 'BX_PRIVATE_KEY', 'BX_API_METADATA'; system commands 'hostname', 'whoami', 'ifconfig' executed via os.system; data written to '/tmp/r'.",
  "sinks": "Data written to '/tmp/r' and then uploaded to 'http://61.28.229.27' using curl, transmitting potentially sensitive information to an external IP.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system info are gathered, written to '/tmp/r', then transmitted via HTTP POST to the hardcoded IP address.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for sensitive data, execution of system commands, writing to a temporary file, and exfiltration to a hardcoded external IP without encryption or validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data collection of environment variables and system info during installation, writes this data to a temporary file, and exfiltrates it to an external IP address. The behavior indicates covert data theft or backdoor activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but its actions are malicious. The exfiltration pattern, use of environment variables for secrets, and hardcoded IP are typical of malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this behavior. The high confidence score (~0.9) is justified given the clear malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and environment variables and exfiltrating them to an external server during package installation. The pattern is indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor. The scores of approximately 0.9 for malware and security risk are justified and consistent with the behavior. The code should be flagged for review or removal due to its malicious intent.",
