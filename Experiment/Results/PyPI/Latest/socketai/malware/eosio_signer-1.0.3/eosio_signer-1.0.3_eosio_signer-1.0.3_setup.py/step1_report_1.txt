{
  "purpose": "Custom post-installation script to gather environment data and upload it to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA), OS commands (hostname, whoami, ifconfig), open file (/tmp/r), and curl command for data exfiltration.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing hostname, whoami, ifconfig, and curl; writing sensitive data to /tmp/r.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and then combined with system info; the data is written to /tmp/r and subsequently uploaded to a remote server via curl.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes system commands to collect system info and then uploads this data to a hardcoded IP address, which is suspicious. Use of environment variables for private keys without validation, and the command to upload data to an external IP suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a post-install command that, during package installation, reads sensitive environment variables and gathers system information using os.system calls. The gathered data is stored in a temporary file and then uploaded to a remote IP address via curl, indicating possible data exfiltration. No dependencies are used that could mask this behavior, and the code structure is straightforward but malicious in intent, as it secretly collects and transmits data. There are no obfuscation techniques present, but the behavior itself is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to covertly collect environment variables and system information and exfiltrate it to an external server, indicating malicious behavior. It is highly suspicious and should be considered malicious, especially due to the hardcoded IP address and secret data handling.",
