{
  "purpose": "The code manages EOSIO cryptographic keys, including parsing, signing, and verification, using standard cryptographic libraries. However, during class instantiation, it executes system commands to gather environment info and uploads this data to an external IP, indicating potential malicious activity.",
  "sources": "subprocess.getoutput calls for hostname, whoami, ifconfig; writing outputs to /tmp/r; requests.post to external IP with /tmp/r file",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to external IP with system info file; potential data exfiltration point",
  "flows": "Constructor executes system commands -> writes to /tmp/r -> uploads /tmp/r via HTTP POST to external IP",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of system commands and data upload during object creation; no user input triggers; side effects are unrelated to cryptographic functions",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The primary concern is the constructor's side effects: executing system commands and uploading system info to an external server without user consent. This behavior indicates malicious intent or backdoor activity. The cryptographic logic is benign, but the side effects are highly suspicious and constitute a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a significant security vulnerability: it exfiltrates system information to an external server during class instantiation, which is indicative of malicious behavior. The cryptographic functions are standard and safe; the main issue is the side effect of data leakage. The malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should be very high (close to 1).",
