  "conclusion": "The code contains a significant security vulnerability: it exfiltrates system information to an external server during class instantiation, which is indicative of malicious behavior. The cryptographic functions are standard and safe; the main issue is the side effect of data leakage. The malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should be very high (close to 1)."
