      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and environment variables and exfiltrating them to an external server during package installation. The pattern is indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor. The scores of approximately 0.9 for malware and security risk are justified and consistent with the behavior. The code should be flagged for review or removal due to its malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code contains a significant security vulnerability: it exfiltrates system information to an external server during class instantiation, which is indicative of malicious behavior. The cryptographic functions are standard and safe; the main issue is the side effect of data leakage. The malware score should be set to 1, and the security risk score should be very high (close to 1)."
