  "purpose": "Configure and setup the 'sccket' Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() function call, including package metadata and package discovery",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is sent over network, written to files, or executed dynamically",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; package name 'sccket' appears to be a misspelling of 'socket', but this alone is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools module and calls its setup() function to define package metadata, including name, version, author, description, and classifiers. The package name and description suggest it is related to HTTP middleware and requests authentication. No external inputs, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
