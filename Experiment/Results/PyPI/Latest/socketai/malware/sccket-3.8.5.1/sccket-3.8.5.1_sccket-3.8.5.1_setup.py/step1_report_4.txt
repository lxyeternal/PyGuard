  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'sccket' Python package, specifying metadata and package details.",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() call, setuptool's find_packages() function",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data sinks or untrusted data handling identified",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; standard package setup flow",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Package name 'sccket' could be a typo or intentionally misleading, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, description, packages, and classifiers. No input/output handling, data processing, or dynamic code execution present. The package name 'sccket' might be suspicious as a misspelling of 'socket', but this alone is not malicious. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package. No malicious activity, malicious code, or security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
