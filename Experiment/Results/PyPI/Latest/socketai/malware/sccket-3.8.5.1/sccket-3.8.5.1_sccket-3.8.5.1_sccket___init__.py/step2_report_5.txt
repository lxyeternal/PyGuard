  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippet, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .sccket import WiFi\n```\n\nThis is a straightforward relative import of `WiFi` from a module named `sccket`. The typo in the module name (likely intended to be `socket`) is consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import WiFi from `sccket`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the typo and finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.7, obfuscated 0.2, malware 0, securityRisk 0.\n  \n**Evaluation:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The typo is suspicious but could be innocent. The malware score of 0 is appropriate, given no malicious activity is evident. The security risk is also 0, which aligns with the code fragment.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Highlights the unusual module name and possible obfuscation, but no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.6, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.1.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent. The slight increase in securityRisk (0.1) accounts for suspicion due to the typo. Malware remains 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Same observations about the typo, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.6, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nAgain, consistent. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2) reflects the potential for obfuscation or typo-squatting, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same import.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning, emphasizes the typo could be malicious or accidental.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.6, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nAppropriate. No malicious activity detected, but the typo warrants further review.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion about the typo, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** confidence 0.6, obfuscated 0, malware 0, securityRisk 0.2.\n\n**Evaluation:**  \nConsistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet itself is benign; it’s a simple import statement.\n- **Typo in module name 'sccket':** The consistent misspelling of 'socket' could be accidental or an obfuscation tactic. Without additional context, it’s impossible to determine intent solely from this line.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate unless malicious code is embedded within the `sccket` module itself. Since we only see the import statement, no malware can be inferred here.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated due to the typo, but not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the evidence.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 unless further code or module analysis reveals malicious content.\n- The obfuscated score is low (0.2), which is acceptable; the typo could be accidental or deliberate obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final judgment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity in this fragment)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.2 (possible obfuscation, but not definitively)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to the typo, but not a serious security risk on its own)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports correctly identify the typo and assess the risk as minimal. No malicious activity is evident from this import statement alone. Further investigation into the `sccket` module is recommended, especially to verify if it’s a malicious substitute for `socket`.\n\n**Note:** The scores should stay as they are unless additional code or context indicates otherwise.",
