  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .sccket import WiFi\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement.\n- The module name `sccket` appears to be a typo of `socket`. This typo is consistent across all reports.\n- No runtime data, user input, or other suspicious operations are present.\n- The import statement itself is benign, but the misspelling raises questions about intent.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Import `WiFi` from `sccket`.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the typo and notes no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.2, confidence=0.7\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The low malware score aligns with the benign nature of the import. The obfuscation score accounts for the typo, which could be intentional obfuscation or simple typo.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning, emphasizing the unusual module name and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.6\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score due to the suspicious module name, which is appropriate. Malware remains zero.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Similar, noting the typo and the benign nature of import.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.6\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score, justified by the typo potentially indicating obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning, emphasizing the typo and benign import.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.6\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior assessments.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Similar, noting suspicion due to typo.\n- **Score:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.6\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign malware=0, as the code snippet does not perform any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Slightly elevated (0.2) in some reports due to the typo, which could be an obfuscation tactic.\n- **Security Risk:** Mostly low, but slightly higher (0.2) in some reports, considering the suspicious module name.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The typo in `sccket` is consistent and likely unintentional, but it could also be an obfuscation attempt or typo-squatting.\n- Since the code snippet is minimal, no malicious activity can be confirmed.\n- The scores are reasonable given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.2 (due to the typo, which could be obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (possible typo/obfuscation but no direct threat)\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nIf the `sccket` module is malicious or contains obfuscated code, that would elevate the malware score. But based solely on this import statement, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign import statement with a suspicious typo.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable.\n- Further investigation should focus on the actual `sccket` module content, not just this import line.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese are the scores I recommend based on the provided information.",
