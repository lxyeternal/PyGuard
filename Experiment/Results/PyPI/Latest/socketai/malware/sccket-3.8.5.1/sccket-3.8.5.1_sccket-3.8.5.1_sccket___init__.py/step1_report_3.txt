  "purpose": "Importing the WiFi class or object from a local module named sccket, likely related to WiFi functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .sccket",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows visible in this single line of code",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the module name 'sccket' instead of 'socket'; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a component named WiFi from a module that appears to be misspelled as 'sccket'. This could be a typo or intentional obfuscation. Without additional context, this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The import could be benign, but the misspelling warrants further review of the module contents. No other suspicious behavior is evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with a likely typographical error. It does not show any malicious activity or security risk by itself, but the misspelling suggests that further review of the module is necessary to confirm its safety.",
