  "purpose": "Importing the WiFi class or function from a local module named sccket.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only performs an import statement.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present as there is no execution beyond the import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable in this single line of code.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'sccket' is unusual and potentially misspelled; it might be an attempt to obfuscate or disguise malicious intent. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module named 'sccket' and accesses 'WiFi'. The misspelling could be innocuous or malicious, possibly an obfuscation tactic. Since the code only consists of an import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no evident malicious intent. The unusual module name warrants a closer look at the 'sccket' module itself, but based on this snippet alone, there is no malicious or security risk detected.",
