  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with the main concern being the suspicious module name 'sccket'. No evidence of malicious activity is present in this snippet. The low malware score is justified; the typo warrants further review. The risk and obfuscation scores are appropriate given the context. Overall, the import is likely harmless but should be verified by inspecting the 'sccket' module contents."
