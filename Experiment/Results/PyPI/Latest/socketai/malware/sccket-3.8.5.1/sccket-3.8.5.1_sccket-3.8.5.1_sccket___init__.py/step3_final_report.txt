{
  "purpose": "Import WiFi from a local module named 'sccket', which appears to be a misspelling of 'socket'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the code only imports a class from a module.",
  "flows": "Importing 'WiFi' from 'sccket' without further code; no data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'sccket' is misspelled, likely intended to be 'socket'. This consistent typo could be accidental or an obfuscation tactic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with a consistent typo in the module name. No malicious code or behavior is evident in this fragment. The typo raises suspicion but could be a benign mistake. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately low (0 and 0.2 respectively). The obfuscation score reflects the typo's potential to be intentional obfuscation. The confidence level is moderate, given the minimal context. Further investigation of the 'sccket' module is recommended to determine if it is malicious or benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with the main concern being the suspicious module name 'sccket'. No evidence of malicious activity is present in this snippet. The low malware score is justified; the typo warrants further review. The risk and obfuscation scores are appropriate given the context. Overall, the import is likely harmless but should be verified by inspecting the 'sccket' module contents.",
