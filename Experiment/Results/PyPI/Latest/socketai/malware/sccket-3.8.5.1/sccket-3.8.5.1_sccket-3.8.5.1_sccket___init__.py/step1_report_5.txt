  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow identified in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in module name 'sccket' instead of 'socket'. This could be accidental or malicious (e.g., to mimic legitimate modules).",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'WiFi' from a local module named 'sccket'. The misspelling suggests either a typo or an obfuscation attempt. The import itself is standard; however, the unusual module name raises suspicion about possible malicious intent or attempts to hide functionality. Since the code is minimal, no malicious behavior can be confirmed, but the typo warrants further review of the actual 'sccket' module for malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with a suspicious misspelling of a standard module ('socket'). The typo could be accidental or malicious. No direct malicious behavior is evident in this line alone, but further investigation of the 'sccket' module is recommended.",
