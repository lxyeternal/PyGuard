  "purpose": "Import the WiFi class or function from a local module named sccket.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module sccket during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from sccket module, no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in module name 'sccket' instead of 'socket' may indicate obfuscation or typo; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or function named WiFi from a module with a misspelled name 'sccket'. This could be a simple typo or intentional obfuscation. Since it is a straightforward import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior in this line alone. The code does not include any runtime data handling, user input, or suspicious operations. Without additional context or code, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with a likely typo in the module name. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
