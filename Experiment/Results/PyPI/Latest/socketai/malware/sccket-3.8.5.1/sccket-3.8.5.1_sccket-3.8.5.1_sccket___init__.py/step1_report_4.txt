  "purpose": "Importing the WiFi class or module from a relative package named 'sccket'.",
  "sources": "Reading the local module 'sccket' and its WiFi attribute.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads 'sccket' module, then accesses 'WiFi' class or object.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in module name 'sccket' could be accidental or malicious typo-squatting; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local or package-relative module 'sccket'. The misspelling of 'socket' as 'sccket' may be unintentional or deliberate. No further logic or code is provided that could indicate malicious behavior. The import itself does not perform any malicious activity. Without additional context, the code appears benign but warrants checking the 'sccket' module for malicious behavior if this is a typo or an intentional obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with a possible typo in the module name. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code in this fragment, but the typo warrants review of the 'sccket' module for potential malicious content.",
