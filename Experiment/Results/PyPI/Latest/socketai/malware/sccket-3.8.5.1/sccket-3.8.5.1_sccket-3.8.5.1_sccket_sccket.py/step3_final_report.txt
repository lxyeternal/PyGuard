{
  "purpose": "The code scans the current directory for non-zip files, collects system hostname and IP address, and exfiltrates the files and system info via Telegram API using hardcoded credentials, indicating covert data theft.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the current directory, obtaining hostname and IP via socket, reading files for upload",
  "sinks": "Requests to Telegram API endpoints for sending messages and documents, opening files for upload",
  "flows": "Directory scan -> file collection -> file upload via requests.post -> system info collection -> info message sent via requests.post",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive function names (unknown2, unknown4, etc.), hardcoded Telegram token and chat ID, automatic collection and exfiltration of files and system info without user consent",
  "analysis": "The script walks the current directory, excluding zip files, and uploads each file as a document to a Telegram chat. It also gathers hostname and IP address and sends this info as a message. The functions are ambiguously named, possibly to obfuscate intent. The code exfiltrates data silently, indicating malicious or covert behavior. No destructive actions are present, but the behavior aligns with data theft malware. The hardcoded credentials and automated exfiltration are significant security concerns. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation beyond non-descriptive function names, and the data flows are direct from source (file/system info) to sink (Telegram API).",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration tool, collecting files and system info and sending them via Telegram using hardcoded credentials. Its behavior is malicious, designed for stealthy data theft. The scores reflect high malware likelihood and security risk, justified by the exfiltration activity and hardcoded secrets.",
