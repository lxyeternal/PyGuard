{
  "purpose": "The code searches for files in the current directory and its subdirectories, then uploads those files and system information (hostname and IP address) to a Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "Reading files from the filesystem (os.walk, open), reading system hostname and IP (socket.gethostname, socket.gethostbyname), reading the bot token and chat ID (hardcoded strings).",
  "sinks": "Sending messages and files via Telegram API endpoints using HTTP POST requests with requests.post.",
  "flows": "Filesystem files -> send_to_telegram and unknown6 functions; hostname/IP -> unknown5 -> Telegram API; data flows from filesystem/system info to external Telegram server.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, which are sensitive credentials stored in plain text. The code unconditionally uploads all files (except '.zip') from current directory to Telegram, potentially exposing sensitive data. The function names are non-descriptive, suggesting obfuscation or intentional concealment. No user input is used, but the code is designed to exfiltrate files and system info automatically.",
  "analysis": "The script collects filenames in the current directory excluding zip files, then uploads each file to a Telegram chat using a bot token and chat ID hardcoded in the script. It also gathers hostname and IP address and sends this info as a message. The process is automated, with no user interaction. The use of hardcoded credentials and the automatic exfiltration of files indicate malicious intent, especially since it can leak sensitive data. The code does not contain obfuscated language features but employs functions with vague names, possibly to avoid easy detection. The data exfiltration is direct via Telegram, which is a common method for malware to communicate with command-and-control servers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be malicious or at least maliciously intended, as it systematically exfiltrates files and system info to an external service without user consent, using hardcoded credentials. This strongly suggests a supply chain security risk if such a package were maliciously inserted into a larger project or distributed on PyPI. The code is straightforward but exhibits behaviors characteristic of malware designed for data theft.",
