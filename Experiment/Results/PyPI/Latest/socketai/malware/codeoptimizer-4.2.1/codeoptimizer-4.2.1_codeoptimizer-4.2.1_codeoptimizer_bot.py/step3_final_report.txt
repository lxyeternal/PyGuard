  "purpose": "A Telegram bot providing extensive remote control capabilities, including executing system commands, extracting sensitive data (WiFi passwords, browser passwords, cookies), taking screenshots, recording the screen, listing files, and controlling system power (shutdown/restart). It uses hardcoded credentials for full control without validation.",
  "sources": "System commands (run_command), filesystem (os.path, os.listdir), environment variables (os.getenv), user input via Telegram commands, decryption functions accessing browser data, and Windows APIs (win32crypt, Cryptodome).",
  "sinks": "Sending data/files via Telegram (bot.send_photo, bot.send_document, send_long_message), executing system commands (subprocess.run), system control commands (shutdown), file access (open), and network connections (via subprocess commands).",
  "flows": "User commands trigger data collection (passwords, cookies, WiFi info), command execution, or system control; data is exfiltrated via Telegram; decryption functions process stored credentials; screen capture and recordings are sent back; file navigation allows access to local files.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram token and user ID, extensive data extraction functions without validation, no user consent, direct decryption of stored credentials, no obfuscation, straightforward code structure, functions decrypt stored passwords and cookies using Windows APIs, and no validation or authentication mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a malicious remote access trojan (RAT), capable of full system control, data theft, and surveillance. It accesses and decrypts sensitive user data, executes arbitrary commands, and exfiltrates information via Telegram. The presence of hardcoded credentials, direct decryption functions, and system control features confirm malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and operates with high privileges. These capabilities align with known malware behaviors, justifying high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a highly malicious RAT designed for covert surveillance, data theft, and system control. It contains no legitimate purpose and poses a severe security threat. The functions for extracting passwords, cookies, and WiFi credentials, combined with remote command execution and system manipulation, confirm its malicious nature. The hardcoded credentials and lack of validation further exacerbate its threat level.",
