  "purpose": "To evaluate the supply chain security of the given Python code snippet, identifying potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the code itself, especially functions, variables, and external data reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, environment variable access, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or external systems).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code appears standard with no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious indicators. No hardcoded secrets or insecure practices are evident. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or data leaks detected. Given the absence of suspicious behavior, the malware likelihood is negligible. The security risk is minimal, consistent with low-impact data processing code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the code's simplicity and lack of anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risks. The confidence level is high, around 0.9.",
