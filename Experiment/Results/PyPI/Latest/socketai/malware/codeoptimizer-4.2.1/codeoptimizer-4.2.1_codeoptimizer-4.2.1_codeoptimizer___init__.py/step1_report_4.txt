  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard data processing or functionality as intended by the package, with no obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data could come from user inputs, environment variables, or function arguments, but no explicit sources are clearly identifiable as untrusted in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly visible or directly executed with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through functions or variables to sinks like output or external communication, but no explicit source-to-sink pathways are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard constructs and library functions without obfuscation or anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python syntax, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. There are no indications of data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious external connections. Usage of libraries appears typical, and no hidden backdoors or encrypted segments are detected. The code structure is straightforward and lacks unusual behavior or secretive operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious flows. The confidence level in this assessment is high, and the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
