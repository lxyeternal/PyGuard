  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'codeoptimizer', including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "The script reads package information, dependencies, and a README file.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data handling or user input processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A - The script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; no hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It specifies dependencies, entry points, author info, and package metadata. The dependencies include common packages used for system automation, image processing, cryptography, and Telegram bot creation. There are no indications of obfuscated code, malicious imports, or hidden behavior. The long_description reads a README.md file, which is typical in setup scripts. No code execution or data flow that could be malicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate configuration file for packaging a Python project named 'codeoptimizer'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
