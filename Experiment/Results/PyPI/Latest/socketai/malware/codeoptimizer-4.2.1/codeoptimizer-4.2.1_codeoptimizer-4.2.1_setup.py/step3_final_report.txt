  "purpose": "Package configuration for the 'codeoptimizer' Telegram bot, defining dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Dependencies listed in 'install_requires'; entry point 'codeoptimizer.bot:run_bot'.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data handling or untrusted data flows; no sinks present in setup script.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the script only sets metadata and dependencies, with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with common dependencies and no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies dependencies related to automation, image processing, cryptography, and Telegram bot functionality. The entry point references a function 'run_bot' in the 'codeoptimizer.bot' module, but its implementation is not included, so behavior cannot be assessed. No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The dependencies are legitimate and common for such applications. The script does not perform any runtime actions or data handling, minimizing security concerns. Given the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be very low, around 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk in package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The dependencies and structure are standard, and the entry point does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, supply chain risk is minimal.",
