  "flows": "system info (hostname, username) -> base64 encoding -> command injection via os.popen() -> DNS query to suspicious domain",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() to execute a network request based on encoded system data; dynamic command execution with base64 encoding; DNS query to a suspicious domain (tnclzdakriptzmhikqzyjbi9hzhnt0ord.oast.fun)",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, upon installation, retrieves system hostname and username. It constructs a string with this info, encodes it in base64, and executes a DNS lookup command targeting a suspicious domain. The DNS query appears designed to exfiltrate data or perform covert communication. The use of os.popen() for executing system commands based on system data is suspicious. The domain used is unusual and potentially malicious. The code does not sanitize or validate data, indicating potential malicious intent to leak information or establish command and control communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates malicious behavior by collecting system information, encoding it, and performing a DNS query to a suspicious domain, likely for data exfiltration or C2 communication. It leverages installation hooks to run this behavior, which could be hidden or malicious in a supply chain context.",
