  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to perform a network lookup based on system information during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "os.popen() executing nslookup command with base64-encoded data",
  "flows": "Collect hostname and username -> encode data in base64 -> embed in nslookup command -> execute network request",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen with dynamic command construction, base64 encoding of system data for network request, no clear purpose for the nslookup call beyond data exfiltration",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, upon installation, gathers system hostname and username, encodes this information in base64, and performs a network lookup to a suspicious domain using the encoded data. The use of os.popen with a dynamically constructed command that includes encoded system info suggests an attempt to exfiltrate or probe network infrastructure stealthily. The domain used appears to be potentially malicious or at least suspicious, possibly serving as a command-and-control or data collection endpoint. The code does not perform any other malicious activities, but the network call itself is concerning, especially since the data is encoded and sent during installation without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior by collecting system data and sending it via a network request during installation, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious command execution. While no explicit malware like data theft or system damage is evident, the behavior is suspicious and warrants further investigation.",
