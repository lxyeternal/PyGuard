  "purpose": "Custom installation process that performs a network lookup involving system and user information during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "os.popen() executing nslookup with base64-encoded data",
  "flows": "Collect hostname and username -> encode data -> execute nslookup with encoded data in command line",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding to obfuscate data sent in network request; running a system command during install; no clear documentation or purpose for the DNS query.",
  "analysis": "The code extends the setuptools installation process to perform an additional step after standard install. It gathers the system hostname and current user, encodes this data in base64, and then performs a DNS lookup with a domain name that includes this encoded data. The use of os.popen to execute a command involving a DNS query with potentially user and system info encoded in the domain name is suspicious, as it could be used for data exfiltration or tracking. The code does not appear to have a legitimate purpose related to package installation, and the obfuscation via base64 adds to suspicion. No other malicious actions, such as data theft, reverse shells, or malware deployment, are present, but the behavior suggests potential privacy violation or covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an unusual network request during package installation that encodes system and user info, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration purposes. This behavior is suspicious and warrants caution. No explicit malware, but the intent appears potentially malicious or privacy-invasive.",
