      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-probability malicious behavior, specifically covert data exfiltration via DNS queries containing encoded system info. The behavior is consistent with malicious supply chain activity. The malware score should be set at 0.75, reflecting high likelihood of malicious intent. Obfuscation is minimal, so the obfuscated score should be around 0.1. The overall security risk is high, approximately 0.75, due to privacy and covert communication concerns."
