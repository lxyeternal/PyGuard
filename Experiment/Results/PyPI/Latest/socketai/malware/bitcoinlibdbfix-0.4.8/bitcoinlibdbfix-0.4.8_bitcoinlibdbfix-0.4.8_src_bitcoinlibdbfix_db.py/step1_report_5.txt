  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for collecting and sending system information, including geolocation, and files to various messaging platforms (Telegram, Discord) and a custom API endpoint. It functions as a multi-platform data sender, possibly for monitoring or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Requests to external services (IP geolocation API), reading files from specified directories, reading file contents for encoding, environment variables for tokens and URLs.",
  "sinks": "POST requests to Telegram, Discord, and custom API endpoints with data and files, including base64-encoded file data and message content.",
  "flows": "Source: get_ip_geo_info() fetches IP data; file reading in send_to_* functions encodes data; data is then sent via POST requests to external endpoints (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded sensitive tokens and URLs (Telegram token, Discord webhook, API endpoint). Sending system IP info and files to external services without any validation or user consent. No apparent validation or sanitization of data. The code combines multiple communication channels in a potentially automated manner.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for sending system information, files, and messages to multiple external services. It hardcodes tokens, chat IDs, webhook URLs, and API endpoints, which are typical in malicious exfiltration scripts. The methods encode files in base64 and send large files, potentially for data theft. The process includes collecting IP geolocation, which can be used for profiling. The code does not include user prompts, input validation, or consent mechanisms, indicating possible malicious intent. The flow from reading local files to transmitting them externally is straightforward and unprotected, increasing the risk of data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to collect system IP information and files, then send this data to external messaging platforms and a custom API. The hardcoded credentials and direct data transmission without user interaction suggest malicious intent, likely for data theft or unauthorized surveillance. It does not contain obfuscation but has clear malicious potential based on its behavior.",
