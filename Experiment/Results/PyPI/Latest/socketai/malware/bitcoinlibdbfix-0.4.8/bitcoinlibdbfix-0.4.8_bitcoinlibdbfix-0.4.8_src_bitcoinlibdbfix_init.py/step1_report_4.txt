{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package's __init__.py file, designed to expose certain components and run pre-install checks.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules (.cli, .version, .installer) during import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Importing modules, executing run_pre_install if available during import.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable behavior is the conditional import and execution of run_pre_install, which is standard for setup checks. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports main components and version info, then attempts to run a pre-install function if available. The try-except block ensures that failure to import or run pre-install does not break the package. This pattern is typical for setup or installation routines. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script that conditionally runs pre-install checks. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
