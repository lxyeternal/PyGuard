  "purpose": "The code defines module exports and attempts to run a pre-install check during import if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for main, __version__, and run_pre_install; the call to run_pre_install() inside try block.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as there are no untrusted data flows or external effects beyond the optional pre-install check.",
  "flows": "Import of run_pre_install (source) → execution of run_pre_install (sink) if import succeeds.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install during import is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports core components and attempts to execute run_pre_install if available, likely for setup validation. This is a standard pattern in package installation workflows. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The try-except block safely handles missing modules without revealing sensitive data. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard module initialization with a conditional pre-install hook. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. The only notable aspect is the automatic pre-install check, which is a common pattern. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
