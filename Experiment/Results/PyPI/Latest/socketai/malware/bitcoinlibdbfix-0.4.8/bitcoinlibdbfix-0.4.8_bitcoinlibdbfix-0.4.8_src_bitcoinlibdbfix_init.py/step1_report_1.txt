{
  "purpose": "Defines module exports, imports core functions, and attempts to run pre-install checks during installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for cli, version, and installer modules; call to run_pre_install() within try block.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; run_pre_install() is called if available, but no data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional execution of run_pre_install() during import could potentially execute code during installation, but this is a common pattern for setup routines. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module exports and attempts to run a pre-installation function if available, catching ImportError to avoid failures. The run_pre_install() function's purpose is likely to perform setup tasks, not malicious activity. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. No untrusted data sources or sinks are present, and no anomalies indicating malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module performs standard setup and export tasks with a benign pattern for pre-install checks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code.",
