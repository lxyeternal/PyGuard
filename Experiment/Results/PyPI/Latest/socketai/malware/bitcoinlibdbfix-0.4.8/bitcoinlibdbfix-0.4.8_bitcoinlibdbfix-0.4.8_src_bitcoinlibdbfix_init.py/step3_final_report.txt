  "flows": "Import triggers run_pre_install if present, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Execution of external function during module import, which is a common but potentially risky pattern",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, managing exports and attempting to run a setup function if available. No untrusted data, network activity, or malicious payloads are evident. The pattern of executing run_pre_install during import is typical for setup routines but could pose a risk if the function is malicious. The code is not obfuscated, and no suspicious behavior is detected. The risk primarily hinges on the contents of run_pre_install, which is external and unknown. Given the lack of evidence of malicious intent, the overall assessment is that the code is benign, with a minimal inherent risk due to external code execution during import.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup pattern with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight risk score of 0.1 accounts for the potential danger if run_pre_install is malicious, but in the absence of evidence, it remains low. Overall, the supply chain component appears safe.",
