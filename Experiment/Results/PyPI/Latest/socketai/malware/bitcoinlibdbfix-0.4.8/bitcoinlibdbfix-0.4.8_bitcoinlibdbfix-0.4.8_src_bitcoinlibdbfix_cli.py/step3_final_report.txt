  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for managing a Bitcoin wallet, including importing transactions, private keys, creating new wallets, and handling sensitive data inputs. It detects whether arguments are file paths or text and transmits data or notifications via external database functions.",
  "sources": "Input arguments such as 'import_tx_file', 'import_tx', 'import_private', 'password', 'passphrase', and 'database'; file existence checks; error handling functions that read directory files.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'self.db.send_to_all' with file paths or text content; 'send_directory_files' transmitting directory contents; error handling transmitting directory files; potential network or log transmission of sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are validated for file paths; file contents or text are sent to 'send_to_all' or 'send_directory_files'; sensitive data (passwords, private keys, passphrases) are transmitted unencrypted; error handling transmits directory files; heuristics attempt to detect encrypted data but are unreliable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heuristic 'len(arg_value) > 20' to identify encrypted content; transmission of sensitive data (passwords, private keys, passphrases) via 'send_to_all' without encryption; error handling transmitting entire directory files; no validation or encryption of sensitive data; potential data leakage.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a CLI for wallet management, parsing arguments, and transmitting data via external functions. It detects file paths to send file contents, and for text inputs, it transmits the data directly or flags likely encrypted content based on length heuristic. Sensitive data such as passwords and private keys are sent without encryption, which poses privacy and security risks. Error handling involves transmitting directory files, which could leak sensitive information if misused. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident. The functions 'send_to_all' and 'send_directory_files' are external; their implementation determines whether data is transmitted securely or exfiltrated. The heuristic for encrypted data detection is weak but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code's main concern is insecure handling and transmission of sensitive data, not active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but exhibits insecure handling of sensitive data, transmitting passwords, private keys, and passphrases without encryption or safeguards. This behavior could lead to data leaks or privacy violations if the external functions transmit data over untrusted channels. The malware score should be low (around 0.1), but the security risk is high (around 0.7) due to potential data leakage. No active malicious payloads are detected, but the handling practices are risky and warrant caution.",
