{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python module that imports libraries and performs some data processing or utility functions. There is no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules. No explicit external input sources such as network or files are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing output, writing to files, or network communications if present. No explicit malicious sinks such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network connections are identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., parameters or environment variables) through processing functions, ending at output statements or return values. No suspicious or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code includes standard library imports, variable definitions, and function definitions with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns. No use of dynamic code execution, suspicious network calls, or system modifications is present. The logic is typical of utility or processing scripts. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, this code shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script without harmful features.",
