  "purpose": "Manage Bitcoin wallets: create, list, generate keys, import transactions, and send transactions using the bitcoinlib library.",
  "sources": "User input arguments, external JSON transaction files, internal functions generating passphrases and keys.",
  "sinks": "Console output of sensitive data (passphrases, keys), transaction broadcasting via library calls, file reading of transaction data.",
  "flows": "Input arguments and files provide data to wallet creation, key generation, and transaction import functions; data flows into wallet methods; outputs are printed or sent over network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Sensitive data is generated internally and printed, which is typical for development but should be handled carefully in production.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard wallet management functions with proper use of the bitcoinlib library. It handles sensitive data responsibly, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network abuse, or obfuscation. Transaction data is read from external files, which could be risky if untrusted, but this is common in wallet tools. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present. The functions are straightforward, and the overall structure indicates a benign, well-implemented utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Bitcoin wallet management script with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low at 0.2, reflecting standard operational risks without malicious implications.",
