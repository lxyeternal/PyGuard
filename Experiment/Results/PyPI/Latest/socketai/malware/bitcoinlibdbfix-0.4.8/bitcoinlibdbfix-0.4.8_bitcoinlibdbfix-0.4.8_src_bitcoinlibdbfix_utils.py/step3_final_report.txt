  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external files, network interactions, API calls.",

  "flows": "Sources feeding into data processing, which then influence network, file, or system sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, complex code structures, dynamic execution, potential hidden logic, absence of hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently identify that the code is primarily routine data processing with no explicit malicious activity. Reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 correctly assign low malware and obfuscation scores, reflecting benign behavior. Report 4 notes obfuscation and complexity, which warrants cautious scoring. The malware scores in Report 4 are somewhat conservative; given the signs of obfuscation, a higher malware score (e.g., 0.4) would better represent potential hidden risks. The security risk scores are low across all reports, aligning with the absence of concrete vulnerabilities. The confidence levels are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound throughout.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that the code is unlikely malicious, with obfuscation in one report justifying a moderate concern. The scores are generally appropriate; increasing the malware score in Report 4 to reflect obfuscation would improve accuracy. No significant discrepancies are observed, and the reasoning aligns with the evidence.",
