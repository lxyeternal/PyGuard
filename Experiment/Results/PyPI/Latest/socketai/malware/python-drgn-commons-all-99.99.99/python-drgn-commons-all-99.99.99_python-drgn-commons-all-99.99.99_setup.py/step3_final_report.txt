{
  "purpose": "The code collects system and user information during package installation and exfiltrates it to an external Slack webhook URL without user consent, indicating malicious data theft activity.",
  "sources": "Execution of system commands via os.popen() and os.system() to gather OS details, hostname, username, IP addresses, and current directory during install.",
  "sinks": "The constructed data payload is sent via a curl command executed through os.system() to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, transmitting sensitive information externally.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info, user info) are gathered through os.popen() and os.system(); the data is formatted into JSON and transmitted via an external HTTP POST request to the webhook URL, constituting a source-to-sink flow of sensitive data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data collection and exfiltration during package installation without user notification or consent; use of hardcoded webhook URL; straightforward code with no obfuscation; collection of sensitive info such as hostname, username, IP addresses, and system details.",
  "analysis": "The code executes platform-specific commands to gather sensitive system and user information during installation. It constructs a JSON payload with this data and transmits it via a curl command to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, all within the install process. The use of os.popen() and os.system() for data collection and transmission, combined with the absence of user consent, indicates malicious intent. The data exfiltration occurs unconditionally, making it a covert activity akin to spyware or backdoor behavior. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, and the exfiltration of sensitive data during installation is a serious security violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent through automatic, unconsented collection and external transmission of sensitive system and user information during package installation. The activity aligns with malicious backdoors or spyware, warranting maximum malware and security risk scores. The code should be flagged as malicious, and its use avoided.",
