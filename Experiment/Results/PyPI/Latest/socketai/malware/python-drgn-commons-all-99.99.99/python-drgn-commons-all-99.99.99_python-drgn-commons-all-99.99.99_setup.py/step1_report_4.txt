  "purpose": "Custom installation script that collects system information and sends it via a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls to execute system commands and retrieve system info; os.system() to send HTTP POST request with collected data.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call executing a curl command that posts data to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info collected via os.popen() calls flows into a formatted JSON payload which is then sent via os.system() to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of system commands to gather detailed system info (hostname, user, IP, OS details) during package installation; sending this data to an external webhook without any apparent user consent or control.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the 'install' command from setuptools, executing system commands based on platform to gather detailed system information. This info is then formatted into a JSON string and transmitted to a Slack webhook URL via a curl command embedded in os.system(). This behavior is atypical for a standard package install script and indicates possible malicious intent to exfiltrate system information. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of sensitive data such as hostname, username, and system configuration during install are suspicious and potentially malicious. No input validation or user prompts are present. The code does not perform any meaningful installation logic related to the package itself, focusing solely on data collection and exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system information during installation and exfiltrating it to an external service without user consent. This suggests a deliberate attempt to spy or gather system data surreptitiously. Given these actions, the code should be considered malicious with high confidence.",
