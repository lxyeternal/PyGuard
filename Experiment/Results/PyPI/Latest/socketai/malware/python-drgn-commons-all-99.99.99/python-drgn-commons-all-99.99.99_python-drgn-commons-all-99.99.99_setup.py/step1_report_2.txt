  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (uname, hostname, whoami), executing shell commands (curl, ipconfig, systeminfo), and getting current directory.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via an HTTP POST request to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info and user details are gathered and then sent to the external URL, potentially leaking system data.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration during install, use of os.popen and os.system for gathering and transmitting data, hardcoded webhook URL, no input validation, unusual behavior for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command to run custom code during package installation. It collects system information such as OS details, IP addresses, hostname, current user, and current directory. It then constructs a JSON payload with this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a specified Slack webhook URL. This behavior is suspicious because it exfiltrates potentially sensitive system data without user consent, during an install process. The use of os.popen and os.system suggests command execution that could be manipulated or could leak sensitive info. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating intentional data exfiltration rather than benign diagnostics. No validation, encryption, or safeguards are present, and this behavior is hidden within the package installation routine.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive system information and exfiltrating it to an external server during installation. This behavior is hidden inside a custom setup command, indicating an intent to spy on or steal user system data. The overall security risk is high due to the data exfiltration and untrusted external communication.",
