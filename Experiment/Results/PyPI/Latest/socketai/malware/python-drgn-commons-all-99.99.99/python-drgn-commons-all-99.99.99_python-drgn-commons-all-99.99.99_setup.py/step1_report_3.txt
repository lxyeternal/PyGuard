  "purpose": "Customize installation process to gather system information and send it via a webhook.",
  "sources": "os.popen() calls for 'uname', 'ifconfig', 'curl', 'whoami', 'hostname', and 'systeminfo'; os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "os.system() call that executes a curl command sending data to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system commands (sources) flows into the os.system() call (sink) which transmits information externally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.popen() for command execution, especially commands that retrieve system info and public IP; concatenation of untrusted data into shell command without sanitization; sending detailed system info to an external webhook without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute additional steps during package installation. It collects system information, user info, and network details using os.popen() calls across different platforms. The collected data includes system configuration, hostname, user identity, and public IP address. It then constructs a JSON payload containing this info and sends it via an external webhook URL using os.system(). This behavior can be considered suspicious because it collects sensitive system data and transmits it without explicit user consent, potentially for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The use of os.popen() and os.system() with concatenated data presents security risks, such as command injection if input is maliciously crafted, though in this context, data is internally generated. No hardcoded credentials are present, but the behavior of data exfiltration is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system information collection and sends it externally via a webhook during package installation. This could be malicious or at least invasive, especially if used without user knowledge. It does not contain obvious malware like reverse shells or data theft, but the privacy-invasive behavior and external data transmission pose security concerns.",
