  "purpose": "Custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to a Slack webhook during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (uname, systeminfo, ipconfig), user data (whoami, hostname), current working directory, and executing shell commands via os.popen and os.system.",
  "sinks": "Sending collected data via HTTP POST request to an external Slack webhook URL.",
  "flows": "System info and user data are collected through os.popen and os.system calls; then this data is embedded into a JSON payload and sent over the network to an external URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively gathers sensitive system details and user info and transmits them without user consent. The Slack webhook URL is hardcoded and publicly visible in the code, indicating potential data exfiltration. Use of os.popen and os.system for executing shell commands may be unsafe if input is manipulated, but here it appears static. The code's primary suspicious behavior is the automated collection and transmission of environment data during package installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that, during installation, executes commands to gather system information such as OS details, IP configuration, current user, hostname, and a public IP address. It then constructs a message containing this info and sends it via a POST request to a specific Slack webhook URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, as it collects potentially sensitive environment data and transmits it to an external server without any user awareness. The use of hardcoded webhook URL and the collection of system details during installation are typical indicators of malicious or at least suspicious activity, potentially for tracking or covert data collection purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting detailed system and user information and sending it to an external service during package installation. The presence of hardcoded webhook URL and data exfiltration activity points toward malicious intent or a backdoor mechanism. Although technically the code is straightforward, its purpose raises security concerns, especially if installed unknowingly.",
