      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup poses a notable security risk, especially if main.py contains malicious code. The current reports' assessments are appropriate, but the risk should be considered high. The pattern itself warrants caution, and the package should be scrutinized further before use."

The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the code should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious."
