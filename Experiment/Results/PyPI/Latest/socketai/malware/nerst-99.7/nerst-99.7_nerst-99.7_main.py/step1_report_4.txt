  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to external URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP requests to external URLs with collected data as query parameters using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, path, random number) flows from source variables into URL parameters, which are then transmitted over the network via urlopen.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded URLs that appear suspicious or malicious. The URLs are obfuscated with random subdomains and use non-standard domains, indicating possible malicious command and control or data collection endpoints. The code unconditionally sends data to these URLs, with no user consent or validation.",
  "analysis": "The script collects basic system information—hostname, username, current directory—and generates a random number. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending the data as URL parameters. The data is transmitted via HTTP GET requests without encryption or user approval. The URLs are potentially malicious, designed for tracking or exfiltration. The code does not perform any validation or sanitization, and the use of external endpoints indicates malicious intent or at least highly suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious or intended for malicious purposes, as it stealthily transmits system info to suspicious external servers without user consent. The URL patterns and data collection behavior are typical of malware or malicious tracking scripts.",
