  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple remote URLs with a random identifier.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests with collected data as URL parameters to external servers using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, path, rd_num) -> Constructs URL with these parameters -> Sends HTTP request to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains; data collection and transmission without user consent; no clear benign purpose. No validation or sanitization of data. The URLs seem obfuscated or maliciously crafted. The code attempts to send system info to third-party servers, which can be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code collects system hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then sends this data via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs. The URLs are suspicious and potentially malicious, possibly used for tracking or data exfiltration. The code executes network requests without any user notification or permission checks. No benign explanation is evident; this pattern is typical in malware or malicious telemetry. There are no obfuscation techniques but the behavior of stealthily transmitting system info is suspicious. The code appears to be designed to gather environment info and send it to third-party servers, which poses security and privacy concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious intent by collecting system information and transmitting it to suspicious external servers without user consent. It may be part of a tracking, surveillance, or data exfiltration operation. The behavior is suspicious, and the URLs indicate potential malicious activity.",
