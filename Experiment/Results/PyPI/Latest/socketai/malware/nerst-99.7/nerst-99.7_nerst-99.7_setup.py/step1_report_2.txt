{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'nerst' package, including a custom install step that executes code from 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' and executes 'main()' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' can execute arbitrary code, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method executes, importing 'main' from 'main' and calling 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat' runs code during installation, which is unconventional and potentially risky.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, upon running, imports and executes 'main()' from an external module 'main'. This behavior could execute arbitrary code during package installation, which is suspicious. The rest of the setup is standard, specifying package info and dependencies. The malicious potential depends on what 'main()' does, but executing code during install without clear necessity is a red flag. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. The main concern is the arbitrary code execution triggered during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes a custom installation step that executes 'main()' during install, which could be malicious if 'main()' contains harmful code. This behavior is unconventional and warrants caution, as it allows code execution at install time. The package could be used to run malicious code silently during setup.",
