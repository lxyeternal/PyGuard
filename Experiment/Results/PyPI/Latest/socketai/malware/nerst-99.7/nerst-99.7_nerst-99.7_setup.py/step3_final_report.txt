{
  "purpose": "The code executes a custom installation step that imports and runs main() from main.py during package installation, which can be exploited for malicious activity.",
  "sources": "The run() method in CrazyInstallStrat class, specifically the import and execution of main() from main.py after standard install.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() during install acts as a sink where untrusted or malicious code can be executed, potentially leading to system compromise.",
  "flows": "The source is the run() method; the sink is the call to main() which executes code from main.py during installation.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of external code (main()) during setup, which is unconventional and risky; no obfuscation or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that, after completing standard installation, imports and executes main() from main.py. This pattern allows arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is a significant security concern. The code is clear and lacks obfuscation. The risk depends on the content of main.py; if malicious, it could perform harmful actions. The scores in the reports range from 0.25 to 0.5 for malware and 0.45 to 0.7 for security risk, which are reasonable but conservative. Given the pattern, a malware score of around 0.5 and a security risk score of approximately 0.6 are justified, reflecting the potential for malicious code execution during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing main() during setup poses a notable security risk, especially if main.py contains malicious code. The current reports' assessments are appropriate, but the risk should be considered high. The pattern itself warrants caution, and the package should be scrutinized further before use.",
