  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a straightforward import statement of `enable_other_autostart_feature` from a local module `autostart`, aliased as `load`.\n- The code snippet is minimal, with no execution, data flow, or suspicious patterns visible.\n- The primary concern is the function's name and potential for misuse, not actual malicious activity in the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just an import statement with no execution or data flow.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious activity is present in the code snippet itself.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Potential for misuse:** The function name suggests autostart or persistence features, which could be misused, but no actual evidence here.\n\n---\n\n### Issues in the reports:\n- The reports tend to overemphasize potential risks based solely on the function name and purpose, without concrete evidence.\n- The scoring for `malware` is uniformly 0, which aligns with the analysis; however, some reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0.1 or 0.2, which seems somewhat arbitrary given the minimal code.\n- The confidence levels vary but generally are appropriate given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 across all reports; no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the potential implications of autostart features but is somewhat conservative.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nGiven the minimal code, the scores are reasonable. However, the risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 across the board, as there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws and reasoning:\n- The reports are consistent and cautious, emphasizing the need to review the implementation of `enable_other_autostart_feature` before making definitive security claims.\n- No false claims or unwarranted assumptions are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.1 (more appropriate than 0.2, given no evidence)\n\n- **Justification for risk score:**  \n  While the function name suggests potentially sensitive behavior, the code snippet itself does not perform any action. The risk stems from the imported function's implementation, which is unknown. Therefore, a low risk score is justified unless further context indicates malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign in isolation.\n- The reports are cautious but somewhat overstate potential risks based solely on naming.\n- The scores are generally appropriate; I recommend lowering the `securityRisk` to 0.1 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nProceed with further review of the `autostart` module implementation before concluding on security implications.",
