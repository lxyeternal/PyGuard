{
  "purpose": "Import a function named 'enable_other_autostart_feature' from a local module 'autostart' and alias it as 'load'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module within the package.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'load' function, depending on its implementation, could be a sink if it executes code or modifies system settings.",
  "flows": "The code imports a function; actual execution depends on whether 'load()' is called elsewhere in the package.",
  "anomalies": "The import itself appears straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are present. The function name 'enable_other_autostart_feature' suggests system-level modifications, which could be benign or malicious depending on context.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a specific function from a local module. It does not perform any actions or contain logic that could be malicious by itself. The function's name indicates it may modify autostart settings, which could be used for legitimate purposes or for persistent malware. Without seeing the implementation of 'enable_other_autostart_feature', it is not possible to determine if it is malicious. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no immediate malicious activity. The potential security concern lies in the implementation of the imported function, which is not provided. Based solely on this code, there is low suspicion but a need to review the 'autostart' module for malicious behavior.",
