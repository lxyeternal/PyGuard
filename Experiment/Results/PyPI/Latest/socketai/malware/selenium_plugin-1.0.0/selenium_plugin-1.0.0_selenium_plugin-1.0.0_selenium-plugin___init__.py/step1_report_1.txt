  "purpose": "Importing a function named 'enable_other_autostart_feature' from a local module called 'autostart' and aliasing it as 'load'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed beyond import; function call not shown.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an alias 'load' for a function related to autostart features could be suspicious if the function's purpose is malicious, but as code is minimal, no direct anomaly detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a specific function from a relative module. The filename and function name suggest it might be related to enabling autostart behavior, which could be misused if malicious, but there is no evidence here of malicious intent or behavior. There are no data flows, input handling, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code fragment. The function's purpose could potentially be misused in a larger context, but from this snippet alone, it appears benign.",
