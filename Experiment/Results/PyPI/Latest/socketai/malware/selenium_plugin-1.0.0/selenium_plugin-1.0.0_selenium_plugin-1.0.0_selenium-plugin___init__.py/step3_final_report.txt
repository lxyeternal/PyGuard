{
  "purpose": "Import the function 'enable_other_autostart_feature' from a local module, aliasing it as 'load'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module '.autostart'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the code only imports a function without executing it.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function related to autostart features, which could be used for persistence or system modification. However, the snippet itself contains only an import statement with no execution, data handling, or malicious patterns. The function's name suggests potential for misuse, but without its implementation, no malicious activity can be confirmed. The import alone is benign, and no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent is present. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to the potential misuse of the autostart feature if implemented maliciously, but this cannot be determined from the snippet. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is set at 0.1 to reflect cautious awareness of possible misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The primary concern is the potential misuse of the imported function in a larger context, but there is no evidence here to support malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and conservative, reflecting minimal risk based solely on this import statement.",
