  "purpose": "Import a function named 'enable_other_autostart_feature' from a local module 'autostart', aliasing it as 'load'.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing 'enable_other_autostart_feature' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'autostart' module to the current namespace via import, with no further data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'enable_other_autostart_feature' could be suspicious if the module or function is maliciously designed to enable persistence or auto-start mechanisms, but based solely on this line, no unusual behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a specific function from a local module, possibly related to auto-start features. Without additional context or implementation details, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The function's name suggests it may enable startup behaviors, which could be benign or potentially used for persistence mechanisms if misused. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no immediate signs of malicious intent. It could be part of a larger module that manages autostart functionalities. No malicious activity is detectable from this snippet alone.",
