  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'selenium-plugin' package, including a post-install hook to run a setup function from 'autostart.py'.",
  "sources": "The subprocess.run call executing a Python command to import and run 'run_autostart_setup' from 'selenium-plugin.autostart'.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call is a sink where untrusted data could be executed, but in this case it runs a controlled Python command. No other untrusted data sources are evident.",
  "flows": "The code executes a subprocess that runs a Python command to invoke 'run_autostart_setup' from 'autostart.py', which could potentially perform actions if malicious, but the setup indicates it's part of the package's install process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to run a Python command during post-install is unusual and can be exploited if 'autostart.py' contains malicious code. The code itself does not contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up the package using setuptools, with a post-install hook that executes a subprocess running a Python command to import and run a function from 'autostart.py'. This approach can be risky if 'autostart.py' contains malicious code, as it executes code during installation. The subprocess command is straightforward but could be exploited if the content of 'autostart.py' is malicious or altered. The rest of the setup code appears standard, with no suspicious dependencies or code structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a standard setup script with an unconventional post-install hook that executes code during installation. While not inherently malicious, the use of subprocess to run code from 'autostart.py' warrants caution, as it can potentially execute malicious code if the file is compromised or maliciously crafted.",
