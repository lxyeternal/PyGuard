  "conclusion": "The code does not execute any malicious actions as-is because the 'post_install()' function is not invoked. The security concern lies in the potential for this function to be called during setup, which could execute malicious code if 'autostart.py' is compromised. Therefore, the current risk is low, but the mechanism should be carefully managed and verified before activation."
