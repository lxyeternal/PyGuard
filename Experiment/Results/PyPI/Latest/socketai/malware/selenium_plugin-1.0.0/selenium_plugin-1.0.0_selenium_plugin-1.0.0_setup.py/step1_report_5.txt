{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package called 'selenium-plugin' that manages installation and post-installation setup procedures, including running an autostart configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata from setup arguments, the README file, and executes a subprocess command during post-install.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess command executes Python code to run 'run_autostart_setup()' from 'autostart.py', which could perform further actions.",
  "flows": "The setup script gathers metadata and dependencies, then during installation runs the subprocess command to execute code from 'selenium-plugin.autostart'.",
  "anomalies": "The 'post_install' function is defined but not invoked within the script, meaning the potentially impactful code is not executed during setup. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present. The subprocess command runs a Python module dynamically, which could be malicious if 'run_autostart_setup' is malicious, but this is part of the package's intended behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be a typical setup configuration for a Python package, including a function intended for post-installation setup. The subprocess call is designed to run a setup routine from 'autostart.py', which might automate startup processes. Since the 'post_install' function is not called in the script, it does not execute by default, reducing immediate risk. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident. The use of subprocess to run code from within the package is common but could be dangerous if the invoked code is malicious. However, based solely on this script, the behavior aligns with normal package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script with an unused post-install hook intended to automate startup procedures. No malicious intent or malicious code is evident within this script itself. The actual risk depends on the content of 'autostart.py' and 'run_autostart_setup', which are not provided here. Given the current code, the potential for malicious behavior appears low.",
