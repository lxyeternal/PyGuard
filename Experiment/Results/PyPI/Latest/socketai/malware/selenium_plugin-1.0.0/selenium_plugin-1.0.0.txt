      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code does not execute any malicious actions as-is because the 'post_install()' function is not invoked. The security concern lies in the potential for this function to be called during setup, which could execute malicious code if 'autostart.py' is compromised. Therefore, the current risk is low, but the mechanism should be carefully managed and verified before activation."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The primary concern is the potential misuse of the imported function in a larger context, but there is no evidence here to support malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and conservative, reflecting minimal risk based solely on this import statement."

      "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors consistent with malware persistence mechanisms, including unvalidated external code execution and system modification for autostart. While not definitively malicious without source validation, the activity pattern warrants high suspicion and caution."
