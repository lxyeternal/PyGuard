{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library called 'python-bitget-wrapper'.",
  "sources": "The script reads the README.md file for long description; other data is hardcoded or static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network operations, file writing, or execution of untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static strings and the README file into package metadata; no external input or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. Usage of open() to read the README.md is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, including name, version, packages, description, URL, author info, and classifiers. No code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. All inputs are static or files expected in the package source, with no indication of malicious intent. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It performs normal package configuration tasks without any signs of malware, security risks, or obfuscation.",
