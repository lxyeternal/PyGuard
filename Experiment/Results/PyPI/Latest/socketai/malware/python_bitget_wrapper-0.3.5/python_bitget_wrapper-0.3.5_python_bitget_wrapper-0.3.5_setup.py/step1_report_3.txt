{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'python-bitget-wrapper'. It specifies package metadata and dependencies for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data or external inputs within this script.",
  "flows": "The source of external data (reading 'README.md') flows into the package description metadata during setup.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities from setuptools and calls setup() with static metadata, including package name, version, description, URL, author info, and classifiers. It reads the long description from a README file, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or external data manipulation is present. The script appears to be a typical package setup script without any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply prepares metadata for the package 'python-bitget-wrapper'.",
