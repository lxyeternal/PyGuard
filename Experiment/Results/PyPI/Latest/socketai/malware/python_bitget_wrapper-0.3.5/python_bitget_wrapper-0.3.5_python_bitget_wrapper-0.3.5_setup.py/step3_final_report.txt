  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script defining package metadata, reading a static README.md file without any dynamic or malicious code execution. No network activity, user input handling, or obfuscated code is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0, with high confidence. The only minor concern is the lack of error handling when reading 'README.md', but this is standard practice and not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py script is a benign, standard package configuration file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
