  "purpose": "A simple addition function performing 'return a + b'.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' used in the addition operation.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly into the addition operation and return the result.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic addition function with no external data reads, network activity, or obfuscation. It performs a simple arithmetic operation with parameters 'a' and 'b'. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or side effects indicate a benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a simple addition, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. The scores are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
