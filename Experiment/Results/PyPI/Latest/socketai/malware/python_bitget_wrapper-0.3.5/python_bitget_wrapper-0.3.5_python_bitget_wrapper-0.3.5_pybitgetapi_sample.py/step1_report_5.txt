  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly into the addition operation and then to the return statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward addition operation without hidden or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'add' that takes two parameters and returns their sum. There are no external data sources, environment variables, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to serve a simple arithmetic purpose without any complex logic or potential security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and free from malicious intent. It is a basic addition function with no security issues or suspicious behavior.",
