{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process that includes downloading and executing an external executable during installation.",
  "sources": "The requests.get call to download an executable from a specified URL, and os.system to run the downloaded file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the downloaded file via os.system('start ' + filename), which runs the executable potentially without user consent.",
  "flows": "The code downloads an executable from an external URL, saves it locally, and then automatically runs it during the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The package automatically downloads and executes an external executable without user interaction, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The executable URL is hardcoded and points to an external source, which could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script uses setuptools to define package installation behavior. The custom install class PostInstallCommand overrides the run method to execute a function send(). This function downloads an executable from a remote URL and immediately executes it, bypassing user consent or validation. Such behavior is highly suspicious as it can facilitate malware delivery, remote code execution, or backdoor installation. The code does not perform any validation of the downloaded file, nor does it inform the user of this action, raising significant security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely malicious or at least maliciously suspicious, as it downloads and executes external code during package installation without user approval or verification. This pattern is characteristic of supply chain attacks and malware delivery mechanisms.",
