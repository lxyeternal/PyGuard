{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up a Python package that, during installation, downloads an executable file from a specified URL and automatically executes it.",
  "sources": "The 'send' function fetches data from a remote URL using requests.get(), which is a source of untrusted data. The download occurs during the post-installation process.",
  "sinks": "The open(filename, 'wb').write(rqs.content) writes untrusted data to disk; os.system('start ' + filename) executes the downloaded file, potentially running malicious code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the external URL into the requests.get() call, then to writing to disk, and finally to executing the downloaded file via os.system().",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically downloads and executes an external executable during package installation without user consent or warning. The URL points to an executable, and the execution is triggered automatically, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The setup script includes a custom post-install command that calls a function 'send'. This function downloads an executable file from a remote URL and executes it immediately. This behavior resembles malicious activity, such as installing unwanted or malicious software during package installation. The use of requests to fetch external content, writing it to disk, and executing it without user interaction or transparency are significant security concerns. There are no indications of obfuscation or attempts to hide this behavior; the code is straightforward but intentionally malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code demonstrates malicious behavior by downloading and executing an external executable during installation, which can harm the user system or perform unauthorized actions. It appears to be intentionally designed to compromise security.",
