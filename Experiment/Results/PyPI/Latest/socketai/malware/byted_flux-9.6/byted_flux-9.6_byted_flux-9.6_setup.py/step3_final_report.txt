  "purpose": "The code executes the 'main()' function from an external module during package installation, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' and calling 'main()' in the overridden 'run()' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during install, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if 'main()' contains malicious code.",
  "flows": "From the 'run()' method of 'CrazyInstallStrat' to the imported 'main()' function, executing code during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual pattern of executing external code during package installation; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install class that calls 'main()' from an external module during installation, a pattern that can be exploited for malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and lacks obfuscation. Multiple reports correctly identify this behavior as suspicious, with scores reflecting the potential risk. The malware scores are generally high (~0.75), justified by the risk of arbitrary code execution. The security risk scores are also high (~0.75), given the dangerous pattern. No evidence suggests 'main()' is malicious, but the pattern itself warrants caution. The scores are consistent with the behavior, though some could be slightly increased to reflect the severity more conservatively.",
  "conclusion": "Executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' is untrusted or malicious. The pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks. The current scores are appropriate, with a recommendation to set malware and risk scores around 0.75–0.8 to reflect the high potential for abuse.",
