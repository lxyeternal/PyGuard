  "conclusion": "Executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' is untrusted or malicious. The pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks. The current scores are appropriate, with a recommendation to set malware and risk scores around 0.75–0.8 to reflect the high potential for abuse."
