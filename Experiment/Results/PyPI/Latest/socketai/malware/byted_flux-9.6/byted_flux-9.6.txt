      "conclusion": "Executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, especially if 'main()' is untrusted or malicious. The pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks. The current scores are appropriate, with a recommendation to set malware and risk scores around 0.75–0.8 to reflect the high potential for abuse."

      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates covert data exfiltration to suspicious external domains, with behaviors indicative of malicious or privacy-invasive activity. It lacks destructive payloads but poses significant security and privacy risks. The high scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the overall assessment should classify this as highly suspicious or malicious code."
