  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via encoded URLs to external servers.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network interfaces, random.randint() for number generation.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, base64-encoded MAC addresses, and a random number) flows from source functions into URL parameters, then transmitted over network via urllib.request.urlopen() to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names (oast.cn, oast.fun), encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, no explicit data validation or encryption beyond base64, silent exception handling which can hide errors, and the presence of hardcoded external endpoints that could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system data including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses with base64. It constructs URLs with this data as URL parameters targeting three external servers with suspicious domain names. The data is transmitted silently using urllib.request.urlopen() without validation or encryption beyond base64 encoding. The code does not perform any explicit validation, logging, or user consent. The use of external, potentially malicious URLs and silent data transmission indicates possible malicious intent to exfiltrate system information.",
  "conclusion": "The script is designed to gather and transmit system-specific information to external servers under suspicious domain names, which strongly suggests malicious intent related to data exfiltration or system reconnaissance. It does not appear to serve a benign purpose and exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious activity.",
