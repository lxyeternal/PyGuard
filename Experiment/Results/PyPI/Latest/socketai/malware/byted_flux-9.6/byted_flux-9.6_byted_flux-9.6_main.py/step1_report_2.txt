  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs via HTTP GET requests with encoded MAC addresses and other system data as parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node() (hostname), getpass.getuser() (username), os.getcwd() (current directory), get_mac_addresses() (MAC addresses), random.randint() (rd_num), base64.b64encode() (MAC encoding), urllib.parse.urlencode() (URL parameters), urllib.request.urlopen() (HTTP requests)",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) (sending data over network to external servers)",
  "flows": "System info sources → URL parameter encoding → full_url → urlopen() (network transmission)",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, encoding of MAC addresses, sending data without clear user consent, and broad exception handling that suppresses errors which might hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system data including hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current working directory. It encodes MAC addresses in base64 and constructs URLs with these parameters, then makes HTTP GET requests to three different suspicious domains. The URLs and domains appear unusual and potentially malicious, possibly for tracking or exfiltration. The code does not perform any validation or user notification, and exceptions during network requests are silently ignored. The data collection and transmission happen unconditionally, indicating possible privacy invasion or malicious intent. No evidence of malicious payload execution or backdoors is present, but the data exfiltration activity and suspicious domains suggest malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to silently collect system information and transmit it to external, suspicious domains without user consent, indicating potentially malicious intent for data exfiltration or tracking. While there is no direct malware or backdoor code, the behavior is suspicious and warrants caution.",
