{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() which reads system network interfaces, and the base64-encoded MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which transmits data over the network to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Collected data from sources (system info, MAC addresses) is encoded and appended as URL parameters, then sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious, potentially malicious (e.g., domains with 'oast' and unusual subdomains), the MAC addresses are base64-encoded and sent without encryption, and no data validation or user consent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script collects system info including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across different operating systems. The MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to obscure their content. The script then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and transmits this information via HTTP GET requests. There is no user consent, logging, or clear benign purpose. The external domains appear non-standard and may be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or direct system damage, but it performs potentially privacy-invasive data collection and transmission to suspicious endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main function is to gather and exfiltrate system identifiers and user info to external servers, which is suspicious. The domains suggest possible malicious or tracking activity. While it does not contain direct malware, the behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration and privacy violation. Therefore, this code is potentially malicious with a high security risk.",
