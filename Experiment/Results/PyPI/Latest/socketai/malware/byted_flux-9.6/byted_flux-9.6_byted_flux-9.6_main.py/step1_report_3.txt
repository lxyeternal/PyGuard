  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reads system details (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses()), generates a random number, encodes MAC addresses, and constructs URLs with parameters.",
  "sinks": "Performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs with sensitive system info embedded as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> encodes MAC addresses -> constructs URLs with info -> sends GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains (with 'oast' and 'cn' in hostnames, commonly used in security testing or malicious activities), encoding of MAC addresses, dynamic URL construction, and sending system info without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system details such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encoding the MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends system info as URL parameters via HTTP GET requests. The domains used are associated with testing or potentially malicious activities. The code does not appear to perform harmful actions directly on the system but actively exfiltrates sensitive system information to external servers, which is a significant privacy concern and potentially malicious behavior. The use of random numbers in URL parameters may be to avoid caching or tracking. No obfuscated code, malicious payload, or destructive actions are observed, but the behavior of exfiltration to untrusted domains is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily exfiltrating system information to external servers, which could be used for malicious tracking or data theft. Although it does not perform destructive actions, the behavior is suspicious and indicates potential privacy invasion or reconnaissance activity.",
