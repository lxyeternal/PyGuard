{
  "purpose": "Minimal Python code importing 'sendtowev' and printing a success message.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import sendtowev'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only imports a package and prints a message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and print statement, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The primary concern is the external package 'sendtowev', which cannot be assessed here. Malware score is justified as 0, obfuscation as 0, and security risk as low (~0.1-0.2) due to potential suspicion of the package name. Confidence in the benign nature of the code is high (around 0.8), but the overall security posture depends on the trustworthiness of the package itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main risk stems from the external package 'sendtowev', which cannot be evaluated here. The assigned scores are appropriate given the evidence, and no further action is necessary unless the package is found to be malicious upon inspection.",
