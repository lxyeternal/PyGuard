  "conclusion": "The code is benign and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main risk stems from the external package 'sendtowev', which cannot be evaluated here. The assigned scores are appropriate given the evidence, and no further action is necessary unless the package is found to be malicious upon inspection."
