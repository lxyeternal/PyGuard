{
  "purpose": "The code imports the 'sendtowev' package and prints a confirmation message indicating successful import.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'import sendtowev' reads data from the package source.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to the console, which is not a security sink but indicates execution flow.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported package (source) into the program and then to the console output.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'sendtowev' could potentially be suspicious, but without further context or code, it appears to be a normal import and print statement. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a third-party package and printing a success message. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious logic. The package name alone does not indicate malicious intent, but without inspecting the package itself, its safety cannot be fully guaranteed. The code does not perform any sensitive operations or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, merely importing a package and printing a message. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risks within this code fragment.",
