  "purpose": "Import a module named sendtowev and print a success message",
  "sources": "Import statement for sendtowev",
  "sinks": "Print statement (output to console)",
  "flows": "Import sendtowev -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; simple import and print statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named sendtowev and then prints a confirmation message. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The import could be malicious if the sendtowev module itself is malicious, but this cannot be determined solely from this code snippet. The code structure is straightforward and typical.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple module import and print statement with no immediate signs of malicious activity. However, the security risk largely depends on the content of the sendtowev module, which is not visible here.",
