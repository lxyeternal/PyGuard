  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple import of 'sendtowev' and a print statement.\n- None of the reports identify any actual malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The primary concern is the package name 'sendtowev', which could imply data transmission, but without inspecting the package content, this remains speculative.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of evidence for malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward and correct; it imports 'sendtowev' and prints a message.\n- **Issues present:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in this code snippet itself.\n- **Malware presence:** No malware is evident in the code snippet; the malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports indicate no obfuscation, which is correct.\n- **Suspiciousness of package name:** While 'sendtowev' could be suspicious, this is purely speculative without inspecting the package itself.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified based on the code snippet. No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable considering the package name could be suspicious but there's no evidence of actual risk.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **On report 3:** The confidence score is 0.6, but the reasoning suggests minimal suspicion. Given the code's simplicity, a confidence of 0.8 or higher would be more appropriate.\n- **On report 5:** The confidence is 0.4, but the code is very simple; perhaps increasing confidence to 0.7 would be justified.\n- **On all reports:** The risk scores are acceptable, but they could be slightly increased if the package name is considered suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is benign.** The main unknown is the content of the 'sendtowev' package. Since the code only imports and prints, no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 - 0.2 (low, primarily due to package name suspicion)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n| Score Type     | Justification                                                                                   |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0, no signs of malicious activity in the code snippet.                                        |\n| Obfuscated     | 0, code is straightforward and not obfuscated.                                                  |\n| Security Risk  | 0.1-0.2, minimal risk; potential concern is the package name, but no evidence.                |\n\n**Final note:** The security concern hinges on the actual content of the 'sendtowev' package, which cannot be assessed here. For a comprehensive evaluation, inspecting the package code or behavior would be necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to generate a summarized report based on this analysis?**",
