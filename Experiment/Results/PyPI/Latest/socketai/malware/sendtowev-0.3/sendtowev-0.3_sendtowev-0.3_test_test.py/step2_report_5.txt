  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence, reasoning, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal: just importing 'sendtowev' and printing a success message.\n- No suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The main concern revolves around the package 'sendtowev' itself, which cannot be evaluated from this code snippet alone.\n- Malware scores are all zero, reflecting no direct malicious activity observed.\n- Security risk scores are low, indicating minimal immediate risk based on the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any errors, flaws, or malicious behavior.\n- The import statement is straightforward; no signs of obfuscation or malicious code.\n- The risk is primarily dependent on the nature of the 'sendtowev' package, which cannot be determined here.\n\n### Potential flaws or reasoning errors:\n- No flaws are evident in the reasoning; all reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- Some reports suggest potential suspicion based on the package name, which is reasonable, but they do not claim malicious behavior solely based on the name.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, justified given no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **SecurityRisk:** ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the minimal code but potential concern about the package name.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No report assigns a risk score higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- Since the code is benign and no malicious activity is detected, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports correctly avoid assuming malicious behavior solely based on the package name.\n- They acknowledge that the actual behavior depends on the package contents, which are not visible here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, based on package name suspicion, but no concrete evidence)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to uncertainty about the package itself)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign; the only concern is the package 'sendtowev' which cannot be assessed here. The scores in the reports are consistent and appropriate given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** If further analysis of the 'sendtowev' package itself reveals malicious content, these scores should be updated accordingly.",
