  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module possibly intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external resources such as network or file I/O (if present in omitted sections).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data outputs like print statements, file writes, network communications, or environment variable modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions, environment variables, or external data sources towards sinks such as outputs, network transmissions, or storage, via various intermediate operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flows are detected. The code structure appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured in a conventional manner, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. There are no suspicious patterns like dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. All data handling appears standard, with no evident insecure practices such as unsanitized SQL queries or unsafe eval calls.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be a benign utility or processing module. The overall malware score is low, and security risks are minimal.",
