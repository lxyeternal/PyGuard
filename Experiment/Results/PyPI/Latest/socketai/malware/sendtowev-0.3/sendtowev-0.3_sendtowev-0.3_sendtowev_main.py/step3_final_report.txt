  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on supplied code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, data flows from inputs to outputs, external files or network calls (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points, network transmission functions, file write/read operations, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Source points (inputs) to sink points (outputs or external communication), including environment variables, data processing functions, and network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, suspicious network domains, unusual data flows, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate the code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low risk 0.2) are justified given the limited context. Confidence levels range from 0.6 to 0.9, reflecting the clarity or ambiguity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The assessments align with the evidence, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities identified. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
