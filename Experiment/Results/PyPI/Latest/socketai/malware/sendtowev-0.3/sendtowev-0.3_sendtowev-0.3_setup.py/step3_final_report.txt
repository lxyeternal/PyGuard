  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data fields: package name, version, description, author, author_email, dependencies, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network operations, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process or handle untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static, well-defined package metadata. It imports setuptools, defines package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated elements are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The missing author info is incomplete but not suspicious. The dependency 'requests' is common and benign. The code poses no security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
