  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'sendtowev' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (name, version, description, author, author_email) and dependencies from the 'install_requires' list.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network or file operations are performed within this script.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from defined package parameters to the packaging process; no data flows from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Missing author and author_email values could be considered incomplete but are not suspicious or malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration using setuptools. It does not include any code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security issues are evident. It appears to be a typical, benign package setup file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected. It functions as intended for package distribution.",
