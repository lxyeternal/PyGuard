{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting, collecting, and exfiltrating sensitive user data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, browser histories, and other private information from the user's system and various applications. It also includes mechanisms to upload the collected data to external servers and possibly maliciously monitor or track the user.",
  "sources": "User input and data read from system files (e.g., browser storage, wallet files, configuration files, logs, local state files, and directories such as AppData, Roaming, Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It also fetches data from web resources (e.g., IP address, external servers, and APIs).",
  "sinks": "External webhooks and file uploads for exfiltration of data; subprocess calls that kill processes or manipulate files; network requests to external servers for uploading or retrieving data; execution of malicious or system commands (e.g., taskkill, file zipping, file uploading).",
  "flows": "Data flows from system file reads and web requests (sources) to external servers via HTTP requests and uploads (sinks). Data such as tokens, passwords, cookies, browser histories, and wallet info are collected and then sent to a remote webhook or file upload URL. The code also retrieves system info and user data for exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation or concealment of malicious intent through dynamic code, external fetches of code, and extensive use of threading for concurrent data collection. The code automatically installs missing modules without user consent, accesses browser, wallet, and application data directories, and uses process killing commands to terminate processes like browsers or debuggers. There are hardcoded webhook URLs, functions that extract tokens and credentials, and automated uploading mechanisms that indicate malicious data collection behavior. Also, the code sets itself to run at startup by copying to startup folders. The code also fetches external data from suspicious URLs and processes it without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing numerous modules and ensuring dependencies are installed. It contains anti-debugging measures, such as process enumeration and registry checks for virtual machine or debugger signatures. It verifies the system’s environment to detect virtual machines or debugging tools. It fetches various URLs and external data, including hostnames, token data, and external scripts. It searches for sensitive data like tokens in log files, browser data, wallet files, and cookies. It collects user account info, browser histories, bookmarks, passwords, cookies, and other personal data from multiple browsers and applications. The script then encodes and uploads this data via webhooks and file uploads to external servers, specifically to a Discord webhook and a file hosting service. It terminates certain processes (browsers, wallets) to possibly prevent interference or to ensure access to files. The code is heavily obfuscated and employs threading to perform multiple data extraction routines concurrently. It sets itself to run at startup by copying itself to the startup folder, indicating persistence behavior. All these behaviors point toward comprehensive data theft with external exfiltration, typical of malware or information stealer modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent, designed for stealthy extraction of sensitive user data from browsers, wallets, and system files, and exfiltrates this data to external servers. It includes anti-debugging, anti-VM, and persistence mechanisms, consistent with malware or spyware behavior. The code’s multiple data collection methods and automated upload features strongly indicate a malicious payload aimed at stealing personal and system data.",
