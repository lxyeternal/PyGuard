{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to extract sensitive user data from the system, including Discord tokens, browser credentials, cookies, history, bookmarks, wallet information, and other personal data, then upload and exfiltrate it via webhook or file upload services.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from system environment variables, browser storage files, local state files, and log/database files containing tokens, passwords, cookies, history, bookmarks, and wallet info.",
  "sinks": "Collected data is sent via Discord webhook and uploaded to file hosting services like Gofile.io; functions like UP104D, UP104D7060F113 perform network operations to exfiltrate data.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data is read from local system files, databases, environment variables, and network responses; then it flows through decoding, decryption, and formatting functions before being sent over network channels to exfiltration endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to hide its activity by copying itself to startup folders, suppressing standard error output, disabling debuggers, and killing processes associated with debuggers or analysis tools. It also downloads external scripts and configurations, and dynamically installs dependencies. It uses obfuscated and suspicious regex patterns for token extraction. There are functions that exfiltrate Discord tokens, browser credentials, and wallet data, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by suppressing error outputs and ensuring required libraries are installed. It includes anti-debugging checks such as enumerating windows, registry checks for VMWare, DLL existence checks, and IP-based blacklisting. It downloads configuration data from external URLs, likely for control or configuration. It collects system information, such as public IP, and inspects multiple browsers for saved credentials, cookies, history, bookmarks, and wallet data. The code searches for tokens in log files and database files, decrypts stored credentials using Windows Data Protection API, and exfiltrates all gathered data via Discord webhook and file uploads. It also copies itself to startup folders for persistence. The overall structure and behavior strongly suggest this is a credential stealer, designed to harvest user credentials, tokens, and personal data for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This script exhibits malicious behavior typical of credential stealing malware, including system information collection, credential extraction, process termination of analysis tools, self-persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration. It targets multiple browsers, cryptocurrency wallets, and communication tokens, indicating a comprehensive info-stealing malware. Its use of obfuscation, external configuration downloads, and anti-debugging measures further confirm malicious intent.",
