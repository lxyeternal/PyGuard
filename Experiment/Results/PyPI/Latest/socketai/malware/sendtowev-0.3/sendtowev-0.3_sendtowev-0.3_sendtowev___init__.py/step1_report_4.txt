{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting and exfiltrating sensitive data such as Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, browser history, bookmarks, wallet information, and other personal data from the user’s system, then uploading and sharing this data via webhooks and file hosting services.",
  "sources": "Sources include environment variables, local files (browser storage, wallet files, database files, local State files), running processes, network requests to specific URLs (e.g., checkip.amazonaws.com, geolocation-db.com, gofile.io), and the system registry.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points include HTTP POST requests to Discord webhooks, gofile.io file uploads, and remote API calls. The script also writes collected data into text files in the TEMP directory and uploads them. Additionally, it kills processes related to browsers and cryptocurrency wallets before extracting data, which could be considered disruptive behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system sources (local files, registry, environment variables, process list) through parsing and decoding functions, then is aggregated into formatted messages or files, and finally sent via webhooks or uploaded to external servers. The code also involves process termination and file manipulations that facilitate data extraction and exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, aggressive process killing commands, multiple network requests to external and suspicious URLs, and the collection of a wide range of sensitive data (browser info, passwords, cookies, wallet info, tokens, history). It automatically copies itself into startup folder to ensure persistence, and suppresses standard error output. The presence of hardcoded URLs, extensive data harvesting, and self-replication behavior are typical of malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed as a credential stealer and data exfiltrator. It checks for debugging environments and virtual machine indicators, which suggests an attempt to evade detection. It fetches configuration data from remote URLs and gathers system information, browser data, wallet info, and Discord tokens. It then uploads the data to external services (like gofile.io) and sends detailed reports via Discord webhook. The code uses threading to perform parallel data collection, terminates related processes to disable security measures or prevent interference, and copies itself into the startup directory for persistence. Its broad scope of data collection, suppression of error output, and self-installation behavior strongly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious; it functions as a comprehensive info-stealer targeting credentials, tokens, financial data, browsing history, and more, then exfiltrates the data via webhooks and file uploads. It also employs evasion techniques like process termination, environment checks, and self-replication, confirming its intent to operate covertly and harmfully.",
