{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to extract, collect, and exfiltrate sensitive information such as tokens, passwords, cookies, browser history, and other user data from the system and browsers, then upload this data to external servers or webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, system registry, local files (browser data, wallet files, logs), and network requests to external URLs for configuration and IP information.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points include sending data via webhooks (Discord webhook URL), HTTP POST requests to external URLs, and file uploads to file-sharing services like Gofile.",
  "flows": "Data flows from various local data sources (browser storage, logs, wallet files, cookies) to processing functions, which decrypt, parse, and compile the sensitive data, then send it to external servers or webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behaviors include self-replication to startup folder, use of threading for concurrent operations, dynamic code fetching from external URLs, obfuscation-like patterns in code structure, and extensive use of external requests to unknown URLs. The code also kills common security or debugging processes and checks for virtual machine indicators, indicating anti-analysis measures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex stealer targeting multiple browsers, wallets, and applications to harvest tokens, passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data. It decrypts stored credentials using master keys extracted from local state files. It also performs anti-debugging, VM detection, and IP blacklisting checks, which are typical in malicious payloads. The script uses threading to speed up data collection and then uploads the compiled data to Discord webhooks and file-sharing services, indicating malicious intent to exfiltrate user data stealthily. Its presence in startup folder and behavior confirms persistence mechanisms. The code's use of external configuration URLs, obfuscated naming, and broad data collection confirms malicious design.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a malicious data stealer targeting browser credentials, tokens, cookies, and system info, designed to exfiltrate sensitive data to external servers. It employs anti-debugging, VM detection, persistence, and extensive external data fetching, all characteristic of malware. It poses a high security threat and should be considered malicious and dangerous to system integrity.",
