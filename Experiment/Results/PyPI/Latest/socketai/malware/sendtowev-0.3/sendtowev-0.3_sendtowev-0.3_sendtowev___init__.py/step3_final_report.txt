{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a comprehensive information stealer targeting Discord tokens, passwords, cookies, browser histories, wallets, and system info. It exfiltrates data via webhooks and file uploads, employs anti-debugging, persistence, and process termination to evade detection.",
  "sources": "Reads input/data from browser storage files, wallet files, logs, environment variables, and external URLs (e.g., IP, config URLs). Uses regex and decryption functions to extract tokens, credentials, and wallet info.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data to external webhooks, uploads files to external servers, terminates security/debugging processes, and copies itself into startup folders for persistence.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local system files and environment variables through decryption and parsing functions, then exfiltrates via web requests (webhooks, uploads). External URLs provide configs and IP info, while process termination and self-copying ensure stealth.",
  "anomalies": "Uses threading for concurrent data collection, dynamically fetches external code/configs, suppresses errors, copies itself into startup, and employs obfuscation techniques like regex patterns and variable renaming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits extensive malicious behaviors: collecting tokens, passwords, cookies, browser histories, wallet info; decrypting stored credentials; killing security processes; copying itself for persistence; fetching external configs; exfiltrating data via webhooks and uploads. Obfuscation is present but not extreme. External URL fetches and threading increase complexity. Overall, the code is designed for stealthy, high-volume data theft with evasion techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a high-severity malware (info-stealer) with extensive data exfiltration, anti-debugging, persistence, and evasion capabilities. The behavior aligns with a malicious threat, and the scoring (malware: 1.0, obfuscated: ~0.7, risk: 1.0) is justified based on its actions.",
