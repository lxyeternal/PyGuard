{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for extracting sensitive information from the user's system, including credentials, browser data, cookies, history, and wallet information, and then exfiltrating this data via webhook and upload to file-sharing services.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from various locations including local system files (browser data, wallet data, cookies, history, bookmarks), environment variables (e.g., USERNAME, LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP), and network responses (IP address, geolocation, file uploads). It also processes files such as login databases, cookies, local state files, and browser storage files.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows include sending collected information via webhook requests, uploading files to file-sharing services (gofile.io), and executing system commands (taskkill, curl). It also reads sensitive tokens from logs and potentially from user files, then exfiltrates them.",
  "flows": "Sources like browser data, wallet files, cookies, history, and tokens flow into decryption and parsing functions, then are combined into formatted payloads which are sent via HTTP requests (webhook/post) and uploads (file sharing). The code kills processes (e.g., browsers, wallets) before copying their data, then uploads and reports the results.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple suspicious behaviors including: dynamic code execution, process termination of security-related or debugging tools, continuous network requests to check IP and blacklists, aggressive process killing, collection of stored tokens/passwords, and exfiltration of data. The code also forcibly copies itself to startup folder for persistence. Additionally, the use of external URLs for data exfiltration and file uploads indicates malicious intent. The use of functions like 'ExitProcess', process termination, and background thread monitoring for debugging/debuggers are typical anti-debugging measures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical credential-stealer or info-stealer malware: it begins by importing necessary modules, some of which are installed dynamically. It performs anti-debugging checks and process termination to evade analysis. It collects user info such as IP, geolocation, Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, history, bookmarks, wallet data, and system info. It uses various functions to decrypt stored data, gather Discord-related info (friends, guilds, badges), and upload the data to external servers (webhook, gofile). It also copies itself to startup for persistence. All these behaviors combined strongly indicate malicious activity aimed at data theft, privacy invasion, and remote exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to steal user credentials, tokens, browser data, wallet info, and system info, then exfiltrate this data via webhooks and file uploads. It employs anti-debugging and persistence techniques to evade detection. The overall security risk is extremely high.",
