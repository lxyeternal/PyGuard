  "purpose": "Import error flag constants from the web3_eth library for handling event log errors.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'web3_eth._utils.events' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific constants related to error flags from a well-known web3 library, which is used in blockchain interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The imported constants are likely used elsewhere in the project for error handling. No hardcoded secrets, unsafe code, or obfuscation detected. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign import statement intended to use predefined error flags from a reputable blockchain library. No malicious or security-related issues are evident.",
