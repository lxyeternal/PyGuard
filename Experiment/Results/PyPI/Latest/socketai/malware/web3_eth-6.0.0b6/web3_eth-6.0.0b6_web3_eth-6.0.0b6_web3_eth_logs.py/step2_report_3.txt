  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: importing constants from a well-known web3 library.\n- No data flows, sinks, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is standard for setting up error handling in blockchain applications.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a straightforward import statement, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n- The imported constants are from a reputable library, used for error handling, not malicious purposes.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reports. They are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0\n  - **securityRisk:** 0\n  - **obfuscated:** 0\n  - **confidence:** 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No issues warrant a high risk score. The code is purely an import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Correctly set to 0, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the minimal, benign nature of this code snippet, I agree with the provided scores. No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a simple, well-understood import statement.\n- No malicious activity, data leaks, or security flaws are evident.\n- The context (importing constants from a reputable library) supports a benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of this code. No further action or adjustment is needed.",
