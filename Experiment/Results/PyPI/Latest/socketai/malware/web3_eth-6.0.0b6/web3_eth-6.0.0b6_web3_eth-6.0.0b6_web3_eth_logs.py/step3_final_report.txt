  "purpose": "Import error flag constants from the web3_eth._utils.events module for use in blockchain error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from web3_eth._utils.events module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; solely imports constants",
  "flows": "Import of EventLogErrorFlags followed by assignment to local variables",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward import",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward import of constants from a reputable blockchain utility library. It involves no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import serves as setup for error handling in blockchain applications, which is standard practice. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement for error flags in a blockchain context. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and reflect the safe, straightforward nature of the snippet.",
