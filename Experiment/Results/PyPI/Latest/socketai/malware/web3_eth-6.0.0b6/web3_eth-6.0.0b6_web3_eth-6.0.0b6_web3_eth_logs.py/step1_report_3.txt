  "purpose": "This code imports specific error flag constants from the web3_eth._utils.events module, likely for configuring event log handling behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the web3_eth._utils.events module.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The imported constants are assigned to local variables, which are then used elsewhere in the codebase (not shown here).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs a module import and assigns imported constants to local variables. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present in this minimal snippet. Given the context, the code appears to be part of a larger project setting error handling modes for event logs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and standard for setting up logging/error handling configurations. No malicious intent or security risks are identified based solely on this snippet.",
