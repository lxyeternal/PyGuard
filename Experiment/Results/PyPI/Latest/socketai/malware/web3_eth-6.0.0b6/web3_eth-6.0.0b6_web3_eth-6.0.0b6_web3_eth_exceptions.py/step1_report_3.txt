{
  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling various errors in a web3 Ethereum context, including blockchain data issues, ABI mismatches, request errors, and validation errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from external sources indirectly via exception handling triggered by blockchain data, user input validation, and external RPC calls.",
  "sinks": "Exception classes could potentially be raised or caught in other parts of an application; no direct data leakage or insecure operation occurs here.",
  "flows": "Errors propagate via exceptions; no data flows from untrusted sources directly within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive exception class definitions, mostly standard for blockchain interactions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines custom exception classes related to blockchain and web3 operations. These classes are standard, mostly inheriting from built-in exceptions or other exception classes. The only method with logic is 'StaleBlockchain', which formats a timestamp and calculates delay, but this is straightforward and does not exhibit malicious intent. No code performs network operations, data collection, or any suspicious activities. The code structure and content suggest a well-structured error handling module without signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of exception class definitions for a blockchain web3 library, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It serves as error handling infrastructure and does not perform any harmful actions.",
