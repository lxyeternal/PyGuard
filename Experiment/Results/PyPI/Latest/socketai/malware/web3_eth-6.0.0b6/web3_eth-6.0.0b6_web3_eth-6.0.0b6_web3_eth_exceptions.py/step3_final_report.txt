  "purpose": "Defines a comprehensive set of exception classes for error handling in a blockchain/web3 Ethereum client library, facilitating structured error reporting and management.",
  "sources": "Exception classes and their attributes, including message formatting with block data and payloads.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and data attributes used for error reporting; no untrusted data flows or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Error conditions trigger exceptions; messages are constructed from provided data but do not involve external or unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward exception class definitions with standard message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions used for error handling in a blockchain client context. No data processing, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. Exception messages are constructed from passed-in data for debugging purposes, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of exception classes used for error management within a blockchain client library. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The exception handling design is standard and safe for production use.",
