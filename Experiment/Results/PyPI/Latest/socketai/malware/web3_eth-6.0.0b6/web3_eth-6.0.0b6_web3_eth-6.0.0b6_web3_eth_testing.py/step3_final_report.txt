{
  "purpose": "Provides testing utilities for blockchain state manipulation such as time travel, mining, snapshot, reset, and revert via RPC calls.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to methods (e.g., timestamp, num_blocks, snapshot_idx) and internal state (last_snapshot_idx).",
  "sinks": "RPC request_blocking calls with specific RPC identifiers and parameters, affecting blockchain state.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow directly into RPC requests, influencing blockchain state during testing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Ethereum testing RPCs, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It accepts parameters for testing purposes and calls standard RPC functions. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code's simplicity and purpose are clear, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard testing utility for Ethereum environments, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified given its testing context. No modifications to the scores or assessments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
