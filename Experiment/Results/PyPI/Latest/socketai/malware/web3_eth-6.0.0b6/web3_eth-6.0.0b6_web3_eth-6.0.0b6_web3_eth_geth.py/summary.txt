  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent API wrapper for Ethereum Geth management functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0 are justified. The low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate, considering potential external misuse but no inherent vulnerabilities. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for management tasks without concerns of malicious activity."
