  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module setup, importing various classes and retrieving package version info.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, data handling, or user input processing is identified.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The code is standard for a Python package's __init__.py or setup module, intended to expose certain classes and version info.\n\n---\n\n### Specific report assessments:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code imports modules and sets up exports; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard setup.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: straightforward import and version retrieval, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Also consistent with the previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** all zero.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but still very low.\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as others, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Justification:** Given the code's benign nature, a 0.1 score for securityRisk seems slightly high; perhaps a conservative default or a minor note about import complexity, but no real risk.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly overestimating; I would suggest lowering this to 0 or 0.05 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely import/setup with no runtime or data handling, the risk score should be minimal, ideally 0. The 0.1 in report 5 seems unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n- The code is a standard module setup for a blockchain application, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores are generally consistent, except for report 5's slight elevation in securityRisk.\n- I would assign the following scores:\n  - **malware:** 0\n  - **obfuscated:** 0\n  - **risk:** 0 (or at most 0.05 if conservative)\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and the analysis provided.",
