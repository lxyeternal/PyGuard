{
  "purpose": "This script is for configuring the setup of a Python package named 'web3_eth' with dependencies and metadata, primarily used for Ethereum blockchain interactions.",
  "sources": "File input includes the README.md file for long_description; package data files; external dependencies listed in install_requires and extras_require.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or used; no network communication, file writing, or environment variable manipulation within this script.",
  "flows": "The script reads the README.md file to set long_description, processes dependency lists for installation, and passes configuration parameters to setup(), with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated sections, or suspicious logic. The code appears standard for a setup.py file, with normal dependency declarations and package configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools, defines dependency groups, reads a README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for a package setup. No code injection, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. No external network calls or sensitive data handling are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script without malicious intent. It contains no suspicious behavior or security risks based on the content analyzed.",
