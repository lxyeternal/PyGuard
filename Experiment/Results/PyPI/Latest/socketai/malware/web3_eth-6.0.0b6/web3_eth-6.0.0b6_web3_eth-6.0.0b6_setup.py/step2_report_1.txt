  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup.py for 'web3_eth'.\n- Findings: No malicious code, no dynamic or obfuscated code, dependencies are static and well-defined.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a conventional setup.py with no suspicious activity. The malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar setup configuration.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; the script is a typical setup script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Again, a standard setup for 'web3_eth'.\n- Findings: Static data, no code injection, no obfuscated code.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as a benign setup script.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar setup configuration.\n- Findings: No suspicious patterns, no obfuscated code, dependencies are standard.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Valid conclusion; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard package setup.\n- Findings: No dynamic code, no obfuscation, dependencies are typical.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely static configuration for packaging a Python project.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; no code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero; the script is standard and well-structured.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n**Risk score:** 0 — standard package setup poses no security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup script is a legitimate, standard configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. All scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the content of all reports.",
