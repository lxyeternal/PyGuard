{
  "purpose": "The code defines a framework for managing and processing RPC methods within the web3_eth module, including input munging, method selection, request formatting, and handling deprecated methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from method calls (input_munger), configuration attributes (json_rpc_method, mungers), and potentially external data through formatters. No direct external data input sources like network or environment variables are present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include method calls that send requests via retrieve_caller_fn, and formatters that process request and response data. However, no untrusted external data is explicitly handled or written to insecure outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mungers (input_munger), then via process_params to generate request method and parameters, which are then formatted and used in network requests via retrieve_caller_fn.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes standard use of dynamic features such as callable formatters and method selectors, but no suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are evident. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of a method management system for an RPC client library. It handles input normalization, dynamic method selection, and request formatting. No external data sources or sinks show signs of malicious activity. The use of warnings for deprecated methods is standard practice. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs and adheres to normal coding patterns for such a library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured part of a web3 RPC client framework with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It is unlikely to contain malware or security risks based on the static analysis of the code provided.",
