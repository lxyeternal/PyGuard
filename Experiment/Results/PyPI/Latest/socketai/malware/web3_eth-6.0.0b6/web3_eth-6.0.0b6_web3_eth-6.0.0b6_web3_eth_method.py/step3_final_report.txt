  "purpose": "Provides an abstraction layer for web3 Ethereum RPC methods, managing input formatting, method selection, and response formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, method configuration, request and response formatters, dynamic callables for method and formatter selection.",
  "sinks": "Method invocation via retrieve_caller_fn, request formatting, response formatting, potential dynamic execution if callables are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> mungers -> request formatters -> method selection -> RPC call -> response formatters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic callables for method and formatter selection, which could be exploited if malicious callables are injected; no actual malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a web3 RPC method handler, with input munging, method selection, and formatting. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation are detected. The dynamic features, while potentially exploitable if untrusted code supplies malicious callables, are typical for extensible libraries. The static code itself shows no signs of sabotage, backdoors, or obfuscation. The scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment, though the potential risk introduced by dynamic callables warrants a slight increase in the malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary concern is the potential misuse of dynamic callables if untrusted code is used, which should be monitored. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal, with a moderate potential risk due to dynamic features.",
