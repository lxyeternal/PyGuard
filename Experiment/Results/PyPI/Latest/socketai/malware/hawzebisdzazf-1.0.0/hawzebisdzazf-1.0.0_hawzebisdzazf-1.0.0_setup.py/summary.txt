  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior with high security implications. The external URL and the data collection process are suspicious and potentially harmful. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting high malware and security risk levels. The obfuscation is minimal but the URL's suspicious nature justifies a moderate score. Overall, this package exhibits malicious supply chain behavior and should be flagged as high risk."
