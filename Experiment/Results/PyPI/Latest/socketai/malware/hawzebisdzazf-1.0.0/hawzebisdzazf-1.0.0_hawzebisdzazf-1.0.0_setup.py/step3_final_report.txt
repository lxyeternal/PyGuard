{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that, during package setup, collects system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrates it by sending an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL, without user consent.",
  "sources": "The system info variables: hostname, cwd, username, accessed via socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser()",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call to 'https://rqlzzdjnxe0zmyqf1ibj2sl4lvrpfh36.oastify.com' with collected data as parameters",
  "flows": "Source variables (hostname, cwd, username) -> requests.get() call with these variables as URL parameters during the run() method of CustomInstall",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration occurs during package installation without user notification; URL is suspicious and obfuscated; no legitimate reason for transmitting system info at this stage",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the run() method of the install command to perform standard installation, then immediately collects system info and sends it to a suspicious external URL via an HTTP GET request. The URL appears obfuscated and is used for covert data exfiltration. No other malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The behavior is characteristic of malicious supply chain attacks, aiming to gather system data without user consent. The external request is made during setup, which is atypical and indicates malicious intent. The URL's suspicious nature and the covert exfiltration strongly suggest malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports—malware around 0.75-0.9, security risk 0.8-0.9, obfuscation 0.2-0.8—are justified, with a slight preference for higher malware and risk scores due to the covert exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration during package installation, indicating malicious behavior with high security implications. The external URL and the data collection process are suspicious and potentially harmful. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, reflecting high malware and security risk levels. The obfuscation is minimal but the URL's suspicious nature justifies a moderate score. Overall, this package exhibits malicious supply chain behavior and should be flagged as high risk.",
