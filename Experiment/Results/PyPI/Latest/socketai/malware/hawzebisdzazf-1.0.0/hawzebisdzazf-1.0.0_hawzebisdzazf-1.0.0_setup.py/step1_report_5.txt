{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation process that collects system information and sends it to an external server during package installation.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() — these are used to gather hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() — sends collected system data to an external server (https://rqlzzdjnxe0zmyqf1ibj2sl4lvrpfh36.oastify.com).",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are collected and directly sent via the requests.get() call to an external domain, representing a data exfiltration flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a custom install class to perform network activity during package installation without explicit user consent. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and external to typical package behavior. No validation or user notification is present. Hardcoded URL and collection of hostname, cwd, username without safeguards are concerning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for setup and system info collection. It defines a custom install class that overrides the run method, which first calls the original run method. It then collects hostname, current working directory, and username. These details are bundled into a dictionary and sent via an HTTP GET request to an external URL. This behavior occurs during package installation, indicating potential data exfiltration. The URL is suspicious and likely used for malicious purposes such as tracking or data theft. No user notification or consent is provided, and the external server is not related to typical package functions.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py code performs covert data collection and transmission during package installation, indicating malicious intent. It exfiltrates system information to an external server without user consent, constituting a security risk. The behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks aimed at user tracking or data theft.",
