{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup script for a Python package, which, upon installation, performs an HTTP GET request to an external server, transmitting system information.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()) during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The external HTTP request (requests.get) sends collected system data to an external domain, which could be malicious if the server is controlled by an attacker.",
  "flows": "System information (hostname, cwd, username) is collected during installation and then sent via an HTTP GET request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically transmits system information during package installation without user consent or obvious legitimate purpose. The external domain appears obfuscated and suspicious. The code is embedded within a setup script, which is a common vector for malicious behavior in supply chain attacks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for setup and system info collection, but overrides the install command to include a request to an external server. It collects hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data to a suspicious URL. There is no apparent legitimate reason for this data exfiltration during package installation, which indicates malicious intent or at least malicious intent possibility. The URL is obfuscated, and the purpose of transmitting this data is unclear, further raising suspicion. The code executes during the package install process, which is a common method for malicious payload delivery in supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains malicious behavior: it secretly collects and exfiltrates system information to an external domain during package installation. The behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating this package could be used for data theft or system reconnaissance as part of a supply chain attack.",
