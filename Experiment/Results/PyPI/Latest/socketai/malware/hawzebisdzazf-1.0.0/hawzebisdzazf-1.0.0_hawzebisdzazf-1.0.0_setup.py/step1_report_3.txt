  "purpose": "Setup script that installs a Python package and executes custom post-install behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during installation.",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to an external server upon installation.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system (hostname, cwd, username) flows directly into an HTTP request to a remote server during the install process.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior: data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, hardcoded external URL, no validation or user notification, executing network request in setup script.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py extends the standard install process by adding a step that collects system info (hostname, cwd, username) and sends it to an external URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, potentially malicious. The external URL is obfuscated but appears to be an external domain possibly used for command and control or tracking. The code uses requests to make a GET request during install, which is unusual for a package installation process and could be used for malicious purposes. No user notification or opt-in mechanism is present, raising privacy concerns. No other suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs data collection and sends it to a remote server during installation, indicative of malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. This is suspicious for a package intended for public use, as it could be used for tracking or data theft. The overall security risk is high.",
