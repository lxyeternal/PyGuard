{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with custom installation behavior that sends system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), os.getcwd(), getpass.getuser() - gathering system hostname, current working directory, and username.",
  "sinks": "requests.get() - sending collected data to a remote server via an HTTP GET request.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows directly into the requests.get() call as URL parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes an external network request during installation, sending potentially sensitive system info without user consent or transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom install command that, upon execution, collects hostname, current directory, and username. Immediately after installation, it makes a GET request to a suspicious URL, passing the collected system information as parameters. This behavior could be used to exfiltrate environment details without user knowledge. No other malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic is present. The external request could facilitate tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs an apparently benign package setup but includes a hidden data exfiltration mechanism that sends system details to an external server during installation, indicating malicious or at least privacy-invasive intent. The behavior is suspicious and could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
