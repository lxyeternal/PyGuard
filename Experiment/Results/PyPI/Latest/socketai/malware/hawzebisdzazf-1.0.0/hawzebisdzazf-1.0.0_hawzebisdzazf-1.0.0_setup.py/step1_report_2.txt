  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup process with a custom installation step that executes additional code during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system hostname, current working directory, and username during the custom install run.",
  "sinks": "A network request is made to an external URL with collected system information as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "During installation, system info (hostname, cwd, username) flows from source (system info collection) to sink (requests.get call to external URL).",
  "anomalies": "The code sends system information to an external URL without user consent or obvious purpose, which is suspicious. The URL is obfuscated and suspicious. The request is made during installation, which could be malicious or tracking behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup-related modules and other standard libraries. It defines a custom install class that, upon running, gathers system info: hostname, current working directory, and username. It then makes an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, obfuscated domain with this info as URL parameters. The setup() function uses this custom class for installation. The network call during installation indicates potential data exfiltration or malicious tracking. The URL is suspicious and obfuscated, indicating malicious intent or malicious tracking. No legitimate purpose for sending system info during package installation is evident. The code does not perform any other security-sensitive operations or contain obfuscation beyond the URL.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious due to its behavior of exfiltrating system information to an external, obfuscated URL during package installation. It indicates malicious or tracking intent, constituting malicious behavior. The code's purpose appears to be covert data collection, which is a security risk.",
