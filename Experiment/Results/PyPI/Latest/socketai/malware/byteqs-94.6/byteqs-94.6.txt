      "conclusion": "The code executes an external function during setup, posing a significant security concern. While no evidence of malicious payloads is present in the snippet, this pattern is often used maliciously. Therefore, the malware score should be set around 0.6, and the security risk score around 0.7, reflecting the potential for arbitrary code execution during installation."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. While it lacks destructive payloads or obfuscation, its behavior warrants classification as malicious activity. The malware score should be high (around 0.7-0.8), and the security risk score should be similarly elevated due to privacy invasion and covert data transmission."
