  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then encode MAC addresses and send this data to multiple external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system-specific network info, random.randint() generating a number, base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending HTTP requests to external domains with system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info is gathered (hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses), MAC addresses are base64-encoded, then data is sent via GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "The code communicates with three suspicious external URLs that appear obfuscated and potentially malicious; it encodes MAC addresses and sends them without user consent; no validation or user warning; exception handling is very broad (silently ignores errors).",
  "analysis": "The script collects system identifiers (hostname, username, current directory) and MAC addresses across different OS platforms. It encodes MAC addresses and constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains with these data as URL parameters. It makes network requests to these domains, which could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or exfiltration. The URLs appear malicious or at least suspicious, as they are obfuscated and hosted on questionable domains. There is no user consent or notification. The code could facilitate privacy invasion or data exfiltration. No signs of obfuscation or code concealment within the code itself, but the external communication is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects sensitive system information and transmits it to potentially malicious domains without user knowledge, indicating malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. It should be treated as potentially malware due to its suspicious URL destinations and unconsented data transmission.",
