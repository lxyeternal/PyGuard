{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) and exfiltrates it via HTTP GET requests to multiple suspicious external URLs, indicating potential malicious data theft.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (via subprocess calls), and the URL parameters constructed with these data.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls sending data to external domains, potentially leading to data leakage or exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and MAC addresses) are encoded and included as URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling suppresses errors, and the URLs are suspicious and hardcoded, indicating covert data exfiltration. MAC addresses are base64-encoded, possibly to obfuscate data.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system data and transmits it to untrusted domains without user consent, with no obfuscation beyond base64 encoding. The external URLs are suspicious, and the silent exception handling could hide failures. No malicious payloads or destructive actions are present, but the behavior aligns with privacy-invasive data exfiltration. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques, and the data collection is consistent across platforms. The main concern is covertly sending system info to potentially malicious domains, which constitutes a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, indicating malicious intent. While it lacks destructive payloads or obfuscation, its behavior warrants classification as malicious activity. The malware score should be high (around 0.7-0.8), and the security risk score should be similarly elevated due to privacy invasion and covert data transmission.",
