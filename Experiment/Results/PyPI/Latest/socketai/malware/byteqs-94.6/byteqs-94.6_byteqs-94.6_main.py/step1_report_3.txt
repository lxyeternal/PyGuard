  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it via HTTP GET requests to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), current directory (os.getcwd()), username (getpass.getuser()), MAC addresses (get_mac_addresses()), and generates a random number (random.randint()).",
  "sinks": "Constructs URLs with collected data and sends HTTP requests using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> encodes MAC addresses -> builds URL with parameters -> sends HTTP request to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Uses obfuscated external URLs (unusual domain names). Encodes MAC addresses in base64 before transmission. No user input validation or filtering. No explicit data validation or encryption for the data sent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system info, including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to obscure their content. The data is sent via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs, which appear suspicious due to their unusual domain names and structure. The code does not perform any apparent malicious actions like executing external code or damaging files, but it exfiltrates system info without user consent, which is privacy-invasive. The use of hardcoded URLs and encoding methods suggests potential malicious intent or at least privacy violations. No obfuscated code techniques are present; the code is straightforward. The URLs point to domains that are not recognized and could be malicious or part of a command-and-control infrastructure, making this potentially malicious or privacy-invasive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects and exfiltrates system information to suspicious external servers without user consent. It appears designed for covert data collection, potentially malicious, but does not execute harmful system commands or directly damage files. Its primary risk is privacy violation and data exfiltration.",
