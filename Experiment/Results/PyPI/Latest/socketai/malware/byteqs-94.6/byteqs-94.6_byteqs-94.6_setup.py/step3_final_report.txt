{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, after performing the standard installation, imports and executes the 'main()' function from 'main.py'.",
  "sources": "Importing and executing 'main()' during the 'run()' method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' during installation, which can run arbitrary code with system privileges.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run()' method calls 'install.run(self)' followed by 'main()' from 'main.py'.",
  "anomalies": "Executing external code ('main()') unconditionally during setup, which is unusual and potentially dangerous.",
  "analysis": "The code pattern involves executing 'main()' from 'main.py' during the installation process, which is a known security risk if 'main()' contains malicious code. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The pattern allows arbitrary code execution at install time, which can be exploited for malicious purposes. The scores across reports (malware 0.3-0.5, risk 0.4-0.6) are reasonable but could be slightly increased given the potential severity. The overall behavior warrants caution, especially without inspecting 'main.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes an external function during setup, posing a significant security concern. While no evidence of malicious payloads is present in the snippet, this pattern is often used maliciously. Therefore, the malware score should be set around 0.6, and the security risk score around 0.7, reflecting the potential for arbitrary code execution during installation.",
