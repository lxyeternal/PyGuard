  "conclusion": "The code executes an external function during setup, posing a significant security concern. While no evidence of malicious payloads is present in the snippet, this pattern is often used maliciously. Therefore, the malware score should be set around 0.6, and the security risk score around 0.7, reflecting the potential for arbitrary code execution during installation."
