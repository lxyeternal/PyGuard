  "purpose": "Setuptools-based setup script that installs the package and runs a custom command during installation, which executes the main() function from main.py.",
  "sources": "Importing main and executing main() in the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() function from main.py during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method calls main() from main.py, executing code that could be malicious or harmless.",
  "anomalies": "Custom installation command executes a potentially arbitrary main() function during install. No explicit obfuscation, but executing code during setup can be suspicious if main() performs unexpected actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command 'CrazyInstallStrat' that, after running the standard install process, imports and executes main() from main.py. This behavior is unusual because it executes code during package installation, which can be used maliciously to run arbitrary code on the user's system. The setup script itself appears straightforward, but the execution of main() during install warrants caution, especially if main() performs unexpected or malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected. The code's structure is standard with an atypical post-install action.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes main() from main.py during installation, which could potentially run malicious code if main() contains harmful instructions. The rest of the code appears normal. This behavior warrants caution because running arbitrary code during package installation is a security concern.",
