{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to implement a utility function for processing user input and performing some basic data manipulation, likely related to a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via input() function, possibly reads environment variables, and loads data from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses data in data processing functions, potentially outputs data via print(), writes to files or network, or executes commands.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from user/environment sources, then processed through functions, and potentially outputted or sent over network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, unusual variable names, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python functions and libraries. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden network activity. The structure is clear, with input handling, data processing, and output operations, consistent with typical application code. Absence of suspicious patterns or obfuscated constructs suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate application logic with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
