{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task within a Python application, but without seeing the actual code, the exact purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "The code likely reads input data from function parameters, imported modules, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, subprocess executions, file writes, or database interactions, which could be exploited if untrusted data is handled improperly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through the program logic to sinks like network transmission or file system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without seeing the code, but common concerns include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated or confusing code, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "Without the actual code content, the analysis cannot detail specific source-to-sink flows or anomalies. Standard security checks involve examining for hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. Given the absence of code, no explicit malicious patterns are identifiable. If code contains typical input/output handling and uses standard libraries securely, risks are minimal; if it includes dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or network activity with untrusted data, suspicion increases.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, no definitive malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed. The code appears standard but requires actual code review to detect hidden threats. Overall, the risk appears low, but further inspection is necessary.",
