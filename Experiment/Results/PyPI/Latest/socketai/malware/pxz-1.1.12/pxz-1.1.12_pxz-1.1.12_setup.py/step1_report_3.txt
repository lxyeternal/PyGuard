{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process that includes a custom installation command to collect and send system information to an external server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information from os.uname(), os.getcwd(), os.path.expanduser('~'), datetime.now(), and makes an HTTP request to an external IP API and a remote server.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data (system info and public IP) is sent via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address (http://35.170.187.220:8080/).",
  "flows": "The system information is gathered, formatted into URL parameters, and sent through an HTTP request during the custom install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs unsolicited data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, which is unusual and suspicious. Hardcoded server URL and automatic data transmission are typical signs of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a custom install command that, upon execution, collects detailed system info including public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It then constructs a URL with these parameters and sends a GET request to an external server. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, without user notification or explicit consent. Such behavior resembles malicious activity, as it exfiltrates user system data to an external server. No other benign purpose is evident, and the data transmission is hidden within the installation process. The server address is hardcoded and external, indicating potential malicious intent or backdoor functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting and transmitting system information to an external server during installation without user consent. The behavior aligns with typical data exfiltration or backdoor activity, indicating high malicious potential.",
