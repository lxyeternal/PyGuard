{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package that, upon installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the network (https://api.ipify.org and the specified server URL), system calls (os.uname()), environment variables (os.path.expanduser), and current system state (current directory, hostname, current time).",
  "sinks": "The code sends data via an HTTP request to an external server (http://35.170.187.220:8080/) with system info embedded in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Input sources include the public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp; these are combined into URL parameters and sent via an HTTP request to the specified server.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically collects system info during package installation and transmits it to a hardcoded external server without user consent or explicit permission, which is suspicious. It also constructs a URL with system info parameters, potentially enabling data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script modifies the standard installation process by adding a custom command that, during installation, gathers sensitive system data, including public IP, hostname, and directory paths. It then sends this data to an external IP address via an HTTP GET request. This behavior is embedded within the setup script, making it likely to execute during package installation, which could be considered malicious or privacy-invasive. There are no obfuscated code patterns, and the network activity appears intentional. The data collection and transmission are automatic and hardcoded, indicating potentially malicious intent or privacy violation. No other suspicious or malicious code like backdoors, privilege escalation, or obfuscated behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious potential by secretly collecting and transmitting system information to an external server during package installation. This behavior violates user privacy and could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. The package should be considered risky for distribution or installation.",
