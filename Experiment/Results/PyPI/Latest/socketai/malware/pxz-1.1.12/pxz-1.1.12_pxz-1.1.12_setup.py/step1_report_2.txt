{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom setup process that, during installation, collects system information and sends it to a remote server.",
  "sources": "Reads data from URL (https://api.ipify.org) for public IP, system calls for hostname and current directory, and system time from datetime.now().",
  "sinks": "Sends collected data via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://35.170.187.220:8080/).",
  "flows": "System info is gathered from multiple sources, formatted into URL parameters, and transmitted to the remote server via an HTTP request during installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code actively collects potentially sensitive system information (public IP, hostname, directories, current time) and transmits it to an external IP address without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The script hooks into the package installation process to execute code that gathers system details, including external IP, hostname, directories, and current time. It then constructs a URL with these details as query parameters and sends an HTTP GET request to a specific external IP address. This behavior is embedded in a custom installation class, indicating intentional malicious or privacy-invading activity. No obfuscated code or complex hiding techniques are present. The code operates transparently in its current form but performs covert data exfiltration during install.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious in intent, collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system information without user consent. It is designed to run automatically during package installation, likely for tracking or malicious surveillance purposes.",
