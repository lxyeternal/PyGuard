{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process for a Python package that collects system information and sends it to a remote server during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from the network (URL requests to fetch public IP and send data), environment variables (os.uname(), os.path.expanduser, os.getcwd()), and system time (datetime.now()).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://35.170.187.220:8080/). The URL construction includes system info as query parameters, leading to potential data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Sources include URL requests for IP and system info; data flows into the constructed URL; the URL request acts as a sink where data is transmitted to the server, completing the source-to-sink flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically sends system information during installation without user consent or obvious purpose; it connects to a specific IP address, which could be malicious or untrusted; no error handling for malicious interference; the server IP is hardcoded. These behaviors suggest potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that triggers system info collection during package installation. It gathers public IP, hostname, home directory, current directory, and timestamp. It then constructs a URL with these parameters and sends a GET request to a remote IP address. The purpose appears to be stealth data collection or exfiltration, especially since it operates automatically upon installation, which is unusual for benign packages. The server IP is hardcoded, with no indication of user consent or transparency. The code's behavior aligns with malicious data theft or backdoor functionality, especially given the lack of documentation or warning. No obfuscation or malware-like code snippets are present outside this behavior, but the activity itself is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This package secretly collects and transmits system information to a remote server during installation, which is indicative of malicious behavior or a supply chain attack. The behavior is stealthy, lacks transparency, and could be used for tracking or data theft. It warrants suspicion and caution before use.",
