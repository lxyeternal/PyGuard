{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (public IP, hostname, directories, timestamp) during package installation and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded external server.",
  "sources": "URLError during URL requests, os.uname() for hostname, os.path.expanduser('~') for home directory, os.getcwd() for current directory, datetime.now() for timestamp.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request to external server with system info parameters, network transmission of sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Source: data collection functions (urlopen, os.uname, os.getcwd, expanduser, datetime); Sink: urlopen request to external server with system info parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Automatic data exfiltration during package installation without user consent, hardcoded server IP, no user notification, straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, when triggered during package setup, collects sensitive system info and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a fixed external IP address. The data includes public IP, hostname, user directory, current directory, and timestamp. The process occurs silently during installation, indicating potential malicious intent. The code is transparent, with no obfuscation, and the network activity is direct. The behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration or backdoor activity, posing significant privacy and security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.75-0.9, security risk ~0.8-0.9, obfuscation 0) are appropriate; given the clear malicious activity, the malware score could be increased to 1.0, and the risk score to 1.0 for maximum severity. The reasoning in the reports is consistent and justified based on the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs covert data exfiltration during installation, representing highly malicious activity. The behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially harmful, warranting high malware and security risk scores. The code should be flagged as malicious or suspicious for further review or removal from distribution channels.",
