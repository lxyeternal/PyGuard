  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input from user inputs, environment variables, file I/O, network connections, and code snippets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as user input or environment variables flow into processing functions; outputs are sent to network, files, or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; code appears benign or incomplete.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious activity based on the provided information. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign assessments. Limited or missing code snippets lead to cautious confidence levels (~0.2-0.4), which are appropriate. The overall evaluation suggests minimal security risk, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. The supply chain risk from this dependency is minimal.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
