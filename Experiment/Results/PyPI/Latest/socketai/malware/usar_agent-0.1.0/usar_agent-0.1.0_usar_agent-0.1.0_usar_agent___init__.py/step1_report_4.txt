  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but due to lack of context and code content, the exact purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data primarily from environment variables and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network connections or written to files, but specific sink locations are not clearly demonstrated in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment variables or function arguments may flow into network operations or data storage functions, but explicit flow paths are not fully visible.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are observed. The code does not contain obfuscated or intentionally confusing elements. No unusual behavior or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for typical security issues including hardcoded secrets, malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The snippet appears standard and does not exhibit anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security risks. No indicators of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. Given the limited snippet, confidence remains moderate, but based on available data, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be standard utility code with no malicious intent, obfuscated elements, or security vulnerabilities identified. Further context could improve certainty, but overall risk is low.",
