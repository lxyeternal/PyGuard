{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be standard Python with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent, handling environment variables and input in a typical manner.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, data read from external sources",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage through environment variables or input handling, but no unsafe or malicious operations observed",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input functions to processing or output, with no suspicious or malicious operations detected",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns identified; code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code is simple, handles environment variables and input without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The confidence in benignity is high (0.9). The security risk is minimal (0.2), reflecting limited potential for misuse given the context. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the code appears safe for use.",
