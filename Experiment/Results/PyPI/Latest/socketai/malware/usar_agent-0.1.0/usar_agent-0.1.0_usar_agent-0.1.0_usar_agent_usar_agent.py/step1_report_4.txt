  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be intended for general functionality, possibly related to data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not clearly defined; the code does not explicitly read from files, network, or environment variables. There are no obvious data input functions or data streams.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls; however, specific sink functions are not identified in the code provided.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows, as the code does not show data being received from external sources or passed into sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or obfuscated code are present. The code uses standard language features without apparent malicious intent or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, utilizing common libraries and functions. No suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The structure and formatting are consistent with normal Python coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be benign and safe for use. Confidence is high that there is no malware or obfuscation present.",
