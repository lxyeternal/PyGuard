{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation command that intentionally aborts the package installation process by raising an exception with a message directing users to a suspicious URL, indicating malicious sabotage of the installation process.",
  "sources": "The run() method of the AbortInstall class, which is invoked during package installation via setuptools' cmdclass override.",
  "sinks": "The raised exception SystehmExit (intended as SystemExit) with a message, which halts the installation process and displays the malicious URL.",
  "flows": "During installation, the overridden run() method is called, which raises the exception leading to installation abort and message display.",
  "anomalies": "The exception class is misspelled as SystehmExit instead of SystemExit; the URL http://evilpackage.fatezero.org/ is suspicious; the repeated message and the override of the install command are unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary behavior is to prevent installation by raising an exception with a malicious URL, which is a sabotage tactic. The misspelling of SystemExit as SystehmExit appears to be an obfuscation attempt or a typo. The setup correctly overrides the install command to execute this behavior. The malicious URL and the intent to disrupt installation indicate malicious sabotage. The typo could be an evasion tactic, but it also causes a runtime error if executed as-is. The overall behavior aligns with malicious intent, aiming to mislead or prevent users from installing the package. The high confidence scores (~0.9) reflect the malicious sabotage, and the malware score (~0.8) is justified by the sabotage and redirection, not by payloads. The obfuscation score (~0.2) accounts for the typo, which may be an obfuscation tactic or a simple mistake. The security risk score (~0.9) is high due to the sabotage and malicious redirection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious in intent, designed to sabotage installation and redirect users to a suspicious URL. The typo in the exception class suggests possible obfuscation but does not negate the malicious behavior. The scores of high malware and security risk are appropriate, with a low obfuscation score reflecting the minor typo. Overall, this package should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
