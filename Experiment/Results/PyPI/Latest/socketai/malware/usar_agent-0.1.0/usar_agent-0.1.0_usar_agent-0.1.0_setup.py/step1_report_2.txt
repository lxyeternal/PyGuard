{
  "purpose": "Override the setuptools install command to abort installation with a message, potentially as a fake or malicious package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.rst file during setup to include a long description.",
  "targets": "The code does not contain direct data sinks; it primarily prevents installation.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' during setup; raising an exception during install command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class raises an exception with a suspicious message and links to a potentially malicious website; the URL and message suggest malicious intent. The code attempts to prevent installation, which could be a sabotage tactic.",
  "analysis": "The script redefines the installation process to immediately abort, displaying a message with links to 'http://evilpackage.fatezero.org/'—a suspicious domain. The message seems designed to deceive or dissuade users from installing this package, possibly indicating malicious intent. The use of a malicious URL and the intentional interruption of setup suggest sabotage or malicious behavior. The code otherwise appears normal for a setup script, but the core purpose of aborting install with a suspicious message is itself a malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to prevent installation and includes references to a suspicious URL, indicating malicious intent or sabotage. It may be part of a malicious package aimed at disrupting or misleading users.",
