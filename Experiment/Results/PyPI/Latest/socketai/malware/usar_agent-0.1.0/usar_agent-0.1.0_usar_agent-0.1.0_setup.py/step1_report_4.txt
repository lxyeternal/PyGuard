{
  "purpose": "To prevent installation of the package 'usar_agent' and redirect users to a potentially malicious website.",
  "sources": "The run() method of the AbortInstall class, which raises an exception to abort installation.",
  "sinks": "The SystehmExit exception in the run() method which halts installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run() method is invoked, raising SystehmExit and stopping the process.",
  "anomalies": "The code raises a misspelled exception 'SystehmExit' instead of 'SystemExit', indicating potential obfuscation or typo; the repeated URL suggests intentional deception.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the 'install' command to prevent installation by raising an exception. The exception intended is 'SystemExit', but it is misspelled as 'SystehmExit', which could be a typo or deliberate obfuscation. The message warns users and directs them to a suspicious URL (http://evilpackage.fatezero.org/), implying malicious intent to discourage or manipulate installation behavior. No other malicious or suspicious code is present; the primary purpose is to sabotage the installation process with misleading messages and a malicious URL.",
  "conclusion": "The package is designed to prevent installation by raising an exception that halts the process, directing users to a malicious URL. The misspelling of 'SystemExit' suggests potential obfuscation or error, but the overall behavior indicates malicious intent aimed at sabotage and misleading users.",
