{
  "purpose": "To prevent the installation of the package 'usar_agent' and redirect users to a suspicious website, effectively acting as a malicious abort mechanism.",
  "sources": "The run() method in the AbortInstall class, which is invoked during installation and raises an exception to halt installation.",
  "sinks": "The raise SystehmExit statement in the run() method, which terminates the installation process with a custom message.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'install' command triggers the AbortInstall.run() method, which interrupts the flow and outputs the message with links to a malicious website.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a misspelled exception 'SystehmExit' (likely intended to be 'SystemExit'), which indicates possible obfuscation or typo to evade detection; the immediate abort and referral to a suspicious URL.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that overrides the standard installation process to raise an exception and abort the installation. The exception used, 'SystehmExit', appears to be a typo, which may be intentional or obfuscation. The message instructs users to visit a malicious URL, indicating malicious intent to mislead or harm users. The setup process is otherwise standard, with no other suspicious dependencies or behaviors. The code does not include any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads beyond the installation abort message.",
  "conclusion": "The package intentionally blocks installation and directs users to a malicious website, indicating malicious behavior. The typo in 'SystehmExit' could be an attempt to evade detection or obfuscation. Overall, this code appears malicious as it seeks to prevent legitimate installation and mislead users.",
