  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, network connections.",
  "sinks": "Data leaks, system modifications, network transmissions, environment variable access, file operations.",
  "flows": "Sources involving input or data flow into sinks such as network or file operations, possibly via dynamic execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, missing code snippets, unusual imports, or suspicious patterns without concrete malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution features, raising suspicion but lacking concrete malicious actions. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are evident. The absence of code in some reports limits certainty. Scores are generally consistent with the described features; Report 1's moderate malware score (0.3) and high obfuscation (0.7) are justified given the suspicion. Other reports correctly reflect benign or insufficient data scenarios. Slight adjustment to Report 1's malware score to 0.2 could improve accuracy, but current scores are acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low to moderate suspicion primarily in Report 1 due to obfuscation and dynamic features. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed. Scores are consistent with the evidence; minor adjustments could be made for precision, but current values are reasonable.",
