  "conclusion": "The code is a typical PyArmor-protected, obfuscated script used for licensing or anti-tampering. While the obfuscation and encrypted payload could conceal malicious behavior, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in the static analysis. The scores should reflect a cautious stance, with low to moderate malware suspicion and high obfuscation. The overall security risk remains low but warrants further dynamic analysis if the source is untrusted."
