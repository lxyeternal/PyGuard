{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ object from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely used for obfuscation or licensing enforcement.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import is static and does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a trial version comment and import of a runtime module suggests obfuscation or licensing mechanisms, but no malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, possibly part of an obfuscation or licensing enforcement framework (Pyarmor). The comment indicates it's a trial version. No suspicious or malicious code, no data leaks, and no suspicious control flow. The code is minimal and does not perform any operations beyond importing a runtime object.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement associated with code obfuscation or licensing. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
