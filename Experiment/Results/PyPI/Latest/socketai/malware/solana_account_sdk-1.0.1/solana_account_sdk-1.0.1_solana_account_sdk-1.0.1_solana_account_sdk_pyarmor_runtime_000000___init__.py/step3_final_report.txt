{
  "purpose": "This code imports __pyarmor__ from a local module __pyarmor_runtime__, likely for licensing or obfuscation purposes related to Pyarmor protection.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .pyarmor_runtime, which is a local module in the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statement to the usage of __pyarmor__, but no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating Pyarmor 8.5.11 (trial) suggests obfuscation or licensing enforcement; no suspicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with a comment about Pyarmor licensing. No malicious functions, network activity, or data handling are present. The import of __pyarmor__ is typical in protected codebases. The comment indicates use of Pyarmor for obfuscation/licensing, not malicious intent. The malware score is 0, as there are no indicators of malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is moderate (~0.6), reflecting the use of obfuscation tools. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import used in obfuscated or licensed Python packages employing Pyarmor. There is no malicious activity, backdoor, or security vulnerability present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
