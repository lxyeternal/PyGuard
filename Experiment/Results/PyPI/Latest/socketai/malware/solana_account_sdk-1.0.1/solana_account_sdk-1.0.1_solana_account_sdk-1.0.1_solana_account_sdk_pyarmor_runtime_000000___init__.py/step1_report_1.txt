{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely related to code obfuscation or licensing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or untrusted data handling points",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicating Pyarmor trial version, which may suggest licensing or obfuscation; no malicious activity or backdoors evident",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a single attribute from a local module named pyarmor_runtime. The comment indicates the usage of Pyarmor 8.5.11 (trial version). There are no suspicious functions, data handling, or external network interactions. The presence of a license comment and import statement aligns with standard obfuscation or licensing practices, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a protected or obfuscated package using Pyarmor, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The comment suggests licensing or trial version usage, not malicious activity.",
