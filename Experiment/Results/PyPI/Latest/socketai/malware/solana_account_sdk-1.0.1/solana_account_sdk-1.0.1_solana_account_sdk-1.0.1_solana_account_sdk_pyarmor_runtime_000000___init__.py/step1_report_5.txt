  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ attribute from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely for obfuscation or licensing enforcement purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing paths involving untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard import statement associated with code obfuscation or licensing tools; no unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named pyarmor_runtime, which is typically associated with the PyArmor protection tool used to obfuscate or license Python code. The import does not involve data input, network activity, or other potentially malicious actions. The presence of version and date info suggests this is part of a protected or compiled script. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement related to the PyArmor protection system. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The presence of such a line is common in protected Python applications.",
