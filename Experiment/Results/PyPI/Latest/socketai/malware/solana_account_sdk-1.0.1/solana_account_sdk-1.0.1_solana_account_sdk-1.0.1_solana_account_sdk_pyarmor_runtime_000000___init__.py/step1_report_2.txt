{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ runtime module, likely for code obfuscation or licensing management.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow observed",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a Pyarmor version comment indicating obfuscation/trial status; no suspicious or malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement from a relative module named pyarmor_runtime, with a comment indicating the use of Pyarmor version 8.5.11 (trial). The comment suggests the code is protected by Pyarmor, which is a legitimate code obfuscation tool. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The import appears standard and straightforward, with no unusual code structures or obfuscation beyond the license comment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement associated with Pyarmor obfuscation and licensing, with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a protected or obfuscated codebase, but the snippet itself does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
