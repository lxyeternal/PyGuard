{
  "purpose": "Import the __pyarmor__ object from the pyarmor_runtime module, likely used for code obfuscation or runtime protection.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pyarmor_runtime",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential leaks",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink observable in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating use of Pyarmor trial version; minimal code structure; no suspicious code behavior or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a component from a module named pyarmor_runtime, which is associated with the Pyarmor obfuscation tool. This suggests the code is part of an obfuscated or protected package. There are no functions, data processing, or external data handling shown. The comment indicates use of a trial version of Pyarmor. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple import statement associated with code obfuscation or runtime protection, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It likely forms part of an obfuscated package.",
