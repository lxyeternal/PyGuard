{
  "purpose": "The code generates a Solana account from a mnemonic phrase, formatting and returning keypair information.",
  "sources": "Input: user-specified mnemonic length; internal: generated mnemonic via Mnemonic library",
  "sinks": "Keypair generation, converting seed to keypair, printing debug info",
  "flows": "Mnemonic input -> seed derivation -> keypair creation -> data formatting -> optional debug print",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network calls, no hidden backdoors or malicious code behaviors. Use of print statements for debugging is common but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script generates mnemonic phrases, derives seeds, and creates keypairs using established libraries. No code appears to send data externally, store secrets insecurely, or perform harmful actions. The debug print could leak information if enabled but is optional and controlled via _debug parameter. The import of potentially sensitive libraries is standard for cryptographic operations. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard cryptographic account generation for Solana blockchain. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. No malicious data flow or suspicious activities are observed.",
