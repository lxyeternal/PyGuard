  "purpose": "Generate a Solana wallet keypair from a mnemonic phrase, optionally using a derivation path, and format account details.",
  "sources": "Mnemonic generation, bip39 seed derivation, keypair creation via solana.rpc.api.Keypair, optional debug print of account info.",
  "sinks": "Output of mnemonic, public key, address, key bytes; debug print potentially exposing sensitive info if enabled.",
  "flows": "Mnemonic input -> seed derivation -> keypair creation -> formatted data output; debug print outputs sensitive info if _debug=True.",
  "anomalies": "Use of debug print which can leak sensitive data if enabled; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard cryptographic procedures for wallet generation, with no malicious code or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the debug print, which could leak private info if misused, but this is a common and manageable risk. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential for accidental info leakage. The libraries used are reputable, and the logic is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for generating Solana wallet accounts from mnemonics. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The only security consideration is the debug print, which should be disabled in production environments to prevent accidental leakage. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
