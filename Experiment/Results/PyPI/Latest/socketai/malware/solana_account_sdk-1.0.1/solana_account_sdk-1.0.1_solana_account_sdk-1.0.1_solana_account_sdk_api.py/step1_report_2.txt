  "purpose": "Generate and format a Solana account keypair from a mnemonic seed phrase, supporting derivation paths and debug output.",
  "sources": "Mnemonic input generated internally, seed derived from mnemonic phrase.",
  "sinks": "Keypair creation from seed, JSON serialization for debug output.",
  "flows": "Mnemonic generation -> seed derivation -> keypair creation -> formatted data output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code generates mnemonics and keypairs but does not transmit or store sensitive data externally. Debug print could leak key information if enabled.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a mnemonic seed phrase (using 'mnemonic' library), derives a seed, and creates a Solana keypair via the 'solana' SDK. It supports derivation paths for hierarchical deterministic wallets. The 'format_mnemonic' function can output detailed keypair info when debugging is enabled, which could expose sensitive data if debug mode is used improperly. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication to unknown domains, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions rely on standard libraries and do not include obfuscated or malicious code. Overall, the code appears intended for legitimate wallet generation and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is for generating and formatting Solana keypairs from mnemonics. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks in its current form. The only concern is that debug mode could inadvertently leak sensitive key data if used improperly. No malicious intent or sabotage is evident.",
