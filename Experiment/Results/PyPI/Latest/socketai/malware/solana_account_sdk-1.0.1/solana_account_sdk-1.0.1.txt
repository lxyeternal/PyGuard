      "conclusion": "The code is a typical PyArmor-protected, obfuscated script used for licensing or anti-tampering. While the obfuscation and encrypted payload could conceal malicious behavior, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in the static analysis. The scores should reflect a cautious stance, with low to moderate malware suspicion and high obfuscation. The overall security risk remains low but warrants further dynamic analysis if the source is untrusted."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for generating Solana wallet accounts from mnemonics. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The only security consideration is the debug print, which should be disabled in production environments to prevent accidental leakage. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose."
