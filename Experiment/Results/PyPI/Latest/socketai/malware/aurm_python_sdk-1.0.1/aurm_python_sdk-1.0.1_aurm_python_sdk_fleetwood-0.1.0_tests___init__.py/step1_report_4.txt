  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python package initializer that imports a function from a sibling module and declares it as part of the public API. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious code are present. It functions solely to set up package namespace for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a standard purpose of package initialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
