  "conclusion": "The pattern of executing 'main()' during package installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, depending on the content of 'main.py'. This behavior poses a significant security risk, and the package should be treated with caution unless 'main.py' is verified as safe. The scores should reflect a high malware and risk level, emphasizing the need for further inspection of 'main.py'."
