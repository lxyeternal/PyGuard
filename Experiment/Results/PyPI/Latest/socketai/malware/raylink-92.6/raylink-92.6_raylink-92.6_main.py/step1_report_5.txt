  "purpose": "The code collects system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and sends this data to multiple external URLs as URL parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), MAC addresses via subprocess), and encodes MAC addresses in base64.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external URLs with sensitive data included in URL parameters via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Data from platform, getpass, os, and get_mac_addresses() flows into URL parameters, which are then sent over network via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded list of suspicious URLs (domains not associated with legitimate services), encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission, and collection of MAC addresses which may be used for tracking or fingerprinting. The URLs are obscure and possibly malicious. The code does not verify the legitimacy of the endpoints.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system-specific data, including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes the MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs with these parameters and sends GET requests to three obscure external domains. There are no obvious signs of data exfiltration beyond legitimate data collection, but the use of suspicious domains and transmission of MAC addresses without user consent raises privacy and security concerns. No code injection or malware signatures are present, but the activity resembles potentially tracking or reconnaissance behavior. The URLs are unusual and not associated with legitimate services, indicating malicious or at least suspicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect system information and transmit it to external domains, which is typical of tracking, reconnaissance, or malicious data exfiltration. The use of suspicious domains and encoding MAC addresses suggests potential privacy violations or malicious intent. No clear malware or backdoors are detected, but the behavior is suspicious and warrants caution.",
