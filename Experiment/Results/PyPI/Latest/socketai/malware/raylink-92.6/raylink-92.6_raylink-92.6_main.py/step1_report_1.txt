  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses) and send it to multiple external URLs as encoded data.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (via get_mac_addresses), and random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external URLs constructed with encoded system data and random number parameters using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, username, current path, MAC addresses (base64-encoded), and random number flows into URL parameters, which are then sent via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs pointing to suspicious domains; encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission; no user consent or control; exception handling suppresses errors silently; no obvious data validation or encryption beyond base64 encoding.",
  "analysis": "The script collects sensitive system information: hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory, and a random number. It encodes MAC addresses in base64 and sends this data along with other system info to multiple external URLs via HTTP GET requests. The URLs are suspicious and potentially malicious. The code does not perform any user interaction or clear purpose beyond data collection. Exception handling is broad, and errors are suppressed, which could mask malicious activity. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The behavior suggests data exfiltration without user consent, possibly malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform covert data collection and exfiltration of system information to potentially malicious domains, indicating a high security concern. While not explicitly malicious code like reverse shells or data theft from clipboard, its purpose aligns with malicious behavior due to unauthorized data exfiltration. It should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
