  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data to multiple remote URLs as encoded parameters.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) (HTTP requests to external URLs)",
  "flows": "Source functions (hostname, username, current_path, MAC addresses) -> encode parameters -> send via HTTP GET to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding of MAC addresses, construction of URLs with dynamic parameters, multiple external network requests to suspicious domains, no validation of responses, no obfuscation or encryption beyond base64",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive environment data, including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes MAC addresses in base64 and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to a set of external domains, which appear suspicious and potentially malicious. The use of random numbers in URLs could be to avoid caching or for tracking. There is no validation or handling of server responses, indicating a possible data exfiltration attempt. The code runs unconditionally under __main__, executing network requests without user consent or safeguards. No malicious payload like code execution or file manipulation is present, but the data collection and transmission behavior is concerning from a privacy and security perspective.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a data exfiltration tool collecting system information and transmitting it to external domains. While it does not contain overt malicious payloads such as backdoors or system damage, its behavior strongly suggests malicious intent related to privacy invasion and covert data transmission. It warrants caution due to suspicious URLs, data collection of sensitive system info, and lack of user awareness.",
