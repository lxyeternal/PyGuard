  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to specific external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which reads network interface data, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, and the constructed URLs with parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests to external domains with embedded system information as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses are gathered and encoded, then appended as URL parameters to external requests, which are sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domains (oast-cn, oast-row, oast.fun) known for testing or malicious activity, sending base64-encoded MAC addresses, and collecting system info without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses across different OS. It encodes MAC addresses in base64 and transmits this data via HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains that appear suspicious. The URLs do not seem related to legitimate service endpoints and may be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or malicious data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present, but the pattern of data collection and transmission to obscure domains indicates potentially malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior. The code does not appear obfuscated but does perform activity that could be used for tracking or unauthorized monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to gather and transmit system information to external, suspicious domains, which indicates potential privacy violations or malicious intent. While no direct malware actions like data theft or system damage are evident, the activity pattern raises security concerns related to covert data collection and communication with untrusted domains.",
