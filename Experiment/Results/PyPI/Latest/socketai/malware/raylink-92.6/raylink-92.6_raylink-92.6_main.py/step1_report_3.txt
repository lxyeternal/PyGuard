  "purpose": "The script collects system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and sends it to external URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Reading system info: platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses().",
  "sinks": "URIs constructed with system info parameters, opened via urllib.request.urlopen, which transmits data over the network.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded and included as URL parameters, then sent to external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external domains (including 'oast' domains often used in security testing). The URLs and the base64 encoding of MAC addresses suggest possible tracking or data collection. No explicit user consent prompts or obfuscation, but the data exfiltration is covert.",
  "analysis": "The code collects identifiable system data (hostname, username, MAC addresses) and encodes MAC addresses in base64, then sends this data to multiple external URLs. The URLs look suspicious, with some domains containing 'oast' (commonly used in security testing environments). The data transmission is done via GET requests with query parameters, which could be used for tracking or malicious exfiltration. No malicious payload execution, backdoors, or direct malware functions are evident. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications or destructive actions. Its primary behavior appears to be covert data collection and transmission, which could be malicious if used without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily collecting and transmitting system information to external servers. While it does not contain overt malware functions, the nature of data exfiltration to suspicious URLs suggests potentially malicious or tracking behavior. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to covert data transmission. No obfuscation is present, and the code is straightforward.",
