  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant supply chain security risk, especially if 'main()' is malicious. While the setup script itself is straightforward, this pattern is inherently dangerous. Without inspecting 'main.py', the risk remains speculative but notable. The malware score should be increased to reflect the potential for malicious payloads, and the overall security risk should be elevated accordingly. The pattern warrants caution and further review of 'main.py' before trusting or deploying this package."
