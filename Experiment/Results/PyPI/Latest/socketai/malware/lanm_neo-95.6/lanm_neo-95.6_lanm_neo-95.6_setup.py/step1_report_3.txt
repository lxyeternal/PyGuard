  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package with a custom installation step that executes a function from 'main' after installation.",
  "sources": "import statements, 'from main import main', execution within 'run' method",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' in the custom install class",
  "flows": "Installation process triggers 'CrazyInstallStrat.run()', which executes 'main()' from 'main' module",
  "anomalies": "Executing 'main()' during installation is unusual; no visible parameters or validation of 'main', potential for malicious code execution if 'main' is malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package, with a custom installation class that calls 'main()' from 'main' module after the package installs. The 'run' method overrides the standard install process, introducing a potential risk if 'main()' is malicious or contains malicious code. The script requires 'requests' and 'psutil', which are common dependencies. There are no indications of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior beyond the execution of an imported function during install. However, executing arbitrary code during package installation is considered suspicious and could be exploited if 'main' is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's custom install step executes 'main()' from an external module during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' contains harmful code. This behavior is unusual for a standard setup script and warrants caution. No other malicious indicators are present, but the design introduces potential supply chain risks.",
