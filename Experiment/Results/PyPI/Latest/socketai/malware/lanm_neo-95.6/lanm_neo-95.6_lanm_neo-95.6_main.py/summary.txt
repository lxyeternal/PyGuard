  "conclusion": "The script performs covert collection and transmission of system identifiers to suspicious domains, indicating high potential for malicious use such as tracking or data exfiltration. While it lacks active malware payloads, its behavior is strongly suspicious and warrants caution. The malware score is set to 0.75 due to the covert exfiltration, and the security risk is similarly high. The code is not obfuscated, and the overall threat level is significant but not active malware."
