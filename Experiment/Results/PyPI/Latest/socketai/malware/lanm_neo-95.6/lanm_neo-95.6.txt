      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant supply chain security risk, especially if 'main()' is malicious. While the setup script itself is straightforward, this pattern is inherently dangerous. Without inspecting 'main.py', the risk remains speculative but notable. The malware score should be increased to reflect the potential for malicious payloads, and the overall security risk should be elevated accordingly. The pattern warrants caution and further review of 'main.py' before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The script performs covert collection and transmission of system identifiers to suspicious domains, indicating high potential for malicious use such as tracking or data exfiltration. While it lacks active malware payloads, its behavior is strongly suspicious and warrants caution. The malware score is set to 0.75 due to the covert exfiltration, and the security risk is similarly high. The code is not obfuscated, and the overall threat level is significant but not active malware."
