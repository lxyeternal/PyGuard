      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant security risk. While the actual content of 'main()' is unknown, this pattern is commonly used in malicious packages to run payloads at install time. Therefore, the overall malware score should be high (around 0.75), and the security risk similarly elevated. Obfuscation is not present. This pattern warrants caution, further inspection of 'main()', and possibly flagging the package as potentially malicious until verified."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a reconnaissance and data exfiltration script that collects system info and transmits it to suspicious domains. While it does not contain payloads or system modifications, its behavior is characteristic of malicious exfiltration tools. The scores should reflect high suspicion of malicious intent and security risk, with minimal obfuscation."
