  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is suspicious and potentially malicious, representing a significant security risk. While the actual content of 'main()' is unknown, this pattern is commonly used in malicious packages to run payloads at install time. Therefore, the overall malware score should be high (around 0.75), and the security risk similarly elevated. Obfuscation is not present. This pattern warrants caution, further inspection of 'main()', and possibly flagging the package as potentially malicious until verified."
