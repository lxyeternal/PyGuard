{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, then send this data to multiple external URLs via HTTP GET requests with encoded parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading platform info (platform.system(), platform.node()), user info (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), MAC addresses (get_mac_addresses function).",
  "sinks": "Sending data via urllib.request.urlopen to external URLs with query parameters, potentially leaking sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Source data (system info, MAC addresses, directory) is encoded and included as URL parameters in requests sent to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs, including domains with suspicious TLDs (.cn, .fun), and the encoding of MAC addresses in base64 suggests an attempt to obfuscate data exfiltration. The code gathers system info and transmits it without user consent or obvious purpose, indicating possible malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters, sending HTTP GET requests to potentially malicious domains. The URLs appear suspicious, belonging to domains often associated with malicious activity or obfuscation. The code does not perform any local destructive action but exfiltrates sensitive system info without user consent. The use of random number in URL query suggests an attempt to avoid caching or detection. Overall, the behavior resembles data exfiltration typical of malware or spyware, with obfuscated data encoding and suspicious endpoints.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs information collection and exfiltration to external domains using obfuscated data encoding and suspicious URLs, indicating malicious intent. It appears designed to stealthily gather and transmit system info, possibly as part of a malware or spyware activity.",
