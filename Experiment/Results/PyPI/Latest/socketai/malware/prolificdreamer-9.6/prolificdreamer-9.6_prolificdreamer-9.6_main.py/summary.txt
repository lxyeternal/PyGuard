  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a reconnaissance and data exfiltration script that collects system info and transmits it to suspicious domains. While it does not contain payloads or system modifications, its behavior is characteristic of malicious exfiltration tools. The scores should reflect high suspicion of malicious intent and security risk, with minimal obfuscation."
