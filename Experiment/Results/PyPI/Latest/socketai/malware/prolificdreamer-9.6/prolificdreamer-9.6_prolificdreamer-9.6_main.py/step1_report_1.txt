{
  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple external URLs via GET requests.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reads system network info), base64 encoding of MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with URL-encoded parameters, transmitting collected data over the network.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path, MAC addresses) → encoded and embedded in URL parameters → transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious external URLs with 'oast' domains; encoding MAC addresses in base64 before transmission; no validation or filtering of data; silent exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The script collects host and user information, MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to three external URLs. The URLs appear to be suspicious or used for testing (oast domains). The data flow involves gathering system info (source), encoding it, and transmitting via GET requests (sink). The use of hardcoded external URLs and silent exception handling suggest obfuscation or data exfiltration attempts. No user input is involved, but the script actively transmits system data without user consent. The code does not perform any malicious system modifications but may serve for reconnaissance or data collection, which is potentially malicious behavior depending on intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a system information gatherer and exfiltrator, transmitting host data to external servers without user awareness. The presence of suspicious URLs and encoding of MAC addresses indicate possible malicious intent or at least malicious patterning, such as tracking or reconnaissance. Overall, it is suspicious and could be malicious depending on context.",
