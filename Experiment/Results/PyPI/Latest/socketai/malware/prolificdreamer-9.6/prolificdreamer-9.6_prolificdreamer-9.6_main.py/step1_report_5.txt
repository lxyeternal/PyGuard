  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and generate a random number, then send this data encoded in base64 to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "Platform module (platform.system, platform.node), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint, get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to send data to external URLs with query parameters, including encoded MAC addresses and system info.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources (MAC addresses, hostname, username, directory, random number) is encoded and sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs, potentially enabling data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes MAC addresses and system info in base64 and transmits it to suspicious domains without user consent. The URLs seem malicious or suspicious. The code does not handle responses meaningfully, only attempts to send data silently. No validation or encryption is used for the transmitted data.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system-specific data, including MAC addresses obtained via system commands, hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64 and appends this data, along with other system info, to URLs that appear suspicious and are not associated with legitimate services. The data is transmitted via HTTP GET requests to these URLs, which could facilitate covert data exfiltration. The script operates silently without user consent or feedback, suggesting malicious intent. No obfuscation or complex code techniques are used; the code structure is straightforward but intentionally designed to send potentially sensitive system info to external servers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect system identifiers and send them to external, suspicious domains without user consent. The behavior indicates possible data exfiltration for malicious purposes. The URLs are suspicious and indicate malicious intent. The code poses a security risk and should be flagged for potential malicious activity.",
