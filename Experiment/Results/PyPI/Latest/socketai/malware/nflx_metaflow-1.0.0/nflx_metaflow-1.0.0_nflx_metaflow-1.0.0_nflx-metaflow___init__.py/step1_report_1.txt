  "purpose": "The code defines a simple test function that returns a string, likely for testing or placeholder purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the function is isolated and returns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, containing only a single function that returns a fixed string. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns. It appears to be harmless and likely serves as a placeholder or a test function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines a placeholder function that returns a static string.",
