  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Actual Presence of Issues**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is minimal: a single function `test()` returning the string `\"Fake Package\"`. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no network or file operations, and no suspicious patterns. The code is benign and appears to be a placeholder or dummy function.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is harmless, with no malicious indicators, obfuscation, or anomalies. No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- `obfuscated`: all reports assign 0 or 0.0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n- `malware`: all reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- `securityRisk`: all reports assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**  \nSince the code is just a placeholder with no malicious intent, the scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified. The `obfuscated` score is also correctly 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign. There are no claims about vulnerabilities that are based on false premises.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \nScores are consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence levels (mostly 1, some 0.9) are appropriate given the clear, minimal code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious behavior detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature, I agree with the current assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a trivial placeholder function with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0",
