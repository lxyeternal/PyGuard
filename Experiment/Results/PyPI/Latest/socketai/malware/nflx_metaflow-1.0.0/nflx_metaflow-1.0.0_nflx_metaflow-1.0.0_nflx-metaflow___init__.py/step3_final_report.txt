  "purpose": "A simple placeholder function returning a static string, serving as dummy or test code.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, environment variables, or data sources; static code only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process external data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the function simply returns a fixed string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial function with no external dependencies, dynamic execution, or malicious indicators. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static return value confirm its harmless intent. Scores assigned by reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate; no modifications are necessary.",
