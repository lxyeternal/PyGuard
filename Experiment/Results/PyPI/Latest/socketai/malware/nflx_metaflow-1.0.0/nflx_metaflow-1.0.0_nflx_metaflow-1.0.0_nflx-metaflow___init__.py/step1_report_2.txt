  "purpose": "A simple function returning a string, possibly a placeholder or a fake package indicator.",
  "sources": "The function 'test' which returns a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No data flow to external systems or untrusted outputs detected.",
  "flows": "No external data flow from input to output or system actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function that returns a static string 'Fake  Package'. There are no input sources, no data leaks, no external calls, or dynamic code execution. The presence of the string 'Fake Package' might suggest mislabeling, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or unusual programming patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, minimal, and appears to be a placeholder or a dummy package indicator. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
