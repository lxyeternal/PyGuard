  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to an external IP address, potentially for tracking or malicious surveillance.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api64.ipify.org' for IP address; socket.gethostname() for hostname; os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "Requests POST to 'http://35.170.187.220:8080' sending collected data.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system inputs (IP, hostname, cwd) and sent directly via HTTP POST request to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "Code automatically sends system info to a suspicious external IP without user consent. No clear legitimate purpose stated. No validation or user interaction; unsolicited data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing modules and collecting system information (public IP, hostname, current directory). It then immediately sends this data to a specific external IP address via an HTTP POST request. The package setup information appears standard and does not contain malicious code. However, the automatic exfiltration of system info to an external IP with no user permission is suspicious and indicative of potential malicious intent or backdoor behavior. The code does not perform any validation, logging, or user notification, further increasing the concern. No other suspicious behaviors such as code obfuscation, credential theft, or malware-like actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly transmits system information to a remote server without user consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It resembles malicious tracking or data exfiltration behavior rather than legitimate package setup.",
