{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to package a Python module named 'nflx-metaflow' with metadata, but it also collects and exfiltrates system information to an external server.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api64.ipify.org' to get IP address, socket.gethostname() for hostname, os.getcwd() for current working directory.",
  "sinks": "requests.post to 'http://35.170.187.220:8080' to send collected data.",
  "flows": "Input data from external IP service, local hostname, and current directory are collected and then sent to an external server via HTTP POST.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration upon module import; no user consent or control; use of external IP API and a hardcoded external IP address for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information including public IP, hostname, and current working directory at import time. It then immediately exfiltrates this data to an external server without any user interaction, validation, or obvious purpose. The code then proceeds to define package metadata using setup(). There are no input validation, authentication, or encryption measures for the data transfer. The use of requests for data exfiltration during module import suggests malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior, especially in a package meant for dependency use. The code does not appear to be obfuscated but does contain suspicious behavior due to unsolicited data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code exfiltrates sensitive system information without user consent and is embedded within a package setup script, which could be used maliciously for reconnaissance or data theft. The behavior indicates malicious intent with high suspicion, primarily due to covert data exfiltration on import.",
