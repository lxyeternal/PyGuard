{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information (IP address, hostname, current working directory) and sends it to an external server, alongside package setup metadata.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api64.ipify.org' to obtain IP address, socket.gethostname() for hostname, os.getcwd() for current directory.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to external IP, which could be used for user tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data from network (IP), system info (hostname, cwd) collected and then transmitted via HTTP POST to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration without user consent; use of external IP address for tracking; no documentation or clear purpose for data collection; the server address appears suspicious and is not related to the package's described purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules but uses 'requests' to retrieve the public IP address and then posts collected system info to an external IP address. This behavior is outside typical package setup routines and suggests possible malicious intent for user surveillance or data theft. No validation or user notification is present. The setup function itself is benign but is preceded by potentially malicious data exfiltration activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior—collecting and transmitting system information without user consent to an external server. This is indicative of malicious intent or privacy invasion. The package's primary function appears unrelated to this activity, suggesting potential sabotage or covert tracking.",
