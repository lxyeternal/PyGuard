{
  "purpose": "The code gathers system information and sends it to an external server, while defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api64.ipify.org' for public IP, socket.gethostname() for hostname, os.getcwd() for current directory, and a POST request to 'http://35.170.187.220:8080' with the collected data.",
  "sinks": "The external POST request to the specified IP address, which transmits sensitive system data.",
  "flows": "System information (IP, hostname, cwd) is collected from sources and transmitted via the requests.post sink to the external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic transmission of system data to an external IP address without user consent. The code does not perform any validation or user interaction before data transmission. The URL used for data exfiltration appears suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules, then collects system information such as public IP, hostname, and current working directory. It then immediately sends this data to a remote server at 'http://35.170.187.220:8080'. This behavior is typical of data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities, especially considering the lack of user consent prompts or disclosures. The package metadata section simply defines package information for distribution, which appears benign and unrelated to the malicious data collection. The use of requests to send system data to an external IP is suspicious and potentially malicious, indicating possible surveillance or data theft. The overall structure suggests the code's primary intent is to covertly gather and transmit system info.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior by silently collecting and exfiltrating system information to an external server without user consent. The behavior indicates a potential security threat related to data leakage or surveillance. The package's declared purpose as a proof-of-concept for dependency confusion does not align with the malicious data collection, raising further suspicion.",
