{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process that includes a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the platform module (platform.node(), platform.system()) and from the external IP API (https://api.ipify.org).",
  "sinks": "The data collected is sent via an HTTP GET request to a specific webhook URL, which could be used to exfiltrate environment information.",
  "flows": "The code collects system information (hostname, OS, external IP) and then constructs a URL that sends this data to the webhook site using a GET request.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function executes after installation, exfiltrating system information without user consent. The URL is hardcoded and contains a webhook endpoint, indicating potential malicious intent. The code does not perform any validation or user notification.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a Python package with a custom install command that, upon installation, runs the send() function. This function retrieves system hostname and OS type via platform module and fetches external IP using requests. It then constructs a URL with this data and makes a GET request to a webhook URL, potentially exfiltrating sensitive system info. No user prompt or consent is obtained, and the behavior occurs automatically after installation, indicating malicious intent or at least privacy-invasive behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads like reverse shells or data theft beyond info exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information immediately after installation without user consent, using a webhook URL. This constitutes a privacy breach and potential security threat, classifying it as malicious or highly suspicious.",
