{
  "purpose": "To define a Python package setup process with a custom post-installation hook that performs an HTTP request.",
  "sources": "The requests.get() function calls in the send() function, especially the URL constructed with platform information and external IP.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() calls, especially the GET request to the webhook URL which transmits system data.",
  "flows": "After installation, the send() function executes, sending system hostname, OS, and external IP address to an external URL via GET request.",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs a URL with system data and makes a GET request without user consent, potentially leaking system information. The webhook URL and IP address request suggest possible data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package with a custom install command. The custom command runs the send() function, which gathers system information (hostname, OS, public IP) and sends it to an external webhook URL. This behavior occurs automatically after installation, which is suspicious because it transmits potentially identifiable system data without user awareness. The use of requests to send data to an external server constitutes a privacy violation and could be used for malicious surveillance or tracking. No other malicious code, such as data theft, backdoors, or destructive actions, is present. The code does not perform any destructive actions but does compromise user privacy by exfiltrating system data.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a hidden data exfiltration by sending system details to an external URL during installation, which is malicious behavior from a privacy and security standpoint. The package’s primary purpose appears to be benign, but the hidden network activity indicates malicious intent or at least serious privacy violations.",
