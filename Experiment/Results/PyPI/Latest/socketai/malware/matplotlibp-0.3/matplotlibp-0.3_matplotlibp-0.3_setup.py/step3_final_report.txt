{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup that, during installation, silently exfiltrates system hostname, OS, and external IP address to a specified webhook URL.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get() call sending data to external webhook URL",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info functions flows directly into URL construction and is sent via requests.get() to external server",
  "anomalies": "Automatic, silent data exfiltration during package installation without user notification or consent; straightforward code with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs a covert exfiltration of environment data (hostname, OS, external IP) during installation, which is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent. The data is sent via a GET request to an external webhook URL, violating user privacy. The code is simple, unobfuscated, and functions as intended, with no technical errors. The activity aligns with malicious behavior such as tracking or surveillance. The malware score is justified at 0.9 due to the high likelihood of malicious activity, and the security risk score is similarly high at 0.9, reflecting privacy invasion and potential misuse.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious code that exfiltrates system information during installation, representing a serious security and privacy threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the observed behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
