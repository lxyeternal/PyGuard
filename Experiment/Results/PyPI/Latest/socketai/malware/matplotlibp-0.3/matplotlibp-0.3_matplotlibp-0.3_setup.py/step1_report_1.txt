  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom post-installation step.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname, OS platform info, and external IP via requests to 'https://api.ipify.org'.",
  "sinks": "Sends data via a GET request to a webhook URL with collected data embedded in URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, system name, and IP address, then constructs a URL and performs a GET request to it, transmitting system information.",
  "anomalies": "Performs data exfiltration to an external webhook upon package installation, which is unusual for a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a function 'send' that collects system data and exfiltrates it via a GET request to a webhook URL. The 'send' function is invoked during a custom installation command, executed after standard install procedures. This behavior indicates data leakage or potential malicious activity, as it sends environment-specific information without user consent. The package's metadata suggests it's a Linux development package, but the embedded network activity is suspicious and not standard for such packages. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly exfiltrates system information during installation by sending it to an external webhook, which is suspicious behavior. This could be used for tracking or malicious surveillance purposes. Overall, the script demonstrates malicious intent with high confidence.",
