{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs a custom post-install hook.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and makes HTTP requests to an external IP service (https://api.ipify.org) and a webhook URL.",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed with platform data and the IP address is used in an HTTP GET request sent to an external webhook endpoint.",
  "flows": "The system information and external IP are combined into a URL string, which is then used as the destination in requests.get(), sending potentially sensitive data to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install function send() automatically transmits system node name, system type, and external IP address to a remote webhook URL without any user consent or explicit notification, which is unusual behavior for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom install command that, upon execution, calls a function 'send'. This function prints a message and constructs a URL with system and IP info, then makes a GET request to that URL. The URL is a webhook with embedded data, likely intended for logging or tracking. The external data transmission occurs silently during package installation, which could be malicious or a privacy violation. There are no indications of obfuscation or other malicious code, but the behavior of sending system info to an external webhook without user knowledge is suspicious and could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious behavior: it secretly transmits system information to an external webhook during installation. This action appears to be intended for tracking or data collection without user consent, constituting potentially malicious behavior.",
