  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard, static setup script using setuptools.\n- No untrusted inputs, dynamic code, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code is benign, with common dependencies and straightforward metadata.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs.\n   - The description mentioning \"trolling library\" is benign and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n2. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks:**\n   - The setup script is static and only defines package metadata.\n   - No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved.\n   - No network operations or code execution occurs within this script.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - All reports give a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the static and standard nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores?**\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent across all reports.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n- The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The malware score remains at 0.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0.\n- The overall risk score remains at 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
