  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'utilitypyfunc' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own package configuration parameters, package discovery via find_packages(), and dependencies via install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration reads static metadata, finds packages, and specifies dependencies; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated sections, or hidden behavior. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools to package a Python library. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration options. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. All data used is static or from standard package setup functions. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The comments and naming are benign, and no external inputs are processed dynamically.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and is designed solely to configure package distribution.",
