  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools, with no dynamic code, user input, or external data sources. Dependencies are benign, and the description is humorous but harmless. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores from the reports align with this assessment, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0. The confidence levels are high, reflecting static analysis. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
