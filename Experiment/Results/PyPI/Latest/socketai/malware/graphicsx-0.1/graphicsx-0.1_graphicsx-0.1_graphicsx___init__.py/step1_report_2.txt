  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to involve some form of data processing or interaction with external systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, and potentially external files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to network sockets, written to files, or used in subprocess calls. Sensitive data may be outputted or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment or function parameters flows into network transmission functions, subprocess calls, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. Usage of dynamic execution or obfuscated code is absent. No suspicious network connections are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data handling and system interactions. It does not include code that indicates malicious intent such as data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or system damage. The functions and flow are typical for legitimate applications. No unusual or suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The structure suggests a typical utility or processing script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks in this code. It appears to be benign and follows normal coding practices.",
