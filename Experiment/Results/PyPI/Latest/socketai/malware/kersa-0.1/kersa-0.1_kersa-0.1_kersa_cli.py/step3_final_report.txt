{
  "purpose": "A simple function that outputs a static message, serving as a benign CLI prompt or message display.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, inputs, or dependencies; static code with no data flow.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication; only a print statement.",
  "flows": "None; the code executes a single print statement without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward static message.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single function 'cli()' that prints a fixed message. No input sources, external dependencies, or data flows are present. The code is simple, clear, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code poses no security threat, and the scores are consistent with its characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
