  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a single `print` statement outputting a static message.\n   - No input sources, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious code, or harmful actions.\n   - The code does not perform network activity, handle secrets, or manipulate system resources.\n   - The message appears to be informational or a placeholder, possibly indicating a non-legitimate package.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign `0`. Given the simplicity and benign nature, this is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign `0`. No obfuscation is present.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign `0`. The code is harmless.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The message's tone (\"not the package you're looking for!\") might be dismissive or misleading, but it does not constitute a security risk or malicious intent.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their benign assessment.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is trivial, the likelihood of hidden malicious intent is extremely low.\n   - The only potential concern could be if this code is part of a larger, obfuscated package, but based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall conclusion**:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings. No changes are necessary.",
