  "purpose": "The code outputs a message indicating that the current package is not the intended one.",
  "sources": "The source is the print statement which outputs a fixed string.",
  "sinks": "The print statement is not a sink for untrusted data; it only outputs static text.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only performs a static print.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single print statement with a static message. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior. It does not read external data, perform any network activity, or manipulate system resources. Given its simplicity, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The message suggests a placeholder or a benign indicator that this code is not part of a legitimate package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performs a simple print operation, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
