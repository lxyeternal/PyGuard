  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of a single `print` statement outputting a static message.\n   - There are no data sources, no data flows, no input handling, no network activity, and no system manipulation.\n   - The code is straightforward, minimal, and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Risks**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious, such as executing system commands, reading untrusted input, or exfiltrating data.\n   - The message appears to be a placeholder or informational, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n3. **Obfuscation**:\n   - All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation techniques.\n\n4. **Security Risk & Overall Assessment**:\n   - The security risk score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n5. **Scores Justification & Recommendations**:\n   - The scores assigned seem reasonable and consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is just a print statement with no suspicious behavior, even a higher malware or obfuscated score would be unjustified.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign and non-malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threats. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is entirely benign with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
