{
  "purpose": "Display a static message indicating the package is not the intended one.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data beyond the static print statement.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the print statement outputs a fixed string without external input or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward print statement with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single print statement outputting a static message. All reports correctly identify that there are no data sources, no data flows, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. There are no signs of malicious intent, hidden behaviors, or security risks. The message appears to be a placeholder or informational statement, with no indicators of sabotage or malicious activity. Given the simplicity and transparency of the code, the assessment of zero malware, obfuscation, and security risk is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary, and the overall security assessment remains at the lowest risk level.",
