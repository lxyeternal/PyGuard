  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Behavior:**\n   - All reports consistently state that the code is a simple print statement with no input, no data flow, no obfuscation, and no malicious functions.\n   - The code outputs a static message indicating that it is not the intended package, which appears benign and likely serves as a placeholder or informational message.\n\n2. **Code Review:**\n   - The original code:\n     ```python\n     print(\"This is not the package you're looking for!\")\n     ```\n   - There are no signs of hidden behaviors, obfuscated code, or malicious activity.\n   - No external data sources, no network activity, no secrets, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign a 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign a 0, consistent with the straightforward, unobfuscated print statement.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign a 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; no assumptions about malicious intent are justified.\n   - The message itself could be considered dismissive or misleading, but that does not constitute a security risk or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores or the assessment.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a harmless placeholder message with no security concerns.",
