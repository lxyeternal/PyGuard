  "purpose": "Modify installation process to run external commands, possibly for setup or malicious activity",
  "sources": "Lambda functions constructing URLs and commands, subprocess.run calls with shell=True",
  "sinks": "subprocess.run executing constructed commands with shell=True, possibly executing malicious code or downloading payloads",
  "flows": "Constructs URL and command strings -> subprocess.run with shell=True -> execution of external commands that may download or run malicious code",
  "anomalies": "Use of lambda functions to assemble strings representing URLs and commands, dynamic command execution with shell=True, silent suppression of errors, and obfuscated string assembly via chr codes",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, during installation, attempts to run external commands constructed dynamically. The URL string is assembled from chr codes, pointing to a raw GitHub URL, which suggests potential downloading of remote content. The subprocess.run commands execute commands via shell=True, which is risky, as it can execute arbitrary code if the input is maliciously crafted. The second subprocess call pipes the output of a URL fetch into another command, which can be malicious if the URL content is compromised or if the command string is malicious. Error handling is minimal, only catching FileNotFoundError and passing otherwise. This behavior indicates a likely attempt to download and execute external code during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly suspicious, as it dynamically constructs a URL and executes shell commands to download and possibly execute remote content during package installation. This pattern is commonly associated with supply chain attacks or malicious backdoors. The obfuscation via chr codes and silent error handling further suggest malicious intent. It is recommended not to use this package.",
