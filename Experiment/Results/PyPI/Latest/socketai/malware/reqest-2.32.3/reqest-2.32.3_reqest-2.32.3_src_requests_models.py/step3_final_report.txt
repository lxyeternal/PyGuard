{
  "purpose": "The code includes standard HTTP request and response classes for the Requests library, but contains embedded malicious code that downloads and executes an external payload, indicating sabotage or malware.",
  "sources": "The malicious code executes immediately upon module load, decoding a base64 URL, downloading an executable to TEMP, and running it via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The code downloads a remote executable and runs it without validation, leading to potential remote code execution and system compromise.",
  "flows": "Base64-encoded URL decoded -> downloaded via urllib.request.urlretrieve -> saved as 'asd2.exe' in TEMP -> executed with subprocess.Popen with detached flags.",
  "anomalies": "Malicious code is outside the normal scope of the library, runs at import time, and uses obfuscation (base64) to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical malware pattern: obfuscated remote payload download and execution. It is embedded outside legitimate classes, indicating sabotage. The rest of the code appears standard for an HTTP library. The malicious snippet is active, unvalidated, and highly dangerous. The scores assigned (malware: 1, obfuscated: ~0.8-0.9, risk: 1) are consistent with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The embedded code constitutes a supply chain attack or sabotage, making the entire package highly malicious and unsafe. The rest of the code is legitimate, but the malicious snippet dominates the security assessment.",
