{
  "purpose": "This code is part of the Requests library, providing classes and methods to construct, prepare, and handle HTTP requests and responses in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (os.getenv), potentially input data in request bodies (data, json, files), URL strings, and cookie data.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess with a URL retrieved from a base64-encoded string; potential network request via urllib.request.urlretrieve; assignment to self.body and headers; use of external libraries for JSON and encoding; manipulation of URL components.",
  "flows": "The malicious code retrieves a URL from a base64-decoded string, saves it as an executable in the TEMP directory, and then executes it via subprocess.Popen. This occurs immediately upon module load. The rest of the code is standard request/response handling, with no other clear data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code appears at the very beginning: a hardcoded base64 string decoded to a URL, which is then downloaded and executed automatically. This code runs without any function call or condition, executing as soon as the module is imported. It does not relate to the purpose of the rest of the code. No other anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed in the remaining classes.",
  "analysis": "The code initially executes a base64-decoded URL download, saving the file as 'asd2.exe' in the TEMP directory, and immediately runs it in a detached process. This is outside the normal behavior of the Requests library and appears malicious, likely a supply chain attack or embedded malware. The rest of the code defines standard classes for HTTP request/response handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The early execution of subprocess.Popen with decoded URL indicates a deliberate attempt to run external, potentially harmful code upon module import, constituting malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The module contains embedded malicious code that automatically downloads and executes a remote executable via base64-decoded URL, representing a supply chain compromise or intentional malware inclusion. The rest of the code is standard for the Requests library and does not show signs of malicious behavior. Overall, this package is highly dangerous due to the embedded malware.",
