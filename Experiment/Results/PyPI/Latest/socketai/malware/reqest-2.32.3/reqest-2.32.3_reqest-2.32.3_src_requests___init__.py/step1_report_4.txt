  "purpose": "The code is a Python library, 'Requests,' designed to facilitate HTTP requests, including GET and POST methods, with compatibility checks and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads from imported modules, version strings, and dependency version variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; mainly performs dependency compatibility checks, warnings, and imports.",
  "flows": "Source data (versions, dependency info) flows through compatibility checks and warnings, with no untrusted data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive version checks and conditionally injects pyopenssl for SSL fallback; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages dependencies, performs version compatibility assertions, and configures SSL fallback mechanisms. It imports multiple modules, handles potential ImportErrors gracefully, and silences warnings that are standard for this type of library. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code injections. All operations are related to dependency validation, environment setup, and logging configuration. The overall structure aligns with a legitimate, well-maintained HTTP request library, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, dependency management and setup script for the 'Requests' HTTP library. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It performs typical compatibility checks, warning configurations, and imports. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
