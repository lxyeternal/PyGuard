  "purpose": "Maintain backward compatibility by aliasing modules ('urllib3', 'idna', 'chardet') under 'requests.packages.*' via sys.modules manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports of 'urllib3', 'idna', and optional 'chardet'; dynamic assignment in sys.modules.",
  "sinks": "sys.modules entries for 'requests.packages.*' modules, affecting module resolution.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules entries under 'requests.packages.*', affecting subsequent imports.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual manipulation of sys.modules for compatibility; no malicious code or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs module aliasing for legacy support, using dynamic sys.modules reassignment. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. The purpose is solely to preserve import paths. The sys.modules manipulation is unconventional but known in compatibility contexts. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious behavior. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the unusual but benign sys.modules manipulation. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim with no malicious intent or malicious code. The sys.modules manipulation is for legacy support and does not pose a security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.1-0.2. Overall, the code is benign and safe to use.",
