{
  "purpose": "Maintain backwards compatibility by aliasing certain packages and preserving their module identities within the sys.modules namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'chardet' attribute from the .compat module and inspects sys.modules for existing modules.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns modules to sys.modules entries, which can influence subsequent imports but does not directly lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Modules from sys.modules are reassigned to new keys in sys.modules, maintaining original module identities but with different names.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic module importing and sys.modules manipulation, which can be considered unusual and potentially risky if misused. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific packages ('urllib3', 'idna') and assigns them to local variables. It then modifies sys.modules to create aliases under 'requests.packages.*' to preserve compatibility. The use of __import__ and dynamic sys.modules modification is unusual but appears solely aimed at compatibility, not malicious intent. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code lacks network activity, cryptography, or backdoors. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended solely for backwards compatibility, aliasing packages within sys.modules to ensure consistent package structure. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. It is a standard compatibility pattern with no indicators of harmful intent.",
