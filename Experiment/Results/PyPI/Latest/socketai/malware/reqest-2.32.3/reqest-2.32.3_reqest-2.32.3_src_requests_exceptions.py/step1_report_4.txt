{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes used by the requests library for handling various HTTP and network errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the import statements and class definitions, primarily defining exception classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects; no input or output operations are performed.",
  "flows": "The code defines class inheritance and exception initialization flows; no data flows from sources to sinks with security implications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior observed; the code is straightforward exception class definitions with standard inheritance and initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for request-related exceptions, including custom error classes and warnings. It imports exceptions from external libraries and defines subclasses with standard initializers. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network operations are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. The inheritance and method overrides follow typical patterns, and the code serves as a structured exception hierarchy.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of exception class definitions for the requests library, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
