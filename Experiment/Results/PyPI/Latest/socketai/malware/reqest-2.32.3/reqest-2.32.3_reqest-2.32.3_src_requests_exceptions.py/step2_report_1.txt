  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's security posture, consistency of scores, and any potential issues.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a standard exception class hierarchy for the Requests library.\n- It imports from standard libraries and defines classes with typical inheritance.\n- No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling with untrusted input are present.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with proper constructors and docstrings.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The use of __reduce__ in JSONDecodeError is standard for pickling support.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware score (0.0):** Correct; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score (0.0):** Correct; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score (0.0):** Correct; no security vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n\n- All reports assign high confidence (1.0) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report supports these scores.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The only minor point is that exception classes accept *args and **kwargs, which could, in theory, be manipulated if user-controlled data is passed during exception instantiation. However, this is standard practice and does not pose a security risk unless exceptions are constructed with untrusted data and then logged or mishandled elsewhere. Given that this is a library defining exception classes, this is acceptable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is benign, standard, and well-structured.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no vulnerabilities or security issues)\n\n**Final note:** The code serves as a foundational exception hierarchy for error handling, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The report's analysis and scores are accurate and reasonable. No changes are necessary.",
