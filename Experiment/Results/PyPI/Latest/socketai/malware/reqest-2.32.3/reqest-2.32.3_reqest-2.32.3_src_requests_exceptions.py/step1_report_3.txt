{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes for the Requests library, handling different error scenarios during HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "None; the code primarily defines classes and imports external exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no direct data sinks or operations that process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up exception classes and does not process input data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code consists of standard class definitions and imports without any suspicious logic or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exceptions from external modules and defines several custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in HTTP requests. All classes inherit from standard Python exception types, and there are no operations that process or handle untrusted data. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The structure is typical for exception handling in a Python library, and no suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for error handling without introducing vulnerabilities.",
