{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various errors in the Requests library, including connection issues, decoding errors, and HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and internal compatibility module for JSON decoding errors.",
  "sinks": "None of the defined classes directly handle untrusted data or perform data output operations; primarily exception handling and class definitions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this module only defines exception classes without data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code follows standard patterns for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard exceptions and defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for various network and decoding errors. It includes a nuanced implementation of JSONDecodeError to preserve compatibility and pickling behavior. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior. The class inheritance and method implementations follow typical patterns, with no suspicious logic or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of exception classes for the Requests library, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is structurally sound, and there are no anomalies or malicious signals.",
