  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains static variable assignments that describe package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. There are no dynamic behaviors, data input/output operations, or suspicious code features. The metadata is consistent with open-source project conventions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as straightforward package metadata documentation with no malicious behavior or security issues identified.",
