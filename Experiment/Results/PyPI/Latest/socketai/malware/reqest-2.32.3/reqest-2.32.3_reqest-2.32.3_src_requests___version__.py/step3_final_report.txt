  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for the 'requests' Python library, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and other metadata.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments defining package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks exists in this static metadata code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for package metadata, with no dynamic code, network calls, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted, and the code's simplicity confirms its benign intent. The high confidence scores (1) across reports are justified given the static and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static package metadata declaration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
