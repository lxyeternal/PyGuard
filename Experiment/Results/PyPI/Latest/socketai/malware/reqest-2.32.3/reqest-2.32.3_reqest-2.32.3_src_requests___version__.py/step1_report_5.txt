  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values assigned to variables such as __title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, etc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static metadata values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious indicators present.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely metadata definitions for the 'requests' package, including version, author info, license, and URL. It contains no input handling, external calls, or logic that could be exploited or used maliciously. The content appears standard for a Python package's metadata module. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be an unremarkable, safe component of the 'requests' library.",
