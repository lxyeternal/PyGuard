  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location using certifi's where() function.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the certifi package and calling it in the main block.",
  "sinks": "Printing the CA bundle path; no untrusted data processing or output streams involved.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where() -> print(where())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for obtaining CA bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a standard library function from the certifi package and outputs the CA bundle location when executed directly. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, no network activity, or suspicious behavior. The code's purpose is solely to output a static file path. The usage of certifi is standard and safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility to output the CA bundle path from certifi. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior, functioning as expected for its purpose.",
