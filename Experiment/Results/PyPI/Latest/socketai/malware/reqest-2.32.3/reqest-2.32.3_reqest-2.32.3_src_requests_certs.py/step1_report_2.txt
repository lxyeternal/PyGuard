{
  "purpose": "Provides the path to the default CA certificate bundle used by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'where' function from the certifi package; executes 'print(where())' if run as main.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the CA bundle path via standard output; no untrusted data handling or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> print(where()) when executed as main; no other data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function to retrieve the default CA bundle path and prints it if run directly. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious operations. The logic is standard and aligns with its purpose of exposing the CA bundle path. No malware indicators or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module that outputs the certifi CA bundle path with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation with no suspicious or malicious features.",
