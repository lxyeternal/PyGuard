{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for SSL/TLS certificate validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the certifi package through the import of 'where'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, but does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "The source (import 'where') supplies the CA bundle location, which is then outputted via print(), without involving untrusted data or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hidden or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, then prints the path to the CA bundle. This is a standard and safe operation, providing the location of a trusted certificate bundle for SSL verification. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code's purpose is to assist in packaging or debugging requests-related SSL configurations. There are no suspicious behaviors or anomalies identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to display the default CA bundle path from certifi. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
