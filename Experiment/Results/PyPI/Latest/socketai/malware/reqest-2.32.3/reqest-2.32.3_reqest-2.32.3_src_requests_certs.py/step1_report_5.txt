{
  "purpose": "The code provides the default CA bundle location used for SSL verification in requests.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and calls it to get the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The only sink is the 'print(where())' statement, which outputs the CA bundle path to the console.",
  "flows": "The source 'where' function outputs the CA bundle path, which is then printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code segments. It simply outputs a certificate bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a well-known, reputable package 'certifi' and prints its output. There are no hardcoded secrets, no external input handling beyond this import, and no suspicious behaviors. The purpose appears to be to display the default CA bundle path. No obfuscation or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path used by 'requests'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
