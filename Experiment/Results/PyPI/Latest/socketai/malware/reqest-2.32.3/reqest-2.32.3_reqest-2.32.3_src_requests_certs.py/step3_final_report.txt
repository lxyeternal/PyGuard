  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only prints a trusted path",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing 'where' to printing its value when executed as main",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints its value. It does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The purpose is solely to display the trusted CA bundle path. All security signals indicate benign behavior. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk features. The reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores reflect this. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
