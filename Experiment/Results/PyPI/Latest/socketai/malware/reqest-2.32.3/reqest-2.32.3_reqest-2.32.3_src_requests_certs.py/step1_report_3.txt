{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to output the default CA certificate bundle location used by the 'certifi' package.",
  "sources": "The 'where' function imported from the 'certifi' module.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The 'where' function retrieves the CA bundle path, which is then printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code simply exposes the path to CA certificates.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and prints its output if executed directly. There are no input sources such as user input or untrusted data. The only action is to display the default CA bundle path. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident, and the code appears to be a straightforward utility for configuration or informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that reveals the location of the CA bundle provided by 'certifi'. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is purely informational with no indication of malicious intent.",
