      "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of exec() to evaluate an external file, which could be exploited if the file is tampered with. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score should be low (~0.2), reflecting the exec() concern, but overall the code is safe for use if the version file integrity is maintained."
