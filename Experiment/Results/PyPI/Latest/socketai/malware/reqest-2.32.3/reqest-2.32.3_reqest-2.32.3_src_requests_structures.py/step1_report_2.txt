  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling HTTP headers and lookup data in a case-insensitive manner.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), data access methods (__getitem__, get), and update methods (update).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to constructors or update methods flows into internal storage; data retrieval via __getitem__, get, or iteration methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. Both are data structures for internal data handling. CaseInsensitiveDict manages keys case-insensitively, storing the original case for display and comparison purposes. It uses an OrderedDict internally to preserve key order. LookupDict is a simple dictionary extension with optional naming, primarily for lookup purposes. No external inputs, network connections, or dynamic code execution are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The code appears to be well-structured, standard, and intended for internal data handling within the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard, non-malicious data structures for internal use in the requests library. It contains no malicious intent or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious signals detected.",
