  "purpose": "Define data structures that provide case-insensitive dictionary-like objects for internal use within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), item setting (__setitem__), item getting (__getitem__), and other dictionary methods that access internal storage.",
  "sinks": "Methods that access or return data from internal structures, such as __getitem__, get, and __repr__.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., during initialization or update) flows into internal storage; data retrieved via __getitem__, get, or iteration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal storage with case-insensitive keys; no evidence of code injection, external data handling, or suspicious code patterns. The copy method returns self._store.values() which may not create an independent copy, but this is standard for internal copying.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. CaseInsensitiveDict manages keys case-insensitively by storing them in lowercase but preserving original case for iteration. It provides standard dictionary methods, with no apparent external data handling or malicious logic. LookupDict provides a simple dict-like object that stores data in __dict__, with minimal logic. Neither class performs network operations, external data transmission, or dynamic code execution. All methods are standard dictionary implementations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The copy method in CaseInsensitiveDict might not produce a deep copy but does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines internal data structures for the Requests library, implementing case-insensitive and lookup dictionaries without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is standard, safe, and does not introduce security risks or malware.",
