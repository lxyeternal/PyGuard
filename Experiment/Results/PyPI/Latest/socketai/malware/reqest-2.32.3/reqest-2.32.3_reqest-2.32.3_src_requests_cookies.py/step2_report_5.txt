  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, following the step-by-step instructions:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code appears to be standard cookie management utilities.\n- **Errors/flaws/mistakes:** No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- **Scores review:** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Risk justification:** The overall risk is minimal; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are identified.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malware detected.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions; the report correctly states the benign nature.\n- **Scores consistency:** Consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's nature. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code is standard for cookie handling.\n- **Errors/flaws/mistakes:** No; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores review:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2 (still low). The slightly higher risk score is acceptable, considering cookie manipulation could be misused if misconfigured, but no actual malicious activity is present.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions; the code remains benign.\n- **Scores consistency:** Consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate; no modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No.\n- **Errors/flaws/mistakes:** No.\n- **Scores review:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1. These are appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Scores consistency:** Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No.\n- **Errors/flaws/mistakes:** No.\n- **Scores review:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2. These seem reasonable.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Scores consistency:** Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No.\n- **Errors/flaws/mistakes:** No.\n- **Scores review:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** Correct.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Scores consistency:** Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is aligned with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify malware as 0, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) are reasonable given the cookie management functions, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activities are present.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n\n**Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, primarily due to potential misuse of cookie manipulation, but no active vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The code is a standard, benign utility for cookie management within the requests library.",
