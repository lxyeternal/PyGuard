{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for cookie management, extraction, creation, and conversion within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Functions that read input data include cookie parameters, request objects, and response headers. No external untrusted sources are directly accessed.",
  "sinks": "Cookie creation, extraction, and modification functions that manipulate cookie objects and headers; no data leaks or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (cookie parameters, request/response headers) flow into cookie creation and extraction functions; no network or system commands are executed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious logic, and no external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard cookie utility functions, including creating cookies, extracting cookies into a jar, converting cookies from dicts, and managing cookie jars. No obfuscation, malicious network activity, or backdoors are present. The functions follow typical patterns for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the benign utility nature. The code is well-structured, clear, and aligns with best practices for cookie management. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
