  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies within the requests library, including classes and functions for managing cookies, extracting cookies from responses, and converting cookies between different formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from HTTP request objects (e.g., URL, headers), cookie data (e.g., Morsel objects, dictionaries), and response headers (via response._original_response.msg). It also accesses environment variables and internal request data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations include setting or removing cookies by name, domain, and path, as well as creating or updating cookies using user-provided data. No direct sinks like network connections, file writes, or system commands are present. Cookie handling functions could be misused to manipulate cookie data.",
  "flows": "Input data from request objects and response headers flow into cookie extraction, creation, and management functions. User-supplied cookie data can be set or deleted in the cookie jar, which may influence subsequent request behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. It primarily offers cookie management utilities. There are no obfuscated language features or unusual dynamic execution. The methods follow expected patterns for cookie handling.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling utilities compatible with the requests library, including mock request/response classes, cookie extraction, cookie creation, and a dictionary-like interface for cookie jars. It allows cookies to be set, retrieved, deleted, and merged, supporting typical use cases. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are detected. Functions operate on data supplied by the user or the HTTP responses. The use of standard libraries and straightforward data manipulations suggests typical, safe cookie management operations. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a utility layer for cookie management in the requests library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It allows manipulation of cookies within expected parameters, with no hidden or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
