  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, creation, and manipulation of cookie jars.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.compat, ._internal_utils), standard libraries (calendar, copy, time, threading), and functions handling request and response objects, cookies, and headers.",
  "sinks": "Methods that handle cookie data, such as extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header, remove_cookie_by_name, and various CookieJar operations; potential for untrusted data flow exists if external inputs influence cookie handling.",
  "flows": "Extraction of cookies from response into jar, creation of cookies, setting cookies in jar, and retrieval of cookie headers for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of threading with fallback, standard cookie management functions, and compatibility wrappers are typical. No unusual or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for managing cookies in a requests environment, wrapping standard library classes for compatibility, and exposing dict-like interfaces for cookie jars. It includes functions to extract cookies from responses, create cookies with default parameters, and merge or remove cookies. No code appears to perform malicious activities such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network abuse. It primarily handles cookie data and headers in a controlled, expected manner. No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for cookie management in the requests library, with no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It facilitates cookie handling and compatibility but does not exhibit any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities based on the provided code.",
