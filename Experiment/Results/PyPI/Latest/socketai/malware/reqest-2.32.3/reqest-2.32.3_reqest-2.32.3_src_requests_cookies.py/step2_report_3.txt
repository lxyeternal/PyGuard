  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, following the structured approach.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. The code is a standard cookie utility module with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound, and the logic aligns with standard cookie management practices.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malware detected.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — very low, consistent with benign utility code.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk score: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for risk score > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable; scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  Zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The report correctly states the code is utility and compatibility-focused.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. The code is standard cookie handling code.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is correct; no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — still low, acceptable for utility code.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk score: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for > 0.5?**  \n  Not needed; scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Malware justification:**  \n  No malicious intent detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No; the report notes the code is benign.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a typical cookie utility implementation.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — suitable.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk score: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for > 0.5?**  \n  Not applicable.\n\n- **Malware justification:**  \n  No malware detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a standard cookie utility module.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The analysis is accurate.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — acceptable.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk score: 0.2 — consistent.\n\n- **Justification for > 0.5?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Malware justification:**  \n  No malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a typical utility for cookie handling.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — correct.  \n  - Security risk: 0.1 — suitable.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n  - Risk score: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n- **Justification for > 0.5?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Malware justification:**  \n  None.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  Yes.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious activity is evident in the code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the utility nature of the code with minimal security implications.\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is standard, well-structured, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal security risk, as it’s utility code handling cookies, which by itself is low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It contains no malware, no obfuscation, and poses minimal security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
