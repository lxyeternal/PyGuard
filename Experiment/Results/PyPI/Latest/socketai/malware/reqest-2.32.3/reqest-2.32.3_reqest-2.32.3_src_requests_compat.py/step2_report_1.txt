  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Compatibility layer with standard imports and optional libraries (chardet, simplejson).\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing or external commands; data flows are straightforward.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; code is purely infrastructural.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malware or security risk.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing compatibility and safe imports.  \n- No signs of malicious behavior or suspicious logic.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on environment detection and optional dependencies.  \n- No malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n**Report 4:**\n- Slightly higher confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.2) noted, but no actual malicious activity.  \n- Mentions dynamic imports and version detection, which are standard in compatibility code.\n\n**Justification for Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (code is straightforward)  \n- Security risk: 0.2 may be slightly overestimated; the code doesn't perform any risky operations. Given the lack of malicious activity, a risk score of 0.1 or 0.2 is acceptable but still low.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, standard compatibility boilerplate with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0  \n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation patterns observed.\n- **Security risk:** All reports indicate standard, well-understood compatibility code with no risky operations.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks evident)\n\n**Note:** The slight elevation in report 4's security risk score (0.2) seems unjustified given the code's nature. It should be adjusted downward to 0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard compatibility module used in many open-source projects. It performs version detection, safe imports, and compatibility adjustments without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should be **all zero**.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign infrastructure code with no security concerns.",
