{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing and detecting certain libraries such as urllib3, chardet, and simplejson, for use in a larger package.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (importlib, sys, collections, http, io, urllib), version detection, optional imports of third-party libraries (chardet, simplejson), and module attribute reads.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs; no network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The code only performs compatibility and import resolution tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on environment detection, compatibility handling, and safe imports of standard and third-party libraries. It attempts to import optional libraries safely, handles version detection for urllib3, and defines compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3. No user input processing, no network or system modifications, and no suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility and import utility module with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could lead to data leakage or system compromise.",
