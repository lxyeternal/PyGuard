  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling imports, version detection, and optional dependencies such as chardet and simplejson.",
  "sources": "Version detection from urllib3, import of optional libraries (chardet, simplejson), environment info via sys.version_info, standard library imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, external commands, or network interactions; purely infrastructural setup.",
  "flows": "Version info and optional library imports are used for compatibility adjustments; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Redefinition of 'str' and 'bytes' as identity functions is redundant but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility checks, safe imports, and environment detection. It uses try-except blocks for optional dependencies and version parsing, all typical for such modules. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The dynamic import logic is standard and not exploitable in this context. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves infrastructural purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, consistent with its purpose and implementation.",
