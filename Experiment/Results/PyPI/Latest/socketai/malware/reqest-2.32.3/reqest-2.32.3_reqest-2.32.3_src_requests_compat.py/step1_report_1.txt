{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing various libraries needed for HTTP requests and character detection.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from urllib3, imports optional libraries (chardet, simplejson), imports standard modules (sys, importlib, collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data or execute dangerous commands; imports are standard and for compatibility purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows are mainly version detection and library imports; no untrusted data flows or external command executions are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code strictly performs compatibility checks and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes Python version detection, attempts to import optional libraries (chardet, simplejson), and sets up various compatibility imports for URL handling and JSON parsing. All operations are standard for maintaining cross-version compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code uses try-except blocks appropriately, with no suspicious or hidden behavior. It is purely infrastructural code meant for compatibility and library loading.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign compatibility layer that does not contain malware or security risks. It performs standard library imports and version checks without any suspicious behavior.",
