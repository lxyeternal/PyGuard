{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as compatibility with different versions of urllib3 and optional character detection libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard and third-party libraries, dynamic import of chardet or charset_normalizer, version detection for urllib3, and sys.version_info for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes to files, executes untrusted code, or interacts with external inputs directly, apart from import statements and version checks.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up environment compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes dynamic import attempts and version detection, which are standard but could be exploited if manipulated, though there is no evidence of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script focuses on environment setup, compatibility, and version detection, with conditional imports and feature detection. It imports standard libraries and handles optional dependencies gracefully. There are no suspicious or malicious operations such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The dynamic import logic and version checks are typical for compatibility layers. The code structure appears clean and intentional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, handling library imports and version detection. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
