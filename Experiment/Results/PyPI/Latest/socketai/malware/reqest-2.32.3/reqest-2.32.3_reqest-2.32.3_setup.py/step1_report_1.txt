    "setup() call uses data from 'about' and files for package setup"

  "anomalies": [
    "Use of exec() to execute code read from __version__.py, which could be malicious if the file is compromised",
    "No validation or sanitization of __version__.py content before exec()",
    "No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected",
    "Use of os.system() for distribution commands, which could be exploited if command arguments are manipulated (though unlikely in this context)"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks with a notable use of exec() to dynamically load package metadata from an external file, which presents a potential security risk if that file is compromised. The os.system() calls for publishing are common but could be misused if parameters are altered, though no such manipulation appears in this code. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code structure is typical for a setup script, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script with a potential security concern in the use of exec() to load version information. No malicious intent or malware behaviors are evident. The overall security risk is low, with a minor concern regarding exec() if the source file is compromised.",
