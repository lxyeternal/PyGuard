{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, primarily handling environment checks, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "sys.argv, os.system, open() calls, exec() for version info, file reads for __version__.py and README.md",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls, exec() function, file reading operations, setup() function parameters",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments -> triggers os.system() commands; file content -> exec() assigns values; setup() uses metadata from files",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute contents of __version__.py, which could contain arbitrary code; os.system() commands for publishing, which could be misused if modified; no input validation or sanitization present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment validation and package setup tasks. The use of exec() to evaluate version info from a file is standard but could execute malicious code if that file is tampered with. The os.system() calls for publishing are common in setup scripts, but could be exploited if the command is altered or executed in a malicious environment. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is evident. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected. The code itself appears to be a typical setup script with standard practices, aside from the potential risk posed by exec().",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with standard package management functions. The only noteworthy concern is the use of exec() to evaluate version info, which could execute malicious code if the source __version__.py is compromised. Overall, no direct malicious behavior or malware is present. The script does not exhibit malicious intent but should ensure the integrity of the __version__.py file.",
