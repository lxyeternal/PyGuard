  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard setup.py with exec() to load version info; no malicious code detected; no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The primary concern is the use of exec() on __version__.py, which could be malicious if that file is compromised. However, in typical setups, this is standard practice, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Verdict:** The score seems reasonable. The malware score is 0, which aligns with no malicious activity. Security risk is low but acknowledges exec() risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the exec() on __version__.py, no malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning as above. No malware or obfuscation. The risk score is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard setup with exec() on version file, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.4.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.4) perhaps reflecting the use of exec(), but still no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; standard setup script, exec() on version info, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports. No malware or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; no malicious activity, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning applies.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which is appropriate given the code. No signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.2 to 0.4), mainly due to the use of exec() on external files, which is a known risk if those files are compromised. No evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The use of exec() is a known pattern in setup.py scripts, but it warrants ensuring the integrity of the __version__.py file.\n- No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor concern about exec(), but standard practice in setup scripts)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical setup.py script with a minor security concern regarding the use of exec() to load version info. No malware or malicious intent is evident. The current scores are appropriate and conservative.\n\n**Final note:** Ensure the integrity of the __version__.py file to mitigate risks associated with exec().",
