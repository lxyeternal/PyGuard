  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'requests' Python library, defining dependencies, metadata, and publishing commands.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__version__.py', reading README.md, command-line arguments for publishing.",
  "sinks": "exec() evaluates version file, os.system() executes publish commands.",
  "flows": "exec() reads and executes code from version file; command-line argument triggers os.system() commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external version file; reliance on static os.system() commands for publishing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with typical dependencies and metadata. The primary security concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could execute malicious code if the version file is compromised. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The os.system() calls are used for publishing and are standard but could pose risks if manipulated. Overall, the script is straightforward with minor security considerations related to exec().",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of exec() to evaluate an external file, which could be exploited if the file is tampered with. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score should be low (~0.2), reflecting the exec() concern, but overall the code is safe for use if the version file integrity is maintained.",
