  "purpose": "Send a GET request to a hardcoded webhook URL using subprocess to invoke curl.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URL in the function send_to_webhook()",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run() call executing curl, which performs the HTTP GET request",
  "flows": "The function constructs the URL, subprocess executes curl with the URL, and captures output or error",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to call curl instead of native Python HTTP libraries; URL contains 'ImBad' which may be suspicious; no user input involved",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple, static HTTP GET request via subprocess calling curl. No untrusted input or data exfiltration is present. The use of subprocess with curl is unconventional and inefficient but not malicious. The URL's 'ImBad' segment suggests testing or placeholder use, not malicious intent. No obfuscation or hidden code is detected. Malware score is low (around 0.1), reflecting suspicion due to URL naming and method but no actual malicious payloads. Security risk is moderate (around 0.3-0.4) mainly because of the suspicious URL and indirect request method, but no active threats are evident. The code does not perform malicious actions like data theft, backdoors, or destructive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward HTTP GET request via an external call. The main concerns are the unconventional method and the suspicious URL segment, which could be used in malicious contexts but currently show no malicious activity. The malware score should remain low, and the security risk moderate, primarily due to the URL's naming and the method used. Refactoring to use native Python HTTP libraries is recommended for clarity and security.",
