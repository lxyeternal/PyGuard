  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward HTTP GET request via an external call. The main concerns are the unconventional method and the suspicious URL segment, which could be used in malicious contexts but currently show no malicious activity. The malware score should remain low, and the security risk moderate, primarily due to the URL's naming and the method used. Refactoring to use native Python HTTP libraries is recommended for clarity and security."
