  "conclusion": "The code pattern of invoking 'send_to_webhook' during setup is suspicious and could be malicious if the function performs harmful actions like data exfiltration or remote control. The actual risk depends on the implementation of 'send_to_webhook'. The current pattern warrants caution, and further review of the function's code is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."
