{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup process that, after installation, automatically calls an external function 'send_to_webhook' from the 'akatest.send_webhook' module, potentially executing network activity during package installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the package setup configuration and imports 'send_to_webhook' during post-install.",
  "sinks": "The 'send_to_webhook' function, invoked during installation, likely performs network requests which could lead to data exfiltration or remote command execution.",
  "flows": "Source: post-install hook; Sink: execution of 'send_to_webhook' which may perform network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The invocation of an external function during setup without user consent or validation; no obfuscation present; potential for malicious behavior depending on 'send_to_webhook' implementation.",
  "analysis": "The setup script employs a custom install command that calls 'send_to_webhook' after installation, which is suspicious due to its potential for network activity during package setup. The implementation of 'send_to_webhook' is not provided, so its behavior (benign or malicious) cannot be confirmed. The pattern of executing external code at install time is a common tactic for malicious packages or tracking. The code itself is straightforward and not obfuscated. Given the pattern, the malware score should be moderate, and the security risk elevated, but without concrete evidence, the scores should reflect suspicion rather than certainty.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern of invoking 'send_to_webhook' during setup is suspicious and could be malicious if the function performs harmful actions like data exfiltration or remote control. The actual risk depends on the implementation of 'send_to_webhook'. The current pattern warrants caution, and further review of the function's code is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
