{
  "purpose": "Define a setup configuration for the 'akatest' Python package with a custom post-installation hook.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file for long_description and imports 'send_to_webhook' from 'akatest.send_webhook' during installation.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'send_to_webhook()' after installation potentially acts as a sink, executing external code upon package installation.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the setup script executes 'send_to_webhook()' which could perform network requests or other actions.",
  "anomalies": "The 'send_to_webhook()' function is invoked automatically after installation without any visible user input or configuration; the function source is not shown, which could be suspicious if malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install command that, after completing the normal installation process, calls 'send_to_webhook' from 'akatest.send_webhook'. This could be used to trigger a remote webhook, possibly for malicious purposes such as notifying an attacker of installation or exfiltrating data if 'send_to_webhook' is malicious. The setup script itself appears standard but includes a potentially risky post-install step. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns visible here; however, the reliance on an external function that is called automatically during install is noteworthy. The code does not include any obfuscated or complex logic, but the behavior depends on the implementation of 'send_to_webhook'. If 'send_to_webhook' is malicious, this could constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code appears legitimate in structure but includes a post-install hook that executes an external function, 'send_to_webhook', which could be malicious if implemented with malicious intent. Without knowing the implementation of 'send_to_webhook', the risk cannot be fully assessed, but this pattern is often used to trigger remote actions upon package installation, which is suspicious.",
