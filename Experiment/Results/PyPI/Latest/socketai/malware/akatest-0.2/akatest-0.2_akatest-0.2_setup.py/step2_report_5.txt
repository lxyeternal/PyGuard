  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Confirmation & Functionality:**\n- The code defines a custom `PostInstallCommand` that, after executing the standard install, imports and calls `send_to_webhook()` from `akatest.send_webhook`.\n- The `send_to_webhook()` function is invoked during the post-install process, which is executed automatically upon package installation.\n- The implementation of `send_to_webhook()` is not provided, so its behavior (benign or malicious) cannot be definitively determined from this snippet alone.\n\n**Issues and Logical Flaws:**\n- The core concern is the automatic invocation of an external function (`send_to_webhook()`) during package installation without user consent or explicit configuration.\n- This pattern can be exploited for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, tracking, or triggering unwanted actions.\n- The code itself appears straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or hidden logic, but the behavior depends entirely on the external function's implementation.\n\n**Scores Review:**\n- **Malware Score (0.5):** The reports assign a moderate malware score, which is justified if `send_to_webhook()` performs malicious actions. Since the function's behavior is unknown, a score of 0.5 reflects potential risk but not certainty.\n- **Security Risk (0.5 - 0.6):** The reports generally assign a moderate security risk, which seems appropriate given the automatic network call during install.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** No obfuscation is present; the code is clear.\n\n**Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- Given the pattern of executing external code during setup, the risk is non-trivial, especially if `send_to_webhook()` performs malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system fingerprinting.\n- The lack of user consent and the potential for abuse justify a risk score of 0.6 or higher if malicious intent is suspected.\n\n**Malware Score Justification:**\n- The malware score of 0.5 is reasonable if `send_to_webhook()` could be malicious. Without the implementation, we cannot confirm maliciousness, but the pattern is suspicious enough to warrant concern.\n- If `send_to_webhook()` is benign (e.g., just notifying a server), the malware score should be lower; if malicious, it should be higher.\n\n**Potential Assumptions and Claims:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the call to `send_to_webhook()` could be malicious if implemented with malicious intent.\n- There are no assumptions in the code snippet itself; the suspicion hinges on the external function's behavior.\n\n**Consistency of Scores:**\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the analysis, reflecting moderate concern due to the external network call during setup.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment and Recommendations:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.5 (moderate, depending on implementation)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk:** 0.6 (due to automatic external network activity during install)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code pattern—calling an external webhook during package installation—is suspicious and could be malicious if `send_to_webhook()` performs harmful actions. The overall security risk is moderate, but the actual maliciousness depends on the implementation of `send_to_webhook()`. This pattern warrants caution, especially in supply chain security contexts.\n\n**Actionable Advice:**\n- Review the implementation of `send_to_webhook()`.\n- Avoid automatic external calls during package installation unless explicitly justified.\n- Consider adding user confirmation or configuration options before executing such network requests.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code itself is straightforward but employs a potentially dangerous pattern. The risk scores assigned are reasonable, but vigilance is advised until the behavior of `send_to_webhook()` is confirmed.",
