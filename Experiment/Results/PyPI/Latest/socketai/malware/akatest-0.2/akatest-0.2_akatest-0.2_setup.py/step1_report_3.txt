{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom setup process for the 'akatest' package, which includes executing a webhook call after installation.",
  "sources": "The import of 'send_to_webhook' from 'akatest.send_webhook' and its invocation in the run() method of PostInstallCommand.",
  "sinks": "The call to send_to_webhook(), which is assumed to send data over the network to a webhook URL.",
  "flows": "During installation, the custom run() method imports and calls send_to_webhook(), which likely makes an outbound network request.",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically calls a webhook after installation without user interaction or explicit consent. The webhook URL or behavior depends on the implementation of send_to_webhook, which isn't provided here.",
  "analysis": "The script extends setuptools to include a post-install hook that calls send_to_webhook() after installation. The code appears straightforward and does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic in the visible code. However, the automatic invocation of a network request post-installation is unusual and potentially malicious if the webhook performs unwanted actions, data exfiltration, or contacts suspicious servers. The actual maliciousness depends on the implementation of send_to_webhook, which isn't included. The code itself is simple and not obfuscated. It raises some security concerns due to the network call without user notice, but no malicious code is explicitly visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard setup with an unusual post-install network call via send_to_webhook(). Without the implementation details of send_to_webhook(), it's unclear if this is malicious, but the automatic execution of a network request after installation is suspicious. Overall, the code itself is not inherently malicious but could be used maliciously depending on send_to_webhook's behavior.",
