  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration with a custom post-installation hook that executes a webhook call.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'send_to_webhook' from akatest.send_webhook within the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Call to 'send_to_webhook()' which may perform an external network request.",
  "flows": "After installation, the 'run' method in PostInstallCommand triggers 'send_to_webhook()', potentially sending data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The invocation of 'send_to_webhook()' immediately after installation without any input parameters or validation. No visible payload or URL configuration in this code snippet; relies on external module.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py defines a custom installation command that, after completing the standard package installation, calls 'send_to_webhook()' from the 'akatest.send_webhook' module. This indicates an automatic network request post-installation, which could be used for benign purposes like notification or malicious tracking. There are no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data in this snippet. The external 'send_to_webhook' function is critical to understand for full security assessment, but based on this code alone, it performs a network request after installation without user consent or validation. This behavior can be considered suspicious as it executes external code or network activity immediately upon install, which could be leveraged for malicious tracking or data exfiltration if the 'send_to_webhook' function is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a post-install hook that automatically calls an external webhook, which is suspicious. Without further context of 'send_to_webhook', it poses a potential security and privacy risk, especially if the webhook transmits sensitive data or is controlled by an untrusted party.",
