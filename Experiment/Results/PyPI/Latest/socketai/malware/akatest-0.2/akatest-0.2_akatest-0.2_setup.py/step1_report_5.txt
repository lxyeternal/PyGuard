{
  "purpose": "Defines a setup script for a Python package 'akatest' that customizes the installation process to run a webhook call after installation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, the run method of the PostInstallCommand class, and the send_to_webhook function call.",
  "sinks": "send_to_webhook() function call, which likely makes an external network request.",
  "flows": "Upon package installation, the custom run method executes, calling send_to_webhook() which probably sends data over the network.",
  "anomalies": "The code triggers an external webhook call during installation without any condition or user consent, which could be used for tracking or malicious purposes. No input validation or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py script creates a custom installation command that, after completing the standard installation, imports and calls send_to_webhook() from akatest.send_webhook. This behavior is embedded in the post-installation step and involves executing code that likely performs an HTTP request. The script itself does not contain the implementation of send_to_webhook, so its behavior depends on its source. The design suggests an intention to notify or track installations, which can be benign or malicious depending on context. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are evident. The call to send_to_webhook during setup is unusual and could be exploited to send data or trigger malicious actions if send_to_webhook is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior by executing a network request during package installation via send_to_webhook(), which could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The core setup script appears straightforward, but the post-install hook warrants caution. Overall, the code’s primary concern is the automatic webhook call post-installation, which is suspicious.",
