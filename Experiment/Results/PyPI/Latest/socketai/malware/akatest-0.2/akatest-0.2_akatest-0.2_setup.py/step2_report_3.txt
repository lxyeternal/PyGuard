  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The setup.py defines a custom install command (`PostInstallCommand`) that, after completing the standard installation, imports and calls `send_to_webhook()` from `akatest.send_webhook`.\n- The `send_to_webhook()` function is invoked automatically during package installation, with no visible user interaction, validation, or safeguards.\n- The actual implementation of `send_to_webhook()` is not provided, so its behavior (benign or malicious) is unknown.\n- The code itself is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns directly visible, but the pattern of executing external code during install is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  The code executes `send_to_webhook()` during install, which is present and correctly invoked. No issues in code syntax or logic.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Potential flaw:**  \n  The automatic call to an external function (`send_to_webhook()`) during setup without user consent or validation is a security concern, especially if the function is malicious or contacts untrusted servers.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score (0.2 - 0.5):**  \n  The reports assign a malware score of 0.2 to 0.5, citing potential for network activity.  \n  Given the pattern, unless `send_to_webhook()` is known to be malicious, the code itself is not inherently malicious but could be exploited.  \n  **My assessment:**  \n  - Without evidence of malicious behavior, I would assign a malware score around **0.2** (low, but not zero), reflecting the suspicious pattern but lack of concrete malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score (0):**  \n  All reports agree on no obfuscation.  \n  **My assessment:**  \n  Confirmed as 0.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The reports range from 0.4 to 0.6, citing the post-install network call as suspicious.  \n  **My assessment:**  \n  - Given the potential for abuse, I would assign a risk score of **0.4 to 0.5**.  \n  - Since the code pattern is straightforward but suspicious, I will settle on **0.45**.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  If `send_to_webhook()` is malicious, it could exfiltrate data, trigger unwanted actions, or contact malicious servers.  \n  - Since the implementation is unknown, but the pattern is suspicious, a malware score of **0.2** reflects some concern but not definitive malware.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  The automatic network call post-installation can be exploited for malicious purposes, such as tracking, data exfiltration, or command-and-control communication.  \n  - Given the potential impact, a score of **0.45** is justified.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume `send_to_webhook()` may be malicious.  \n- This is plausible, but without the implementation, we cannot confirm.  \n- The pattern is common in malicious packages, but also in legitimate ones that notify or register installations.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in noting the suspicious post-install network call.  \n- The assigned scores align with the pattern and potential risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n| Aspect | Score | Justification |\n|---|---|---|\n| Malware | **0.2** | Pattern of external network call during install; no evidence of malicious code in provided snippet. |\n| Obfuscated | **0** | No obfuscation observed. |\n| Risk | **0.45** | Post-install network activity can be exploited; warrants caution but not definitive maliciousness. |\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code pattern is suspicious due to the automatic invocation of `send_to_webhook()` during installation. While the code itself appears benign, the behavior could be exploited maliciously depending on the implementation of `send_to_webhook()`. The scores reflect this cautious stance.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Further review of the actual `send_to_webhook()` implementation is necessary for a definitive malware verdict.",
