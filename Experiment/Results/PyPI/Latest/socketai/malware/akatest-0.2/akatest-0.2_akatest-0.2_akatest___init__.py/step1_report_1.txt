{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'send_to_webhook' function from a local module 'send_webhook'.",
  "sources": "The code reads a function definition from a local module file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible as this is only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident in this single line.",
  "analysis": "The snippet imports a function from a local module. There is no indication of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leakage. The function name suggests it sends data to a webhook, which could be used maliciously, but alone, the import statement does not indicate any malicious intent. Since the code is very limited, it provides no additional context to assess behavior or intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard import of a function from a local module. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
