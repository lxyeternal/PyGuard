{
  "purpose": "Importing the function 'send_to_webhook' from the local module 'send_webhook'.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a local module, which is not inherently a data source but indicates potential for webhook-related activity.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the 'send_to_webhook' function could send data to external servers, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this single import statement; the actual data flow depends on how 'send_to_webhook' is used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident within this line alone.",
  "analysis": "This code imports a function likely designed to send data to a webhook endpoint. Without additional context, this line alone is typical in Python projects and does not exhibit malicious patterns. The security implications depend on how and where 'send_to_webhook' is used and what data it handles, but this cannot be assessed from the import statement alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. It does not raise security concerns by itself, but the actual behavior depends on subsequent usage of 'send_to_webhook'.",
