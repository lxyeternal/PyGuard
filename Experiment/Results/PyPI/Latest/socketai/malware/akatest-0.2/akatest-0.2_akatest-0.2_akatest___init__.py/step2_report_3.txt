  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the evidence and scoring:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus solely on a single import statement: `from .send_webhook import send_to_webhook`.\n- None of the reports provide evidence of actual malicious activity, data flow, or usage of the imported function.\n- The code snippet is minimal, and without context on how `send_to_webhook` is used, it’s impossible to assess malicious intent or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The code is a simple import statement; no issues are evident.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** No errors or flaws are apparent in this isolated import statement.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware score: consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the lack of evidence.\n  - Security risk: very low (0.1 or 0.2), which seems reasonable given the context.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, which is correct.\n  \nNo adjustments are necessary based on the code snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Confidence:** 0.5, which is moderate; reasonable given the minimal info.\n- **Malware:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence (0.8) given the potential for misuse, but still correctly notes that the import alone is harmless.\n- **Malware:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk:** 0.2, still low, which seems reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Fair.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to Report 2, with high confidence (0.9), noting potential for the function to send data externally.\n- **Malware:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk:** 0.1, reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- Both correctly identify that the import is benign in isolation.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 and 0.7), which is appropriate.\n- Malware scores are 0.\n- Risk scores are very low (0.1), consistent with the lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the evidence.\n- The main limitation is the lack of context on how `send_to_webhook` is used later in the code, which could influence risk and malware scores if actual usage involves data exfiltration or malicious behavior.\n- Given only the import statement, **the scores should remain very low** across malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Scores for malware, obfuscated, and risk:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n  - **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, just due to potential misuse if used maliciously later)\n\n- **Justification:**  \n  - The code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.  \n  - The potential for malicious activity depends entirely on subsequent usage, which is not provided here.  \n  - The scores should reflect the current evidence, which indicates no immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessments.\n- The current scores are appropriate given the limited context.\n- The true risk and malware potential can only be assessed when the usage of `send_to_webhook` is known.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis conservative approach aligns with the evidence and best practices in supply chain security review.",
