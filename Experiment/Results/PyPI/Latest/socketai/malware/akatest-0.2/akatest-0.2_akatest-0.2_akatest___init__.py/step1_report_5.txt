  "purpose": "Importing the function 'send_to_webhook' from a local module 'send_webhook'.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function from a local module; no external input reading or data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this single line; no data output, network communication, or external data handling is shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this isolated import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs a relative import of a function named 'send_to_webhook' from a local module. There are no data inputs, network connections, or other behaviors evident. The import statement itself is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. Without additional context or code that uses this function, it is not possible to determine malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign code fragment, likely part of a larger codebase. No suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from this snippet.",
