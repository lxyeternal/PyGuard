  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence provided, the logic behind the scores, and the potential security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports concern a simple import statement: `from .send_webhook import send_to_webhook`.\n- The code is minimal, with no data flows, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The function name `send_to_webhook` suggests a potential for external communication, but the import alone does not execute any such behavior.\n- The confidence levels are generally high (0.7 to 0.9), which is appropriate given the limited context.\n- Malware scores are zero across all reports, which aligns with the fact that an import statement by itself cannot be malicious.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable since the risk depends on how the function is used, not on the import statement itself.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - Confirmed: The code only imports a function; no issues or malicious code are present in this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the import statement alone does not demonstrate malicious intent.\n   - They acknowledge that the potential for malicious activity depends on how `send_to_webhook` is used later, which is accurate.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; high confidence in benign nature, low malware, and low security risk.\n   - No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since the import alone does not pose a security risk, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The scores of 0.1 to 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware scores:**\n   - Correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions, correctly stating that malicious activity depends on subsequent usage, not the import statement itself.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate given the limited context.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks from this import statement alone.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, primarily potential if misused later)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The import statement itself is harmless, and the scores reflect that appropriately. The real security concern would arise from how `send_to_webhook` is used elsewhere, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.",
