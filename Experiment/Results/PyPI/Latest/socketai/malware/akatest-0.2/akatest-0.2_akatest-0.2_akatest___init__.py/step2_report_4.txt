  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .send_webhook import send_to_webhook\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code only imports a function `send_to_webhook` from a local module `send_webhook`.\n- There are no other code actions, data flows, or behaviors visible in this snippet.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, anomalies, or obfuscation. The confidence is 0.5, indicating moderate certainty.\n- **Score justification:** The score of malware = 0 is appropriate. Security risk = 0 also makes sense since the code alone does not perform any actions.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly states that the import alone is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher confidence (0.8). It notes that the function could be used maliciously but emphasizes that the import itself is harmless.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0; security risk is low (0.2), which seems reasonable given the context.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate; no issues here.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, with a confidence of 0.9. The analysis correctly indicates that the import alone isn't suspicious.\n- **Score justification:** Malware remains 0; security risk is low (0.1).\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Also a high confidence (0.9). The analysis remains consistent with previous reports.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0; security risk 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.7), but still indicates no suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **Code behavior:** The import statement itself does not execute any code or data transfer.\n- **Potential misuse:** The function `send_to_webhook` could be used elsewhere in the codebase to send data externally, which might be malicious if misused. However, the import alone does not confirm malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** No evidence from the import statement alone.\n- **Security risk:** The risk depends on how `send_to_webhook` is used, not on the import itself.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is demonstrated.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0.\n- The overall security risk should stay low, reflecting that this snippet alone is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, based on potential for misuse in larger context, but not in this snippet)\n\n**Summary:** The import statement is standard and does not exhibit any security issues on its own. Any potential malicious activity would depend on how the `send_to_webhook` function is used elsewhere, which cannot be inferred from this isolated line.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always review the usage of imported functions in the broader codebase to assess actual security implications.",
