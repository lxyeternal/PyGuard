{
  "purpose": "This code imports the function 'send_to_webhook' from a local module 'send_webhook'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement to include a function from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; it does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; the import itself does not execute any code or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no execution, data transfer, or suspicious behavior. The function name 'send_to_webhook' suggests potential external communication, but the import alone does not perform any such action. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk—are appropriate given the limited context. The overall assessment indicates that this snippet is benign, and any malicious activity would depend on how 'send_to_webhook' is used elsewhere in the codebase. Without additional context, the import is considered safe.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks on its own. The scores are consistent with this assessment, and no further action is necessary unless subsequent code demonstrates malicious use.",
