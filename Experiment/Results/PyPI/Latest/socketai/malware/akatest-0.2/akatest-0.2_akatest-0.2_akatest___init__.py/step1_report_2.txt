{
  "purpose": "Importing a function named send_to_webhook from a local module send_webhook",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; import statement references a local module",
  "sinks": "Potential use of send_to_webhook function, which could send data externally",
  "flows": "Code could call send_to_webhook with data, potentially leading to data exfiltration if misused",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies in the import statement itself; no hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement, bringing in a function from a local module. Without additional context or usage, there are no malicious indicators. The function name suggests it sends data to a webhook, which could be benign or malicious depending on how it's used elsewhere. Since no data is being sent or processed here, the code by itself appears harmless.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment alone does not show malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard import statement with no suspicious activity detected.",
