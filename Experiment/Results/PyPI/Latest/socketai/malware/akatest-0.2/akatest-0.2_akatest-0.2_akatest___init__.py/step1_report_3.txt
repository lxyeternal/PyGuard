{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'send_to_webhook' function from a local module 'send_webhook'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads the 'send_webhook' module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the use of 'send_to_webhook' if invoked elsewhere, which could send data externally.",
  "flows": "The code imports a function that likely sends data to an external webhook; flow depends on its usage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present in this single line; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a local module. It does not include any execution or data handling itself. The presence of the import suggests the function 'send_to_webhook' may be used later in the code, which could potentially send data externally. However, this snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard practice to organize code into modules. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
