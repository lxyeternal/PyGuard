  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code snippet under review:**\n```python\nfrom .send_webhook import send_to_webhook\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. Presence of Issues in the Code\n- **Confirmed:** The code is a straightforward import statement. It imports a function `send_to_webhook` from a local module `send_webhook`.\n- **No anomalies or suspicious behavior** are evident in this line alone.\n- **No data flows, sinks, or sources** are present within this minimal snippet.\n\n### 2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports\n- The reports are consistent: all acknowledge that this is a simple import statement with no immediate malicious activity.\n- They correctly note that **without additional context or usage**, the code cannot be deemed malicious.\n- No errors or logical flaws are present in the reports themselves.\n\n### 3. Scores Given to Each Issue\n- **Confidence scores** range from 0.5 to 0.9, which seem reasonable given the limited context.\n- **Malware scores** are all zero, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Security risk scores** are low (~0.1 to 0.2), which is appropriate for a benign import statement.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments are necessary based solely on this import statement.\n\n### 4. Justification for Higher Risk Scores (>0.5)\n- Since **all reports assign malware scores of 0**, there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Risk scores** are also low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Higher scores** would only be justified if there was evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data exfiltration, none of which is present here.\n\n### 5. Malware Score Consideration\n- The **malware score of 0** is appropriate.\n- The function name `send_to_webhook` could be used maliciously in context, but the import alone does not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n### 6. Challenging Assumptions\n- The reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about the function’s behavior.\n- They acknowledge that the actual security implications depend on how `send_to_webhook` is used elsewhere, which is appropriate.\n\n### 7. Consistency of Scores\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: low confidence, no malware, minimal security risk.\n- No contradictions are observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.**\n- **The code is benign on its own**, and the lack of context prevents any definitive security risk assessment beyond the import statement.\n- **The malware score should remain at 0**, and the risk score should stay low unless further code shows malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 | No evidence of malicious code or behavior in the snippet.  |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 | Code is clear and straightforward.                          |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1               | Minimal risk; depends on how the function is used later.   |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe import statement itself is not suspicious. Any potential malicious activity hinges on how `send_to_webhook` is used elsewhere in the codebase. Without that context, the safest stance is that this is a benign, standard import with no immediate security concerns.",
