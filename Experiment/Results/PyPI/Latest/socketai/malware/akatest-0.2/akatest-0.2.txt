      "conclusion": "The code pattern of invoking 'send_to_webhook' during setup is suspicious and could be malicious if the function performs harmful actions like data exfiltration or remote control. The actual risk depends on the implementation of 'send_to_webhook'. The current pattern warrants caution, and further review of the function's code is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward HTTP GET request via an external call. The main concerns are the unconventional method and the suspicious URL segment, which could be used in malicious contexts but currently show no malicious activity. The malware score should remain low, and the security risk moderate, primarily due to the URL's naming and the method used. Refactoring to use native Python HTTP libraries is recommended for clarity and security."
