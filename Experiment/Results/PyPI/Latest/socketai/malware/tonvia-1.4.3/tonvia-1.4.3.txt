      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the Telegram URL, which could be used for social engineering but does not affect the code's security. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent by collecting sensitive seed phrases and transmitting them unencrypted to an external service with hardcoded credentials. It should be classified as highly malicious, with maximum malware and security risk scores due to the severity of data exfiltration and insecure handling."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal and appears benign. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with the primary concern being the trustworthiness of 'tonvia' and its function 'a()'. Without further information about 'a()', the risk remains low but not negligible. The scores and analysis are consistent and justified based on the provided code."
