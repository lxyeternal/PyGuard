  "purpose": "The code prompts the user for 12 seed phrases and sends them as a message via Telegram bot.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function for seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Telegram API endpoint to send a message containing seed phrases.",
  "flows": "Input from user -> stored in 'secret_words' -> concatenated into 'message' -> sent via requests.post() to Telegram API.",
  "anomalies": "The code collects sensitive seed phrases and transmits them over the internet without any encryption or obfuscation. The seed phrases are hardcoded as user input, and the bot token is embedded directly in the code. No validation beyond length check. No error handling or security controls. No indication of purpose beyond transmission; potentially malicious intent to exfiltrate seed phrases.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to solicit 12 seed phrases from the user and send them to a Telegram chat via a bot API. The hardcoded bot token and chat ID are used directly. The seed phrases are collected through a blocking input prompt, then joined into a message string and sent over an HTTPS request. There are no security measures to protect the data in transit or at rest. The collection and transmission of seed phrases indicate malicious intent or at least highly suspicious behavior, as this is a common tactic for theft of sensitive wallet data. The lack of validation and error handling suggests minimal concern for robustness or user security. Overall, the code's behavior aligns with data exfiltration of sensitive information.",
  "conclusion": "This code collects highly sensitive seed phrases from the user and transmits them to an external Telegram chat, indicating malicious intent related to seed phrase theft. It is a high-risk, potentially malicious script designed for data exfiltration.",
