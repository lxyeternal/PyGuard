  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them as a message via Telegram's bot API.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function capturing seed phrases",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Telegram API with seed phrases in the payload",
  "flows": "Input (seed phrases) -> message string -> POST request to Telegram API endpoint",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID, sensitive data transmission via unencrypted HTTP request (though HTTPS is used), no validation or encryption of seed phrases before transmission",
  "analysis": "The code prompts the user to input 12 seed words, which are stored in 'secret_words'. It checks if exactly 12 words are provided; otherwise, it exits. It then constructs a message containing these seed words and sends it to a Telegram chat using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. The direct transmission of seed phrases over the network to an external service, especially with hardcoded credentials, poses a significant security risk, as this is an obvious target for malicious actors. The code does not include any obfuscation or complex logic that would suggest obfuscation or malicious intent beyond data exfiltration. The use of the Telegram API to send sensitive seed data indicates malicious intent if used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This code exfiltrates seed phrases by sending them to a Telegram chat using hardcoded credentials. It appears to be designed for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive user data, rather than benign functionality. The use of hardcoded secrets and transmission of sensitive data over the network constitutes a serious security risk.",
