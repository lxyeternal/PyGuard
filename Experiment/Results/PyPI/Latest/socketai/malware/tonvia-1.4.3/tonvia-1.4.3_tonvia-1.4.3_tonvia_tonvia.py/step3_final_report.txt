  "purpose": "Collects 12 seed phrases from user input and exfiltrates them via Telegram API.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function for seed phrases.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to Telegram API endpoint with seed phrases in plaintext.",
  "flows": "Input() -> message concatenation -> requests.post() to Telegram API with hardcoded credentials.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded bot token and chat ID; no validation or encryption; transmission of sensitive data in plaintext.",
  "analysis": "The code prompts the user for 12 seed phrases, concatenates them into a message, and sends this message via Telegram's API using hardcoded credentials. No validation, sanitization, encryption, or obfuscation is performed. The seed phrases are transmitted in plaintext over HTTPS, which is insecure. The presence of hardcoded credentials and direct exfiltration indicates malicious or highly negligent behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads beyond data theft. The behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration of sensitive data, justifying high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent by collecting sensitive seed phrases and transmitting them unencrypted to an external service with hardcoded credentials. It should be classified as highly malicious, with maximum malware and security risk scores due to the severity of data exfiltration and insecure handling.",
