  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them via a Telegram bot message.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via the input() function to obtain seed phrases.",
  "targets": "Requests to the Telegram Bot API endpoint to send a message containing the seed phrases.",
  "flows": "User input of seed phrases -> concatenation into message -> POST request to Telegram API with seed phrases.",
  "anomalies": "The seed phrases are taken directly from user input without validation or encryption, and are sent over the network in plaintext. The bot token is hardcoded in the source code, which is a security concern. The code prompts for seed phrases but does not mask input, increasing risk of exposure. There is no sanitization or verification of input beyond count check.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that prompts the user for 12 seed phrases. These are collected into a list and joined into a message string. The message is then sent via a POST request to the Telegram API using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. There is no validation beyond ensuring 12 phrases are entered. The seed phrases are sent in plaintext over the network. Hardcoded credentials, such as the bot token, pose a security risk. The code does not contain obfuscated code or malicious functions, but it handles sensitive information insecurely by transmitting seed phrases directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to collect and transmit sensitive seed phrases via Telegram, which poses serious security and privacy risks. It could be used maliciously to exfiltrate seed phrases without user awareness. The hardcoded bot token and plaintext transmission are concerning. Overall, this code exhibits potentially malicious behavior related to secret data exfiltration.",
