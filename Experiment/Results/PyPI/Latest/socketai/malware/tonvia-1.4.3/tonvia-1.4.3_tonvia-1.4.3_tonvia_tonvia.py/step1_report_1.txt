  "purpose": "The code prompts the user for 12 seed phrases and sends them as a message via Telegram bot API.",
  "sources": "User input from the input() function capturing seed phrases.",
  "kills": "Untrusted data from user input used directly in the message payload sent to Telegram API.",
  "flows": "User input (seed phrases) -> message string -> POST request to Telegram API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The seed phrases are taken as input and sent directly to an external service without validation, logging, or encryption. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded, which is sensitive information. No validation or sanitization is performed on input. The code leaks seed phrases over a network in plaintext. No error handling or security measures are implemented.",
  "analysis": "The code collects 12 seed phrases directly from user input, assuming user input is trusted but not verified or encrypted. The seed phrases are concatenated into a message string and sent via a Telegram bot API call. The bot token and chat ID are hardcoded in the source code, which is a security risk. The code does not validate or sanitize input beyond checking the number of seed phrases, and it sends the data over HTTPS without additional encryption. There is no logging, error handling, or measures to prevent misuse. The data flow involves untrusted user input directly being transmitted to an external service, exposing sensitive information. No malicious code or backdoors are present, but the handling of seed phrases and the hardcoded credentials are serious security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears designed to exfiltrate seed phrases via Telegram, indicating malicious intent or severe security negligence. It leaks sensitive information without safeguards, and hardcoded credentials compound the risk. Overall, the script demonstrates a high security risk, potentially used for malicious data theft.",
