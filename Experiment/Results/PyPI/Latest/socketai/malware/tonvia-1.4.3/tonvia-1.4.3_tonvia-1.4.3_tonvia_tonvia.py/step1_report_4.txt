  "purpose": "The code collects 12 seed phrases from user input and sends them as a message to a specified Telegram chat via bot API.",
  "sources": "User input via input() function capturing seed phrases; hardcoded bot token and chat ID; network request to Telegram API via requests.post()",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending data to Telegram API endpoint; the payload containing seed phrases, which may be sensitive",
  "flows": "User inputs seed phrases -> stored in secret_words -> concatenated into message -> sent via requests.post() to Telegram API endpoint",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded bot token and chat ID; directly sending seed phrases over network without encryption or obfuscation; minimal error handling; use of input() for sensitive data",
  "analysis": "The script prompts the user to enter 12 seed phrases and then sends these seed phrases directly to a Telegram chat via the bot API. The presence of a hardcoded bot token and chat ID indicates persistent credentials stored in the code, which could be exploited if leaked. Sending seed phrases unencrypted over the network is a major security risk, as these are highly sensitive credentials. The code lacks validation beyond the seed phrase count, and there is no attempt to obfuscate or secure the data. The network request directly transmits the seed phrases, which could lead to privacy breaches or theft if misused. Overall, the code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive seed data to a third-party service (Telegram), which indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to intentionally exfiltrate seed phrases to a Telegram account, indicating malicious behavior with a high security risk. It exposes sensitive information through network transmission without protection. The use of hardcoded credentials and direct data transmission suggests malicious intent and significant security concerns.",
