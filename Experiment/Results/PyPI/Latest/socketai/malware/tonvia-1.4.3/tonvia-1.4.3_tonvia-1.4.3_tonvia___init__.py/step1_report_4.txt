{
  "purpose": "The code imports and executes a function named 'a' from a module called 'tonvia'.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .tonvia import a' (importing 'a' from a local module).",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'a()' which could potentially execute code from the imported module.",
  "flows": "Import 'a' from local module 'tonvia' -> execute 'a()' function call.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code simply imports and runs a function. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are present. The module name 'tonvia' is non-standard and might warrant further inspection, but alone it is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a local module and immediately calls the imported function. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no obvious malicious behavior in this snippet. The key concern is the imported function 'a', which could contain malicious code, but this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. The code is minimal, likely part of a larger program.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be a simple import and function call without inherent malicious intent. However, the behavior of 'a' in 'tonvia' cannot be determined here. No suspicious activity or malware indicators are evident in this small snippet.",
