{
  "purpose": "Import and invoke function 'a' from the local module 'tonvia'.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .tonvia import a' and function call 'a()'.",
  "sinks": "Function 'a()' potentially executes code or performs actions based on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import of 'a' from local module -> invocation of 'a()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected in the import or function call syntax; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'a' from a local module named 'tonvia' and then calls this function. Without the implementation of 'a', it is impossible to determine if malicious behavior exists. The structure is straightforward and standard for Python modules. The lack of further context or code within 'a' limits the ability to assess security risks fully.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply imports and executes a function from a local module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activities are evident based solely on this snippet. Further analysis of the 'tonvia' module is necessary for a complete security assessment.",
