  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal and appears benign. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with the primary concern being the trustworthiness of 'tonvia' and its function 'a()'. Without further information about 'a()', the risk remains low but not negligible. The scores and analysis are consistent and justified based on the provided code."
