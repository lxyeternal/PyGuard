  "purpose": "Import and invoke function 'a' from the local module 'tonvia'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'tonvia'.",
  "sinks": "Calling function 'a()' which could execute code within the 'tonvia' module.",
  "flows": "Import 'a' from '.tonvia' -> execute 'a()'.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; straightforward import and function call. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function 'a' from a local module named 'tonvia' and then executes it. There is no indication of malicious behavior within this snippet itself; the risk depends on the contents of 'tonvia'. The import source is local, and the function call is direct, which is common in normal code. Without seeing the module's code, we cannot determine if 'a()' is malicious. The code is minimal and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import and function call. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident in this fragment alone. The security risk is low, assuming the 'tonvia' module is trustworthy.",
