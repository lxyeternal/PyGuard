{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'tonvia' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, and the setup() function parameters for metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no untrusted data processing beyond reading a local file.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content as input; uses this data in package setup. No other data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open('README.md').read() directly without validation or error handling, which is typical but not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration details. The only potential concern is reading 'README.md' without error handling, but this is a common practice and not inherently malicious. No suspicious, backdoor, or malicious code is present. There are no external network connections, data exfiltration, or code execution functionalities. Overall, the script appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical setup tasks with no suspicious behavior.",
