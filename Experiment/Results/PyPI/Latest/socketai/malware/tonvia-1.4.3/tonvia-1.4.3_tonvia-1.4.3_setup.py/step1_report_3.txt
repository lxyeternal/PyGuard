{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'tonvia', including its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the setup() function parameters, including package metadata, dependencies, and the contents of 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input data or perform any sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading the long description from 'README.md' and passing package metadata to the setup() function; no untrusted data flows to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, using setuptools. It reads a README file for the long description and specifies package dependencies and metadata. The URL points to a Telegram link, which is unconventional for a package URL but not inherently malicious. There is no code execution, data processing, or external communications that suggest malicious intent. The code appears benign and typical for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
