  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration using setuptools, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, static package metadata fields, URL string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static metadata assigned to setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a Telegram URL ('https://t.me/pozozal') in the metadata, which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no network activity. The only unusual element is the Telegram URL in the 'url' field, which could be used for social engineering but does not execute or leak data. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0 and a low security risk score (0.1 to 0.2) due to the URL. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior support a conclusion of no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the Telegram URL, which could be used for social engineering but does not affect the code's security. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
