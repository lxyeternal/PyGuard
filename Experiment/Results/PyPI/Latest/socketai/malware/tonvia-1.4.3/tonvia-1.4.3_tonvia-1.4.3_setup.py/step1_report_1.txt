  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for the 'tonvia' Python package including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters such as 'name', 'version', 'packages', 'install_requires', 'description', 'long_description', 'url', 'author', 'author_email', 'classifiers', and 'python_requires'. The 'long_description' reads from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'long_description' reading from 'README.md' could be a source if the file content is malicious, but this is standard and not suspicious by itself.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow detected; data flows from static inputs (parameters and file read) into the setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The URL points to a Telegram link, which could be used for malicious purposes if misused, but in this context, it's just metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It specifies package info, dependencies, and metadata. The 'long_description' reads from an external file, which is common. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors observed. The use of a Telegram URL in metadata is unusual but not inherently malicious. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The inclusion of a Telegram URL is unusual but not suspicious in this context.",
