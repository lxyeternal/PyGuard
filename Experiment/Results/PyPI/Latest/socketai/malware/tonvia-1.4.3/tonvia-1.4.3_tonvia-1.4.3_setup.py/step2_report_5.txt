  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code is a standard setup script, with no suspicious behaviors. Notes the Telegram URL as unusual but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0. Confident in the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Also finds the code standard, with no suspicious code or data flow issues. Mentions reading 'README.md' without validation but considers it typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizes that the code is typical for package setup, with no suspicious behaviors. Mentions the Telegram URL as unconventional but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Recognizes the URL as unusual but not malicious, and confirms the script is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. Slightly higher risk due to the URL, but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the Telegram URL as potentially suspicious but not malicious, and confirms the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Justified. The URL could be used for malicious communication, but the code itself doesn't contain malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, with some reports assigning 0.1 or 0.2 due to the Telegram URL, which is unconventional for package metadata but not inherently malicious.\n\n**Justification for the risk scores:**\n\n- The only suspicious element is the URL (`https://t.me/pozozal`). While it could be used for malicious purposes (e.g., social engineering, command and control, or social links), the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The risk scores of 0.1 or 0.2 are reasonable, reflecting caution but not indicating a high security threat.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- The scores assigned are appropriate given the evidence.\n- No changes needed; the reasoning aligns with the code content.\n- The overall security posture is benign, with only minor concern about the URL.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Final Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware           | **0**               |\n| Obfuscated        | **0**               |\n| Risk              | **0.1 - 0.2**       |\n\nThe package setup code is standard, with no malicious activity detected. The only point of note is the Telegram URL, which warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior on its own.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the scores are justified as-is.",
