  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports describe a single import statement: `from .key import EOSIOKey`. This is a standard relative import in Python, referencing a local module. There are no signs of code execution, data handling, or network activity in these snippets. Based solely on this, there are no issues or vulnerabilities directly observable.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this is a simple import statement with no malicious activity. They correctly note the absence of data flows, anomalies, or suspicious patterns. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk:** All are 0, which aligns with the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince the code is only an import statement, assigning a high risk score would be unjustified. The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities, nor does it handle untrusted data.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware scores are all 0, which is correct. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as hidden code, obfuscated payloads, or suspicious imports.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only describe the code snippet and its straightforward nature.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThis code snippet is a standard import statement with no malicious intent, no data flow, and no anomalies. It’s a typical part of a modular Python project. Without additional context or code, there’s no reason to suspect any security issues.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.",
