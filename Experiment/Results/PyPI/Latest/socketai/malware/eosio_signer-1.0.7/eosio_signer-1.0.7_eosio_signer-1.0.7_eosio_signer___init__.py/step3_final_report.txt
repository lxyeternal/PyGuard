{
  "purpose": "Import a class named EOSIOKey from a local module key, likely for cryptographic or key management purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code fragment; it does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as the code only imports a class without executing any functions or methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement in Python, referencing a local module. It does not perform any runtime actions, data handling, or network operations. The import of EOSIOKey suggests usage in cryptographic or blockchain-related functionality, but on its own, it poses no security risk. The minimal nature of the code and the absence of dynamic or obfuscated elements indicate a benign intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign appropriate scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are justified and appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security concerns based solely on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
