  "purpose": "Import the EOSIOKey class or function from the key module in the current package",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .key module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this line",
  "flows": "N/A - only an import statement with no runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "Simple relative import; no signs of unusual or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement using a relative import syntax to bring in EOSIOKey from the key module within the same package. There are no operations, data handling, or dynamic execution present. No credentials, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observable in this single line. Since this is just an import statement, it cannot be malicious by itself, though the content of the imported module cannot be assessed here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It performs a simple import, and there is no evidence of malware or suspicious behavior in this line.",
