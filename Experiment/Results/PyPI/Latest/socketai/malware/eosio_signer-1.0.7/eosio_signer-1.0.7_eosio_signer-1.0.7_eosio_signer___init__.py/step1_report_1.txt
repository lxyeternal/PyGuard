  "purpose": "Importing the EOSIOKey class from a local key module.",
  "sources": "The code imports a class from a local module file named 'key'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established; just an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a straightforward import statement from a relative module, indicating modular code structure. There are no indications of malicious activity such as data leakage, code injection, or hidden behavior. Since the code is minimal and does not execute any actions, it presents a low security risk. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security concerns. It shows no suspicious or malicious behavior based on this fragment alone.",
