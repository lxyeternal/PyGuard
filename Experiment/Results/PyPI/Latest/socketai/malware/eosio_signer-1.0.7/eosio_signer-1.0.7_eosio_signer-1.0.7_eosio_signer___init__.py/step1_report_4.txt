  "purpose": "Import the EOSIOKey class from a local key module, likely for cryptographic or blockchain key management.",
  "sources": "The source is a local module file '.key' that contains the definition of EOSIOKey.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks in this single line; potential sinks depend on how EOSIOKey is used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present in this line; it only imports a class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior are apparent from this single import statement.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward relative import of a class from a local module. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The import itself is standard practice in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a normal import operation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this line.",
