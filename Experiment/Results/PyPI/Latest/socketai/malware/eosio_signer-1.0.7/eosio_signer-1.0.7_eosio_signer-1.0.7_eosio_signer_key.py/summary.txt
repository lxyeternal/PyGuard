  "conclusion": "The cryptographic functions are standard and not malicious; however, the constructor of EOSIOKey contains embedded malicious behavior—executing system commands and exfiltrating system info to an external server during object creation. This behavior indicates covert data exfiltration, classifying the code as highly malicious. The scores should reflect high confidence in malicious intent, with malware score around 0.9 and security risk near 0.9. The code should be flagged accordingly for containing malicious exfiltration activity."
