{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class initialization with optional private string",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data output or external calls present",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic; method signatures define expected behavior but contain no implementation",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with method signatures for signing, verification, and key conversion, intended for cryptographic use. It contains no implementation details, no data handling, and no external interactions. The only parameter is a default empty string for a private key, which is standard in such abstract definitions. No malicious or suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a template for cryptographic signers and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign and standard abstract class definition.",
