{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class 'Signer' for cryptographic signing operations, specifying required methods for subclasses.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'private_str' in __init__, method arguments 'digest', 'encoded_sig' in sign and verify methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods do not directly write to external sources or untrusted destinations; no data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method inputs ('digest', 'encoded_sig') through the methods; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with an optional constructor parameter 'private_str' which defaults to an empty string. No operations, data processing, or external interactions are present. The class establishes a contract for subclasses to implement cryptographic signing functionalities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns. The code appears standard for a cryptographic interface definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract base class defining a signing interface without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. It poses no security risks by itself.",
