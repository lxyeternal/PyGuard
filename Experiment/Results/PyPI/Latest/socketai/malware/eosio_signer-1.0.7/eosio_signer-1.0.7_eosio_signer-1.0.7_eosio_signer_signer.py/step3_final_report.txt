  "purpose": "Defines an abstract interface for cryptographic signing operations, including methods for public key derivation, WIF format, signing, and verification.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameter 'private_str' (unused), abstract method signatures (to_public, to_wif, sign, verify).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; methods are abstract with no implementation.",
  "flows": "No concrete data flows; intended for subclass implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Unused 'private_str' parameter in constructor; no implementation details or data processing; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward abstract base class with no logic or external interactions. The 'private_str' parameter is accepted but not stored or used, indicating a placeholder or incomplete implementation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to zero. The code's simplicity and lack of data flows or external calls support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard abstract class defining cryptographic signing interfaces. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The unused 'private_str' parameter is a minor design note but does not impact security. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and appropriate.",
