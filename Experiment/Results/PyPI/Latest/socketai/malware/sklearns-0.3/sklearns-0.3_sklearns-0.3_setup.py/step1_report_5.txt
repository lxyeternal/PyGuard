{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs a custom post-installation process.",
  "sources": "The URL constructed in the send() function using platform information and the external IP address fetched via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').",
  "sinks": "Requests made to a webhook URL with data including system hostname, OS, and external IP address, sent via an HTTP GET request.",
  "flows": "After installation, the custom run() method executes send(), which gathers system info and IP address, then sends this data to an external webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function automatically exfiltrates system information (hostname, OS, IP address) to an external server during package installation without user consent or notification.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools for package installation. It defines a custom install command that overrides the run() method to execute send(). The send() function constructs a URL with system-specific data and sends an HTTP request to a remote webhook, effectively exfiltrating system details. The code does not perform any malicious actions like damaging files, unauthorized access, or data theft beyond system info exfiltration. This behavior appears to be intentionally embedded to collect environment data during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious depending on context. The use of requests to send system data to an external URL without user consent is a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a covert data exfiltration mechanism during package installation, which could be malicious if used without user awareness. It is likely intended to spy on or track systems installing the package. No other malicious activities are present, but the privacy violation is significant.",
