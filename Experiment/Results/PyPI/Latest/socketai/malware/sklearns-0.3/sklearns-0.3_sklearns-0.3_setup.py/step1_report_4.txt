{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'sklearns' with a custom post-installation step that sends system and network information to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' for public IP, and to a webhook URL with system hostname, OS info, and IP embedded in the URL.",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed with platform data and IP is used in a GET request to an external server, potentially leaking system info.",
  "flows": "System retrieves IP and hostname, constructs URL with these details, then sends a GET request to the webhook URL containing sensitive system info.",
  "anomalies": "The post-install hook automatically sends system info and IP address to an external URL without user consent or transparency, which is suspicious. Usage of platform info and external requests in setup.py is unusual and potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party libraries, notably 'requests' for HTTP requests. The 'send' function executes during post-install, printing a message and then constructing a URL that includes the system's hostname, OS, and public IP. It then makes a GET request to this URL. The URL embeds system info and IP address, which are sent to an external webhook URL. This behavior is hidden within the setup process, which is uncommon for benign packages. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks related to the package functionality, and the external data exfiltration indicates malicious intent or privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by secretly exfiltrating system and network information during installation, which is indicative of malicious intent and privacy violation. The post-installation network request to an external webhook with system details is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
