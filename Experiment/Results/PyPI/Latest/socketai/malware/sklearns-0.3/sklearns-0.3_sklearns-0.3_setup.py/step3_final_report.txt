{
  "purpose": "The code performs a post-installation action that collects system hostname, OS, and public IP address, then sends this data to an external webhook URL during package installation.",
  "sources": "The 'send()' function reads system information via 'platform.node()', 'platform.system()', and makes an HTTP request to 'https://api.ipify.org' for the public IP.",
  "sinks": "The 'requests.get()' call sends data to an external URL, transmitting potentially sensitive system information without user consent.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system info functions and IP request, then concatenated into a URL which is requested via 'requests.get()' to exfiltrate data.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs network requests during installation without user interaction, exfiltrating system info silently. No obfuscation or legitimate purpose is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'send()' function that gathers hostname, OS, and public IP, then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a remote webhook during the package's installation process. This behavior is unusual and indicates potential privacy invasion or malicious activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, and the network request occurs automatically during setup, which is suspicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.9, security risk similarly high, obfuscation 0) are justified given the data exfiltration. The behavior aligns with malicious or privacy-invasive intent, and the code does not perform any other harmful actions. Overall, this package exhibits high malicious potential due to covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs silent collection and transmission of system information during installation, representing a significant privacy and security risk. The behavior is consistent with malicious activity, warranting high malware and risk scores. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the package should be treated as malicious or highly suspicious.",
