{
  "purpose": "To define and install a Python package named 'sklearns' with a custom post-install step.",
  "sources": "Requests to external URLs (https://api.ipify.org and webhook.site) to gather system IP address, hostname, and system name.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET request sent to a webhook URL containing system information, potentially leaking data.",
  "flows": "Post-install function gathers system data, constructs URL, and sends it via GET request to a remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function transmits system hostname, OS type, and IP address to an external URL without user consent. The URL is dynamically constructed during installation, which is unusual for standard package setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a custom installation command that executes a 'send()' function after installation. The send() function prints a message, retrieves the system's hostname and OS type, fetches the public IP address, and constructs a URL with these data points. It then performs an HTTP GET request to this URL. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system information to an external server, which is suspicious and not typical for legitimate package installation scripts. The purpose appears to be tracking or spying on the user's system, which could be malicious. The use of external requests during installation is a red flag, especially when data is sent without user awareness or consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external webhook during installation. This indicates a potential privacy violation and malicious intent, as it secretly transmits system data to a third party. The package's core functionality seems benign, but the post-install behavior is suspicious and potentially harmful.",
