{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs the 'sklearns' package and executes a post-installation routine.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information using platform.node() and platform.system(), and makes HTTP requests to external URLs via requests.get().",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL with platform info and IP address is used in requests.get(), which sends data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Input data from platform and IP API flows into URL construction, which is then used in requests.get() to send data externally.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a network request during installation, sending system info and IP address to an external webhook without user consent or warning. This behavior is hidden in a post-install hook and is not typical for standard package installation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'send()' that, upon invocation, collects system hostname and OS info, retrieves the public IP address, constructs a URL embedding this data, and sends an HTTP GET request to a specified webhook. The 'PostInstallCommand' class overrides the 'run' method to call 'send()' after the normal installation process. During setup, the custom install command is specified, causing 'send()' to execute post-install. This behavior appears to collect and exfiltrate system information without explicit user consent, which is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially as it occurs during package installation without user awareness.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes hidden data exfiltration behavior during package installation, sending system info and IP address to an external webhook. This constitutes malicious activity and poses a privacy risk.",
