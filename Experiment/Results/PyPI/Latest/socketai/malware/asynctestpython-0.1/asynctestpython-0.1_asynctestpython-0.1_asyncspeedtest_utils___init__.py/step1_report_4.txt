  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific classes from local submodules and defines its public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible; the code only imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The import statements are standard, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module index file that exports specific classes. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears benign.",
