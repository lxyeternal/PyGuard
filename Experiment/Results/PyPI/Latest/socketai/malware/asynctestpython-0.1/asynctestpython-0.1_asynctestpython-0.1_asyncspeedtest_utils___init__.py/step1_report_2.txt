  "purpose": "This code is designed to import and expose specific classes from local modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-critical actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present; the code only imports classes and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules and a list defining public API (__all__). It does not include any dynamic code execution, input handling, network activity, or other typical malicious behaviors. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic present. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, used to expose modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module initializer with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions to re-export specific classes for external use without performing any operations that could be malicious.",
