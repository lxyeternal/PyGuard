{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports several classes and exposes them for external use, likely part of a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sinks are present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow, no untrusted source-to-sink path",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated content; the code structure is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple classes from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The import statements are standard and do not involve dynamic execution or obfuscated code. Since no runtime logic, data processing, or network operations are present, this code by itself poses no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple module interface, exposing classes for use elsewhere. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies within this snippet.",
