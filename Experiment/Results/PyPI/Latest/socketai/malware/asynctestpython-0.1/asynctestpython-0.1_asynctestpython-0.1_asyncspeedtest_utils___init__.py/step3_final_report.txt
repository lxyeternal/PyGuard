  "purpose": "Module initializer re-exporting classes from local submodules for public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static imports and export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward module index file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, no data processing, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module re-export file with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
