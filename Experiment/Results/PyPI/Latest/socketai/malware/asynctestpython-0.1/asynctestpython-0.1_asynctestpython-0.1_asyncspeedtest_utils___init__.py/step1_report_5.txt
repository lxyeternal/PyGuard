{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module initializer that imports specific classes from other modules and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: autostart, message, loader, protector, grabber.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing; no external data or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink pathways; purely import and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports classes from relative modules and sets an __all__ attribute for exports. It contains no logic, data processing, or external interactions. The lack of functions, data handling, or network operations suggests it is a standard module index file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initializer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports components for external use.",
