  "purpose": "This code module re-exports several classes from local submodules for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.autostart, .message, .loader, .protector, .grabber).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only performs import and export operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and defines an __all__ list for exports. No input/output handling, network activity, or data processing is present. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The simplicity and standard structure suggest a standard package module setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module re-export file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
