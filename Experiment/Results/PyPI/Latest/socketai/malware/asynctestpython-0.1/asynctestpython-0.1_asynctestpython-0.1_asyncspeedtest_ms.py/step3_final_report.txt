{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for covert data collection and exfiltration, including system info, browser data, and application details, transmitted via Telegram.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded Telegram token and user ID; environment variables; command-line arguments; imported modules; SSL context override.",
  "sinks": "Data sent through Telegram API; files stored in zip archives; potential network connections.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system modules, packaged, and transmitted via the Telegram sender; exceptions suppressed to hide errors.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded Telegram credentials; SSL verification disabled; broad silent exception handling; extensive data collection scope.",
  "analysis": "The code performs broad data collection including passwords, cookies, wallets, and system info. It uses hardcoded credentials and disables SSL verification, which are significant security flaws. Silent exception handling can conceal malicious activity. The pattern aligns with malware designed for covert surveillance and data theft.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, primarily due to embedded credentials, insecure communication, and extensive data exfiltration. It should be classified as malicious with high security risk.",
