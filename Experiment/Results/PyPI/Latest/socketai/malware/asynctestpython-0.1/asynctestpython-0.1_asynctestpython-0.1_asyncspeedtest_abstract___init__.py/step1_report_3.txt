  "purpose": "The code exports the AbstractSender class from the sender module, likely to be used as part of a larger package or framework.",
  "sources": "The code imports the AbstractSender class from a local sender module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or sensitive data within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only defining __all__ for module exports; no suspicious or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import and exports a class name for module interface purposes. There are no data input, processing, or output operations that could indicate malicious activity. The minimal structure reduces the likelihood of hidden malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, serving solely to re-export a class for modular use. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
