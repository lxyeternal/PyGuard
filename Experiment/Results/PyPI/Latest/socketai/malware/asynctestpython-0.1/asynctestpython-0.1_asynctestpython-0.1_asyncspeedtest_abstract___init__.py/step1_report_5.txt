  "purpose": "Defines an interface or abstract class for a sender component, likely part of a larger module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from a relative module '.sender'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code only declares an import and an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; very minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an abstract sender class from a local module and specifies it as the public API. No execution or data processing occurs here. The code is simple, standard, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger codebase providing an abstract sender interface.",
