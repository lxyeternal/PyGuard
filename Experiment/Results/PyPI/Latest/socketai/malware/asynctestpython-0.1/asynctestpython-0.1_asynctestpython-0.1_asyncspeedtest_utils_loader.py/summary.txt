  "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but poses a high security risk due to its ability to download and execute arbitrary files without validation, especially with the use of shell=True and silent error handling. It can be exploited for malicious purposes if misused, justifying a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score around 0.85. Proper validation, sanitization, and error reporting are essential to mitigate these risks."
