  "purpose": "Display a fake error message window using Windows API, sourced from external configuration.",
  "sources": "Message content and title from MessageConfig; user32 MessageBoxW API call.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data processing beyond UI display.",
  "flows": "MessageConfig provides text → windll.user32.MessageBoxW displays message.",
  "anomalies": "Silent exception handling (try-except pass), but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly creates a Windows message box with content from MessageConfig. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. Exception handling silently ignores errors, which could hide bugs but is not malicious. The use of Windows API for UI display is common and benign. External MessageConfig could contain malicious text, but this is outside the code's scope. Overall, the code appears as a simple utility for UI deception, with no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain malware or obfuscation. Its primary concern is potential social engineering via fake error messages, but technically, it is safe. Scores reflect minimal security risk.",
