{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various classes and enums for use in a larger application or library, likely related to processing or security functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.ms, .enums, .utils) and the __all__ declaration defining exposed components.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code itself does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are present; the code only sets up imports and exports for other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language constructs, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward, typical of Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module initializer that imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and defines the public API via __all__. There are no dynamic code executions, data manipulations, or network operations. The imported modules (.ms, .enums, .utils) could potentially contain malicious code, but within this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code serves as an interface or organizational structure.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard module setup for organizing and exposing internal components. There are no signs of malware or security risks within this snippet. It appears to be benign and typical of Python package initializations.",
