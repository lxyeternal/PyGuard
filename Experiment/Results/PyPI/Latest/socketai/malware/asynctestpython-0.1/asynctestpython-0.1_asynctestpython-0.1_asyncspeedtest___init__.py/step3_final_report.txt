  "purpose": "Module initializer importing classes and enums from internal modules and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Internal modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; potential risks depend on contents of imported modules",
  "flows": "Static imports from internal modules; no untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup that imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and defines __all__ for export. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The code structure is standard, and no obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The security concern depends on the contents of the imported modules, but within this snippet, no malicious activity is evident. The assigned scores in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The scores and reasoning in the reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
