{
  "purpose": "This code is primarily responsible for importing specific classes and enums from local modules and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules (.ms, .enums, .utils) and the __all__ list definition.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the import process itself, which could lead to execution of imported code, but in this context, it appears standard.",
  "flows": "Imports are static, so data flows are limited to module loading and namespace initialization; no untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code structure is simple and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It does not include any dynamic execution, user input handling, or network operations. The imported modules could be checked further, but based on this snippet alone, there are no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module initialization code with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
