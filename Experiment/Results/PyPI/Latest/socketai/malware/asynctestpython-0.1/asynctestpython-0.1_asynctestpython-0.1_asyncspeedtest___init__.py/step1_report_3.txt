{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports classes and enums from internal submodules for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ms, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imports data from internal modules, exposing them via __all__ for external use",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, no hidden backdoors or malicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration to define public API. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious behavior, or suspicious logic. The modules imported are likely internal utility classes and enums, typical in structured Python projects. No external data sources or sinks are involved here, and no unusual patterns or code anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module initializer with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports and exposes certain components for use in other parts of the project.",
