  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging 'asynctestpython'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, environment variables, or user inputs; only static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of setuptools with no obfuscation or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools, then calls setup() with basic package information. It performs no dynamic operations, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. The use of find_packages() is standard and safe unless misconfigured, which is not indicated here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
