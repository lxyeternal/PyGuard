{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for a Python package named 'asynctestpython' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The setup() function and find_packages() call that read package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data or user input could be processed or affect system behavior.",
  "flows": "The setup() function gathers package metadata and finds packages to include, with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or behavior; standard setup script for packaging Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools functions, then calls setup() with package name and version, and uses find_packages() to discover packages. There are no dynamic imports, user input processing, or network operations. The code strictly performs package configuration, which is typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
