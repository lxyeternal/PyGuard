  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'asynctestpython'.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only imports from setuptools to define package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external communications or data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code solely defines package metadata and structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup configuration without hidden or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' and 'find_packages' from setuptools to facilitate package creation. It defines package name and version, and uses find_packages() to include all packages in the directory. The code is minimal, typical for Python packaging, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or secret handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious features. It is safe and purely for packaging purposes.",
