  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python project named 'asynctestpython'.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function and 'find_packages()' which determine package metadata and included modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code only defines package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with a name, version, and finds packages to include. This is standard packaging code. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. No code execution or data handling occurs beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
