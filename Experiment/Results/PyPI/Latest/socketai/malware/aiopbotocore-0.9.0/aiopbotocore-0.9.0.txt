      "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation. The existing reports mostly recognize this, but some underestimate the severity. The malware score should be increased to approximately 0.85-0.9, and the security risk should be around 0.85, reflecting high suspicion of malicious intent and significant security threat."
