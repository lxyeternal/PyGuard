{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom post-installation script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the platform node name, system info, and external IP via requests.get calls during the send() function.",
  "sinks": "The constructed URL is sent via a GET request which includes sensitive system information in the URL query parameters.",
  "flows": "The send() function gathers system info and IP, constructs a URL, then sends a GET request to an external webhook, exposing system data.",
  "anomalies": "The send() function runs automatically after installation, sending system info to an external URL without user consent or notification. The URL is hardcoded, and the requests library is used for network activity during install.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and defines a custom install command that, upon execution, calls a function 'send()'. This function prints a message, then constructs a URL containing the machine's node name, OS info, and current IP address retrieved via requests. It then performs an HTTP GET request to that URL, transmitting system data to an external server without user awareness. The setup configuration includes this custom command, meaning the data exfiltration occurs during package installation. No other malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident, but the automatic sending of system information to an external webhook indicates malicious intent or privacy invasion.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes a covert data exfiltration mechanism that sends system information to an external server during installation. It violates user privacy and security best practices, indicating malicious behavior. The code does not appear obfuscated but performs unauthorized data collection silently.",
