{
  "purpose": "The code performs a covert data exfiltration during package installation by sending system hostname, OS info, and external IP to an external webhook URL.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), platform.system(), requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')",
  "sinks": "requests.get(url) to send data to external webhook",
  "flows": "source data (hostname, OS, IP) collected and sent via GET request to the webhook URL during install",
  "anomalies": "Data exfiltration during installation without user consent; no obfuscation; straightforward code; sending data to a suspicious URL",
  "analysis": "The code defines a setup script with a custom install command that, after installation, executes 'send()'. This function collects system info and external IP, constructs a URL embedding this data, and sends it via a GET request to a webhook URL. The behavior is covert and resembles malicious data exfiltration or surveillance. Multiple reports correctly identify this activity, with scores reflecting high suspicion. The malware scores range from 0.5 to 0.9, with the highest justified by explicit exfiltration. The risk scores are similarly high, indicating serious privacy and security concerns. The code's straightforward nature and lack of obfuscation support a high malware and risk assessment. Given the behavior, the overall conclusion is that the code is malicious, performing covert data theft during supply chain installation, warranting a malware score around 0.8-0.9 and a security risk near 0.85.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior through covert data exfiltration during package installation. The existing reports mostly recognize this, but some underestimate the severity. The malware score should be increased to approximately 0.85-0.9, and the security risk should be around 0.85, reflecting high suspicion of malicious intent and significant security threat.",
