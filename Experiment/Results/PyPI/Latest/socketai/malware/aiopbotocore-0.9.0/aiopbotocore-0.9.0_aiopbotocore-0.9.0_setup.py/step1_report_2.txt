{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and executes a post-install action.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment data via platform.node() and platform.system(), and fetches the public IP address using requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').",
  "sinks": "The URL constructed with the collected data is used in a requests.get() call, sending data to an external webhook URL.",
  "flows": "After installation, the send() function is invoked, which collects system hostname, OS info, and public IP, then constructs a URL and makes a GET request to that URL, sending potentially sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unsolicited network request to an external webhook with system information, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The use of requests within setup scripts for data exfiltration is suspicious. No user input validation or explicit consent is observed.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define a package and overrides the install command to include a post-install action. The send() function is called during installation, which gathers hostname, OS info, and public IP, then sends this data via a GET request to an external URL (webhook). This behavior resembles data exfiltration, which is malicious in intent. No credentials or secrets are hardcoded; however, the action itself (sending system info to an external server) is suspicious and likely malicious, potentially serving as a backdoor or surveillance mechanism. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are used. The use of a publicly accessible webhook URL with embedded identifier suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating system information to an external webhook during package installation. It appears designed for surveillance or data theft without user consent, indicating a supply chain security threat. The overall security risk is high.",
