{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package installation process with a custom post-install step that sends system information to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Requests to 'https://api.ipify.org' to obtain public IP address, platform.node() and platform.system() to obtain system info, and the constructed URL to send data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to the constructed URL which includes system data, potentially exfiltrating system information without user consent.",
  "flows": "The system's hostname and OS info are fetched, combined with the IP address, and sent via a GET request to an external URL during package installation.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs data exfiltration during installation without user knowledge or consent, which is unusual behavior for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a 'send' function that collects system information and sends it to a remote webhook URL. The custom install command triggers this function after installation. The setup configuration includes this custom command, ensuring the data exfiltration occurs during package installation. The use of 'requests' for network communication and the collection of host-specific data indicate malicious intent for spying or tracking purposes. No other suspicious code or obfuscation is present. The behavior is consistent with a malicious supply chain attack aimed at covertly gathering system details.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to exfiltrate system information during package installation without user consent, which constitutes a supply chain security risk. This code should be considered highly suspicious and potentially malicious.",
