{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup process with a custom post-installation step that sends system information to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads platform node and system information via platform.node() and platform.system(), and obtains the external IP address through a GET request to 'https://api.ipify.org'.",
  "sinks": "The data (system node, system name, and IP address) is embedded into a URL and then a GET request is made to that URL, potentially transmitting sensitive system information to an external server.",
  "flows": "Source: platform.node(), platform.system(), and requests.get('https://api.ipify.org') -> Data concatenation into URL -> requests.get(url) as the sink where data is sent to external server.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'send()' is called automatically during installation, sending system info without user consent or notification. The URL used ('https://webhook.site/...') indicates data exfiltration or testing. The code includes an external request during install that could be used maliciously to harvest system info.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script but includes a custom post-install step 'send()' that gathers system info and IP address, then transmits this data via a GET request to a specific URL. This behavior occurs during package installation, which can be considered malicious as it secretly exfiltrates system information. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present, but the behavior of sending system data without user knowledge is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes. The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscation or complex dynamic code. The external URL suggests that this might be used for testing or malicious data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious-like behavior of secretly sending system information during installation, which is a security concern. While it doesn't contain obfuscation or malware per se, the data exfiltration behavior makes it risky for supply chain security. It should be scrutinized further before use.",
