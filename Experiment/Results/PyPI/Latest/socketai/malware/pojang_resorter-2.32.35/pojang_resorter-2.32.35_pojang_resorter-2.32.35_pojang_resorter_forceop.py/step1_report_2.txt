  "purpose": "This script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: username, server_ip, rcon_port, rcon_password from command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "The MCRcon command execution ('op' command) that modifies server privileges.",
  "flows": "User input flows into the assign_operator function, which then executes the 'op' command through MCRcon, potentially affecting server state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious command injection, and no hidden behaviors. Use of logging and exception handling appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code securely accepts user input via command-line arguments, and uses a well-known library (mcrcon) to send an 'op' command to a Minecraft server. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; the RCON password is provided at runtime. The code does not perform any network requests outside the intended server command, nor does it contain obfuscated or malicious code. Logging and exception handling are standard practices. Overall, the script performs a legitimate function without evident malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to assign operator privileges on a Minecraft server. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present.",
