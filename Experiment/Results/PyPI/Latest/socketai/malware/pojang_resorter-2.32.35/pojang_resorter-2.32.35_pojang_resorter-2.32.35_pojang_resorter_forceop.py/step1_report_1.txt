  "purpose": "This script assigns operator privileges to a specified user on a Minecraft server via RCON protocol.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for username, server IP, RCON port, and RCON password; logs connection attempts and responses.",
  "targets": "Uses RCON command to execute 'op' for a user, which can modify server operator status.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs → RCON connection → 'op' command → server response",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. Logging is standard. No indications of malicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly uses argparse for input collection, logs the process, and executes a command to grant operator privileges through RCON. It handles exceptions gracefully. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs a straightforward administrative task without any malicious payload or data exfiltration logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate administrative script for managing Minecraft server operator privileges. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks based on this code alone.",
