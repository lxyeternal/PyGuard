  "purpose": "Assign operator privileges to a user on a Minecraft server via RCON.",
  "sources": "User inputs for username, server IP, RCON port, and RCON password.",
  "sinks": "The command string 'op {username}' sent over RCON; potential exposure of credentials via command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from command-line arguments to the RCON command execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of inputs; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an RCON connection to a Minecraft server and executes the 'op' command for a specified user. It uses user-provided inputs directly in the command, which is standard for such utilities. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The script includes logging and exception handling, with credentials supplied at runtime, which is typical but should be protected. The risk primarily involves credential exposure if logs or process lists are compromised, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate administrative utility for managing Minecraft server operator privileges. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, mainly related to credential handling via command-line arguments. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
