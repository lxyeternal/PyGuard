  "purpose": "This script provides a static command-line help interface with ASCII art and colored headers, displaying available commands.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via argparse; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or output; no sinks for data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed but do not influence any dynamic or external operations; the flow is static display.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and uses standard libraries without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, initializes colorama, and defines a function to print ASCII art and command descriptions. It only outputs static content without external interactions or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. All command options are purely for help display. The code's behavior is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI help utility with ASCII art and command descriptions. It does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with no need for adjustments.",
