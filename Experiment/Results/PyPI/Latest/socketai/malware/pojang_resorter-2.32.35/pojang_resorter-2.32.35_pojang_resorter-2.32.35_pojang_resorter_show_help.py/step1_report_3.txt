{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface (CLI) with colored ASCII art, help message, and subcommands for a Python-based tool related to Mojang interactions.",
  "sources": "argparse module (reads command-line arguments), colorama module (initializes and applies colors).",
  "sinks": "Printing ASCII art and help messages to console; no data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments flow from argparse input to command execution, but no untrusted data is processed or passed to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Usage of colorama and ASCII art appears purely for visual enhancement; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and colorama for terminal coloring, then defines a function to display help with ASCII art and color styling. It sets up argparse with subcommands and prints the ASCII art header along with command options. The script only outputs to the console and does not perform any network, file, or environment modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The code structure is straightforward and intended for user interaction only.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign CLI utility focused on user interface presentation and command documentation. No malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks are present.",
