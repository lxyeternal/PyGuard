{
  "purpose": "Provide a CLI help interface with ASCII art and command descriptions for a Python-Mojang interaction tool.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via argparse to determine user commands.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; output is to terminal, no untrusted data output or external network connections.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments influences which help messages are displayed; no data flows to other parts or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures; ASCII art is purely decorative. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes colorama for colored terminal output, defines a help display function that prints ASCII art and command options, and calls this function in the main block. All commands are static, with no user input beyond command-line args. No external data or network activity is performed. The code is straightforward and designed solely for user guidance, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI help display script with ASCII art and command descriptions. It does not contain malware or security risks. The script is safe and contains no malicious behavior.",
