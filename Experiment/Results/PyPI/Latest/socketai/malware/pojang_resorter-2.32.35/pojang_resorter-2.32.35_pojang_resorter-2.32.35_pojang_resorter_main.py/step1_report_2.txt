{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface to execute various server-related commands by invoking corresponding scripts or functions, primarily for server initialization, snapshot, help display, operator assignment, or server shutdown.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments ('command' and 'extra_args') and dynamically imports modules or executes scripts based on these inputs.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess.run call executes external Python scripts, and dynamic imports can execute code from specified modules. Inputs can influence which scripts or functions are called.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line arguments) -> command mapping (deciding which script or function to run) -> subprocess execution or function invocation.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically runs other scripts based on user input without strict validation, which could lead to execution of unintended scripts if command_map is manipulated. Also, the code imports modules dynamically based on fixed command strings but does not sanitize the arguments further. No hardcoded credentials are visible. The subprocess call is used safely for executing scripts, but it depends on the user-provided command mapping.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up logging and reads command-line arguments. It maps commands to specific script files or functions, invoking them via subprocess or direct imports. The 'assign_operator' command imports a function from 'pojang_resorter.forceop', and 'nukeserver' invokes a function from 'pojang_resorter.nukeserver'. These modules are external, but their code is not provided, so their security cannot be assessed here. The code allows execution of arbitrary scripts within the directory based on command mapping, but the mapping is predefined and does not directly accept arbitrary user input for script names. The only user input that could influence code execution is the command argument, which is limited to specific choices. No indication of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks is observed in this snippet. The dynamic invocation is controlled through a predefined command_map, reducing risk of arbitrary code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a controlled command dispatcher that executes specific scripts or functions based on user input. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are detected. Its design limits execution to predefined commands, minimizing attack surface. The overall security risk is low.",
