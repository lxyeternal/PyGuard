{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface to execute predefined scripts or internal functions based on user input, primarily for server management tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments ('command' and 'extra_args') via argparse; uses command map to determine script or function to invoke.",
  "sinks": "Executes scripts via subprocess.run(['python', script_path]); imports and calls functions from external modules ('pojang_resorter.forceop', 'pojang_resorter.nukeserver').",
  "flows": "User inputs command -> command mapped via command_map -> either subprocess executes a script or internal function is called through dynamic import.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; limited command choices reduce risk; dynamic imports are controlled but depend on external modules' integrity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a controlled CLI wrapper that executes specific scripts or functions based on predefined commands. It uses subprocess to run scripts and dynamic imports for internal functions, both of which are limited to a fixed set of commands, reducing arbitrary execution risks. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. External modules ('forceop', 'nukeserver') could pose risks if compromised, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic. The command choices and import paths are explicit, minimizing attack surface. The main concern is external dependency trustworthiness, not code maliciousness. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting external dependency risk but no inherent malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, controlled CLI wrapper executing predefined scripts and functions. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is found. The main security consideration is external module trustworthiness. Overall, the code is safe within its context, with a low to moderate security risk primarily due to external dependencies.",
