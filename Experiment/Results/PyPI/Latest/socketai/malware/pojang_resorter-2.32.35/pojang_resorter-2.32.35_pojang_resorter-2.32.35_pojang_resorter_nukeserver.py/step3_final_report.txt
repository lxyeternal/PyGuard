  "purpose": "Launcher script that locates and executes an external Windows executable ('libs/windows.exe') without validation.",

  "sinks": "subprocess.run([exe_path])",
  "flows": "Construct path -> check existence -> execute executable",
  "anomalies": "No validation or signature verification of 'windows.exe'; no obfuscation or hidden code",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to 'libs/windows.exe' relative to its directory, checks for its existence, and executes it via subprocess.run. It logs actions and handles exceptions but does not validate the executable's integrity or content. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. The primary security concern is executing an unverified external binary, which could be malicious if compromised. The script itself is straightforward and benign, acting as a launcher.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple external executable launcher with no malicious code or obfuscation. The main risk is trusting the external binary ('windows.exe'), which could be malicious if compromised. The code itself is safe, but executing unverified binaries carries inherent risk. Therefore, the malware score should be 0, obfuscation 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.3) due to external execution without validation.",
