{
  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the Pojang Resorter CLI package and imports the main module to be used as the entry point.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata (__version__, __author__) and imports from the local module .main.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data flows into or out of the code that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets metadata and imports a module.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal, straightforward, and typical for a Python package's __init__.py. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata and imports the main function from a local module. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are involved. The import of .main could potentially execute code if that module contains malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is evident. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization file with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely sets metadata and imports a main module. The security posture depends on the contents of the imported module, which is not provided.",
