  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package init file with no input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The import of .main could pose a risk if that module contains malicious code, but this cannot be determined from the snippet. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of this minimal code, considering the potential risk from the imported module. Confidence is high that the code itself is safe; the main concern is the content of .main, which is unknown.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical for a package __init__.py. The scores are appropriate, with a slight caution due to the import of .main, which could contain malicious code. Overall, no malicious activity or obfuscation is detected in this snippet.",
