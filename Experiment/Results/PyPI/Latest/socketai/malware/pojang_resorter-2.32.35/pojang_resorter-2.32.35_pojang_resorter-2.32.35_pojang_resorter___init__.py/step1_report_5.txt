  "purpose": "Provides metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "N/A – only metadata and import, no data flow",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns; straightforward package metadata",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package __init__.py file with descriptive comments, versioning, author info, and an import statement for the main function. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute any suspicious actions. The import suggests the main functionality resides elsewhere, but this file itself is benign. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely sets up the package metadata and imports the main module. No suspicious behavior detected.",
