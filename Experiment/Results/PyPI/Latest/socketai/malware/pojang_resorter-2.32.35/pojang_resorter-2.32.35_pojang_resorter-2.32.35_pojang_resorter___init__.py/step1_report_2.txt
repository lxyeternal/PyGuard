  "sources": "Importing 'main' from the same package; defining __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines module metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package module that imports a main function and defines metadata variables. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no input handling, no network activity, or potentially harmful constructs. The code structure is simple and typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a minimal module setup with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
