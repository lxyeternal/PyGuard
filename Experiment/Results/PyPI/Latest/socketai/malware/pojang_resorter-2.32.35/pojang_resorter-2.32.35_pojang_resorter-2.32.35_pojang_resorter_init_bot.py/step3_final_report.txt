{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated script executing hidden/malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded, reversed string; dynamic import of 'zlib' and 'base64'.",
  "sinks": "exec() of decompressed payload.",
  "flows": "Reverse string -> base64 decode -> decompress -> execute.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, no comments, reliance on dynamic imports and exec().",
  "analysis": "The code employs multiple layers of obfuscation: reversing a large base64 string, decoding, decompressing with zlib, and executing via exec(). The pattern is characteristic of malicious payload loaders or malware obfuscation techniques. The use of dynamic imports and exec() on decompressed data indicates arbitrary code execution, a common trait in malicious scripts. The obfuscation tactics conceal the payload's intent, and the code's structure aligns with known malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is almost certainly malicious, heavily obfuscated to conceal its payload, and poses a high security risk due to its potential for arbitrary code execution.",
