{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated payload intended to execute compressed and encoded code after deobfuscation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from hardcoded byte strings that are base64-encoded and reversed, then decompresses them using zlib.",
  "sinks": "The execution of the decompressed code via exec() function, which can run arbitrary code dynamically.",
  "flows": "The code base64-decodes and reverses the byte string to obtain compressed data, decompresses it, and then executes the resulting code with exec().",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated with base64 encoding, string reversal, and dynamic import of modules within a lambda. The use of exec() on dynamically decompressed code is suspicious. No explicit hardcoded credentials, but the obfuscation suggests malicious intent or payload delivery.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a lambda function that imports 'zlib' and 'base64', decodes a base64-encoded string, reverses it, and decompresses the result. The decompressing step outputs code that is executed directly via exec(). This pattern is commonly used to hide malicious payloads, such as malware or backdoors, by obfuscating the payload. The code does not include any apparent benign functionality and is structured specifically to conceal its true intent. Given the use of exec() on decompressed code, this is a strong indicator of malicious intent, potentially loading and executing arbitrary code. The complexity and obfuscation suggest an attempt to evade static detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and designed to execute dynamically loaded code, which is a typical pattern for malware or malicious payloads. It does not perform any meaningful benign operation. The use of dynamic import, decoding, and execution points toward malicious behavior with a high likelihood of executing arbitrary, potentially harmful code.",
