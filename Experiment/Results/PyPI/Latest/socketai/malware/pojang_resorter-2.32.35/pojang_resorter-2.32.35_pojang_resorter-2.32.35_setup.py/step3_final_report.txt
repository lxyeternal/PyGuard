{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines package metadata, dependencies, and data for distribution. It aims to facilitate installation and setup of the 'pojang_resorter' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the setup() configuration, including package dependencies, package data, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially originate from dependencies or included files, but in this static setup, no runtime sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration flows from dependency declarations and package data inclusion to the installation process, with no dynamic data flow or external input at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "A missing comma after 'mcron' in 'install_requires' causes 'mcronrequests' to be interpreted as a single package name, leading to a syntax error. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with a syntax error due to a missing comma, which could cause installation issues. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code is present. The inclusion of 'libs/windows.exe' is typical for bundled executables but warrants verification. All reports correctly identify the syntax mistake and assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.2). The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward nature of the code and the absence of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign with a minor syntax error that should be corrected for proper installation. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The main concern is fixing the missing comma to prevent build issues.",
