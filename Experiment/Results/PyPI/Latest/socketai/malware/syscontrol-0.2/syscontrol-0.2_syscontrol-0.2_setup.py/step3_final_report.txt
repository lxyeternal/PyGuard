  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for the 'syscontrol' Python library, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static code with no dynamic input, environment variables, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed parameters, representing a typical setup.py script. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices justify these scores. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is a benign, standard package configuration script with no malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
