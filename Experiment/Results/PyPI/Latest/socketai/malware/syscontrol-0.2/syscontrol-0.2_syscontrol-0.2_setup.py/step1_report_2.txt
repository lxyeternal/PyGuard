  "purpose": "To define the package configuration for distributing the 'syscontrol' Python library.",
  "sources": "Standard input data from setup.py file; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the script only calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard setup.py structure without suspicious code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with predefined static parameters such as package name, version, description, author, classifiers, and Python version requirements. The code is straightforward, typical of a setup script, and contains no dynamic code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears to be a standard configuration file for packaging a Python library without any malicious intent or security risks.",
