{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to configure and package the Python library 'syscontrol' for distribution via package managers like PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata such as name, version, description, author, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing occurs in this script; it only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving user input or untrusted sources; the script purely specifies static configuration for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code segments are present. The script follows standard setup.py conventions without obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration using setuptools to define package metadata. It does not perform any runtime data processing, network communication, or contain any code execution beyond the standard packaging instructions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. It adheres to common packaging patterns with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a benign, standard configuration script for packaging a Python library. There is no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code.",
