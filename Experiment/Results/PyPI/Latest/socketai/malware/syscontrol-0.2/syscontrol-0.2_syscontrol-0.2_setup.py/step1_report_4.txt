  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the 'syscontrol' Python library.",
  "sources": "Standard setuptools functions such as find_packages() and package parameters like name, version, description, author, classifiers, and python_requires.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sources or output sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package build process with static metadata; no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code strictly conforms to standard setup.py patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities from setuptools, uses find_packages() to include all packages, and defines package metadata such as name, version, description, author, and classifiers. All elements are standard and follow common setup.py conventions. No code injection, dynamic code execution, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears solely to configure package installation parameters.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is a typical configuration file for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply declares package metadata and setup parameters without any suspicious or malicious code.",
