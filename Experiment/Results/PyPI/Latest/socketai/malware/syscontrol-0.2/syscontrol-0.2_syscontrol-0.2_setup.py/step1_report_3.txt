  "sources": "No explicit data sources; standard setup.py attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only declares package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools to package a Python library. It includes only standard attributes such as name, version, packages, description, author, classifiers, and python_requires. There are no dynamic code executions, network communications, or data handling beyond package metadata declaration. No anomalies or signs of malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears benign and solely serves to configure package installation. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
