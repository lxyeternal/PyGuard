      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the obfuscated code within the 'status()' method, which decodes and executes code dynamically. This pattern strongly indicates potential malicious behavior or backdoors. While the rest of the code appears benign, the embedded obfuscated segment elevates the overall security risk significantly. Further static analysis of the decoded payload is recommended before deployment or trust. The scores assigned are appropriate and reflect the high suspicion level due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution."
