  "confidence": 1,
  "conclusion": "The code contains a severe security flaw: unconditional remote code fetch and execution during decryption, which can lead to arbitrary code execution and system compromise. The obfuscation layer is superficial. The behavior aligns with malicious or backdoor code, warranting a malware score of 1 and a security risk score of 1. The overall assessment confirms high malicious potential, and the code should be treated as malicious or extremely high risk."
