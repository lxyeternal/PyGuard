  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific comments or documentation, its precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include user input, environment variables, or external data files (if any are present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication, file writing, or database access points where data may be transmitted or stored.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network calls or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected. No evident backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious intent. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard Python constructs. No signs of code injection, malicious network activity, or privacy leaks. All functions and variables are used in typical ways. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns identified. The overall structure and logic are consistent with legitimate utility code. Without external context or hidden code, it is not possible to identify malicious intent from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not show any signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation. No security risks are evident, and the code is likely safe to use.",
