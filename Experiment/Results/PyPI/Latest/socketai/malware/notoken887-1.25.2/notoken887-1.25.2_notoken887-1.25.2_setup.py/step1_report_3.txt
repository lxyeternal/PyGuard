  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887'.",
  "sources": "Static data provided within the setup() call, including package name, author info, description, URL, classifiers, and Python version requirement.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output handling present; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration with no dynamic data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an offensive author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') which could be malicious or intended to mislead. No obfuscation or hidden code, but suspicious metadata. No code execution, backdoors, or malicious logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It contains only static data definitions with no dynamic or executable code beyond the setuptools setup function. The author email and URL are unusual and potentially malicious or provocative, but there is no actual malicious code, malware, or obfuscated logic present. The package appears to be for testing obfuscation, as per description, but this does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the script is simple and safe from execution or malicious activity, aside from the suspicious contact info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic setup configuration for a Python package with suspicious contact details but no malicious behavior or malware. No security risks detected beyond potential reputation concerns due to the chosen email and URL.",
