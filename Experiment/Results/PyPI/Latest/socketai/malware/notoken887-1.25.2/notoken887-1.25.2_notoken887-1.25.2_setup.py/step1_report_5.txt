{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static data in setup() parameters such as name, version, author, description, url, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic or untrusted data handling; no sinks that process external input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A - all data is statically defined; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious email 'hitler@gmail.com' and URL 'https://thugging.org' which may be considered unprofessional or maliciously provocative; no code obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py configuration for a Python package. It contains static metadata without any dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing. The email address and URL are unusual and could suggest malicious intent or at least unprofessional behavior, but they do not pose a direct security risk. No signs of malware, code injection, or malicious behavior are present in the script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup configuration with questionable contact details and URL but no malicious code or security risks. No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary concern is the unprofessional or provocative contact information rather than technical security issues.",
