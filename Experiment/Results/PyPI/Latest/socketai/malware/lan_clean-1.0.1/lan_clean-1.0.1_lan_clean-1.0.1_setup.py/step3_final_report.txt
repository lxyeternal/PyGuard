  "purpose": "The code loads a ZIP archive ('my.zip') during setup, creates a module from it, and executes 'my.hello()' without validation.",
  "sources": "Reading 'my.zip' via zipimport, creating module spec, executing 'my.hello()'",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'my.hello()' from the external ZIP module",
  "flows": "zipimporter loads 'my.zip' -> importlib.util creates module spec -> module executes 'hello()'",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic loading and execution of external code during installation without validation",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads 'my.zip' during setup and executes 'hello()' from it without any validation or security checks. This behavior introduces a high security risk, as malicious payloads could be executed. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The risk stems solely from executing untrusted external code at install time, which could be exploited if 'my.zip' is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes external code during installation without validation, posing a significant security risk. While not inherently malicious, this pattern can be exploited to run malicious payloads, warranting a high malware and security risk score.",
