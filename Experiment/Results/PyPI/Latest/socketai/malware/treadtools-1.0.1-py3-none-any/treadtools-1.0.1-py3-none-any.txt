      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware but exhibits unsafe practices such as executing scripts without validation and using deprecated functions. The risk stems from these unsafe practices, which could be exploited in untrusted environments. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.6). The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code demonstrates significant obfuscation and dynamic evaluation, which are red flags for potential malicious intent. Although no definitive malicious actions are confirmed through static analysis, the suspicion level is high, especially in reports with layered encoding and encrypted segments. The scores assigned are consistent with the evidence, with the highest concern for heavily obfuscated and encrypted code (score 1 for malware and obfuscation, risk 1), and lower scores for clearer, legitimate code. Overall, the threat level warrants cautious handling, and further dynamic or de-obfuscation analysis is recommended."
