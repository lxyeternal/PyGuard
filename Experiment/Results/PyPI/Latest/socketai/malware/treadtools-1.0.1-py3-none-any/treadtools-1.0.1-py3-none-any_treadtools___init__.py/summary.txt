  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware but exhibits unsafe practices such as executing scripts without validation and using deprecated functions. The risk stems from these unsafe practices, which could be exploited in untrusted environments. The malware score remains 0, and obfuscation is absent. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.6). The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments."
