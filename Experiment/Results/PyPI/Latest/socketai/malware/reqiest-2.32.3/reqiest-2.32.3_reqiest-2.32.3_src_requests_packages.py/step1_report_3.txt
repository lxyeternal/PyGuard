  "purpose": "Maintain backwards compatibility by importing specific modules and aliasing them within sys.modules to preserve package identity.",
  "sources": "Reading the list of modules in sys.modules and importing modules via __import__.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.modules entries, which could affect module resolution and behavior in other parts of the application.",
  "flows": "sys.modules is read to identify existing modules; modules are imported or aliased; sys.modules entries are overwritten or added to.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic modification of sys.modules to alias modules; no user input or untrusted data involved.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'urllib3' and 'idna', then rewires sys.modules entries to preserve module identity under different namespace paths. It also conditionally handles 'chardet' if available, similarly aliasing it within sys.modules. This pattern is commonly used for backward compatibility or to ensure package structure consistency. No network activity, no credential handling, and no malicious code patterns are present. The manipulations are straightforward and serve to ensure module identity consistency, not conceal malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is focused on maintaining compatibility and aliasing modules within sys.modules. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The code performs legitimate, predictable operations related to module management.",
