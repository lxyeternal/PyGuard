{
  "purpose": "Maintain backwards compatibility by aliasing certain third-party modules within the requests package namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of loaded modules in sys.modules and imports specific packages ('urllib3', 'idna', and optionally 'chardet') if not already imported.",
  "sinks": "Modifying sys.modules entries to redirect package references within the requests namespace; no external data sinks or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "The code maps 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet' modules to 'requests.packages.*' entries, ensuring compatibility with legacy code expecting these modules under the requests namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; the code only manipulates module references for compatibility. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific third-party modules ('urllib3', 'idna', and conditionally 'chardet') and remaps their sys.modules entries to emulate older package structures under 'requests.packages.*'. This is purely for backwards compatibility and does not execute untrusted code, perform data leakage, or contain malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with clear intent, and does not perform any dynamic code execution or network operations. There are no signs of sabotage or malware. It modifies module references solely within the runtime environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility shim to preserve legacy package namespace references for 'urllib3', 'idna', and 'chardet'. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is benign, ensuring older codebases continue to function correctly.",
