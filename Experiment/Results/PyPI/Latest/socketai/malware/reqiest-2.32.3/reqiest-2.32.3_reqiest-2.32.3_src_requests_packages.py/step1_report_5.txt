  "purpose": "Maintain backwards compatibility by aliasing certain packages and their submodules under 'requests.packages' namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads package modules imported or present in sys.modules, and the chardet module if available.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.modules to insert or replace references to certain modules, affecting module resolution and imports.",
  "flows": "Modules are imported or already in sys.modules -> sys.modules is modified to alias packages under 'requests.packages' -> potentially affects module resolution at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module aliasing via sys.modules; dynamic replacement of module references can impact import behavior but is common for backwards compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific packages ('urllib3', 'idna') and assigns them into sys.modules under the 'requests.packages' namespace. It also checks for a 'chardet' module and similarly aliases it if present. This pattern is typical for compatibility layers in libraries that want to support legacy import paths. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code only manipulates sys.modules for aliasing purposes, which is a known and controlled practice. There is no indication of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is designed solely for backwards compatibility, aliasing modules under a specific namespace to support legacy code. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, and the security risk is negligible.",
