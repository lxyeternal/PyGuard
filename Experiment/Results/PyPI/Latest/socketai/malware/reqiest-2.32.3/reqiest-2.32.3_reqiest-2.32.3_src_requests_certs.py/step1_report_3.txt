  "purpose": "This script returns the default CA certificate bundle path provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the CA bundle location via the 'where' function imported from the certifi package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in the code; it simply prints the CA bundle path.",
  "flows": "The source is the 'where' function, and the sink is the 'print' statement that outputs the path.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'where' from 'certifi' and prints the result when run as a main program. It is a minimal utility for returning the CA bundle path. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves a simple utility purpose. It contains no malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
