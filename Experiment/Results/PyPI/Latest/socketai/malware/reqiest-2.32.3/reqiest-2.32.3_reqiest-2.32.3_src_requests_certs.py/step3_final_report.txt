  "purpose": "This script outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package, serving as a utility to identify the trusted CA bundle location.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The script prints the CA bundle path to standard output; no untrusted data or external sinks are involved.",
  "flows": "Source: 'where' function from certifi -> Sink: print statement in main block.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing a trusted library function and printing its output. It does not process external inputs, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All reports correctly identify its benign purpose, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility that outputs the CA bundle path. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
