{
  "purpose": "To provide the default CA certificate bundle path used by the requests library, primarily for verification of SSL/TLS connections.",
  "sources": "The import of the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, and the call to 'where()' in the main block.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path, which is not a security-sensitive sink but a data output point.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> execute in main -> output CA bundle path via print.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply retrieves and prints a known, static file path from a trusted library without any unusual logic or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function to get the path to a CA bundle from the certifi package. When executed directly, it prints this path. The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. It does not handle user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources. The purpose is to provide configuration information, not perform any security-sensitive or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility to output the CA certificate bundle path. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
