  "purpose": "Return the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'where' function from certifi package.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to stdout.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> execute print(where()) -> output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no unusual behavior. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a legitimate function from the certifi package that returns the path to a trusted CA bundle. It then prints this path when run as a script. No external inputs are processed, and no data is sent over the network or stored. The code's purpose appears to be to display the default CA bundle location, which is standard for SSL/TLS verification. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate utility to display the certifi CA bundle path. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
