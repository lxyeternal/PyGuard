  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location using the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Reads from the certifi.where() function to get the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the CA bundle path via print() to standard output.",
  "flows": "Source: certifi.where() -> Sink: print() output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscation. The code simply retrieves and prints a certificate bundle location.",
  "analysis": "The code imports certifi's where() function, which returns the path to the trusted CA bundle. When executed as a script, it prints this path. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no external input processing, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to serve a utility purpose for debugging or configuration, aligned with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module that retrieves and displays the default CA bundle path. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and performs a legitimate function.",
