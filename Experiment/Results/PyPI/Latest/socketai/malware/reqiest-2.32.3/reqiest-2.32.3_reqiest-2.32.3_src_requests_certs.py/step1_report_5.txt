{
  "purpose": "Returns the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package, primarily for use in configuring HTTPS requests.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package; calling 'where()' to get the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' outputs the CA bundle path to standard output; no untrusted input or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import 'where' from certifi -> call 'where()' -> output path via print()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of certifi to obtain CA bundle location. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library 'certifi' to obtain the default certificate authority bundle path and prints it. The code is simple, lacks external data input, or any network activity. It does not perform any suspicious or malicious operations. The usage is standard and intended for environment configuration or informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended to provide the location of CA certificates. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
