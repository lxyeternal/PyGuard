  "purpose": "Define and handle various exceptions and warnings for the Requests library related to HTTP errors, connection issues, timeouts, URL problems, and other request-related exceptions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for exception classes from urllib3.exceptions and internal compat module; class definitions with their methods and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation and raising of exception classes, especially in error handling contexts. No explicit data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Error occurrence during HTTP request processing can trigger the raising of these exceptions; no external or untrusted data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious activity. Code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of exception classes for the Requests library, with constructors and methods for error handling and pickling support. No external data sources or sinks are invoked. No suspicious patterns or malicious code features are present. It is a standard exception handling module with no embedded or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate exception class definitions for the Requests library. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. It serves purely as a structured error handling framework.",
