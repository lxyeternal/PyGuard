{
  "purpose": "Defines various exception classes for handling different error scenarios in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and .compat modules; internal class definitions using these imported components.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sink points where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks; exception classes are standard error handlers.",
  "flows": "Error occurs in various exception classes during request handling; no complex data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for request-related exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exceptions and external modules. It includes typical initialization and error handling constructs with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. All classes serve to categorize errors for a larger application context. The import and class structure are standard and do not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception definitions for the Requests library, with no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and serves its purpose for error handling.",
