  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines exception classes for Requests.\n- Sources: Imports from urllib3 and compat modules; class definitions.\n- Sinks: None identified.\n- Flows: N/A, only class definitions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard exception class hierarchy; no suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, well-structured, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Exception handling in Requests.\n- Sources: Same as above.\n- Sinks: Instantiation and raising of exceptions.\n- Flows: Error handling during requests.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard exception hierarchy; no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Exception class definitions.\n- Sources: Imports from urllib3 and compat.\n- Sinks: Exception classes; no data processing.\n- Flows: Error occurrence during request handling.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical exception classes, no suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Legitimate, safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes with special attention to pickling (__reduce__).\n- Sources: Same as above.\n- Sinks: Exception instantiation, pickling (__reduce__).\n- Flows: During error handling and serialization.\n- Anomalies: The override of __reduce__ is standard for pickling support.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior; standard pattern for exception classes requiring pickling.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard implementation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — this is slightly higher but still low; justified given the pickling method override.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception class definitions.\n- Sources: Imports and class definitions.\n- Sinks: None.\n- Flows: No data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard exception classes, no malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is purely structural, defining exception classes for the Requests library.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no external data handling.\n- The only slight concern is in Report 4, where the `__reduce__` method is overridden for pickling. This is a common pattern for exceptions that need to be serializable, and not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified; exception definitions are standard.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' assessments.** The code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
