{
  "purpose": "Define a set of exception classes for handling various error scenarios in the requests library.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read; the code defines classes and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output channels that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The inheritance and class structures are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for exceptions used within the requests library, including custom error types like RequestException, HTTPError, ConnectionError, Timeout, and others. It imports exceptions from urllib3 and compat modules. No data handling, network operations, or input processing is present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception definitions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The inheritance from standard Python exceptions and the absence of external data processing imply a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class module for a HTTP request library, with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain threats. It is standard and safe.",
