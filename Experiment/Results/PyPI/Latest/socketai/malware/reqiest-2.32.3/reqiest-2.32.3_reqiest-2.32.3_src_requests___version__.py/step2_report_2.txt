  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is solely static metadata variable assignments for the 'requests' package. There are no input/output operations, data flows, or dynamic code execution. No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The only minor point is the mention of decorative emojis, which are benign and do not impact security.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, appropriate given the straightforward static assignments.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, correct since there's no malicious code.  \n- **Security risk score:** 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNo report assigns a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate. The code is purely declarative metadata with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nNo report makes unwarranted assumptions; all conclusions are supported by the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nScores are consistent across all reports and aligned with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a straightforward package metadata declaration with no security concerns.**",
