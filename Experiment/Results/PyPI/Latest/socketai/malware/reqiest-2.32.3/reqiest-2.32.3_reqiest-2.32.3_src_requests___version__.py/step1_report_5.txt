  "purpose": "Defines package metadata for the 'requests' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads static string variables defining metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only assigns static metadata values.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to any sensitive sink; only static assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and only contains metadata declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code segment solely consists of metadata variable definitions for the requests library, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious constructs. It does not include any network operations, data processing, or code execution that could be malicious. This is typical for package setup or metadata files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as metadata for the requests library. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
