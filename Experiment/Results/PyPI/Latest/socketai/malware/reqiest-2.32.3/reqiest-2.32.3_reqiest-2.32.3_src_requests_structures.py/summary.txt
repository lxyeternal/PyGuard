  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of internal data structures used within the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor implementation detail is the copy() method, which could be improved for correctness but does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's benign nature."
