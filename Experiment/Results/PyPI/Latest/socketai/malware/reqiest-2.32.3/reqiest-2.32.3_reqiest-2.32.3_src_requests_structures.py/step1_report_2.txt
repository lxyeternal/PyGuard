  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionary and lookup dictionary used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data to the constructors (via 'data', '**kwargs', or 'name' parameter).",
  "sinks": "Methods that access or retrieve data, such as __getitem__, get, or __repr__.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in self._store or self.__dict__, with case-insensitive keys mapped to original keys and values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of standard collections and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict. CaseInsensitiveDict manages headers or similar data with case-insensitive keys, storing original keys for representation. LookupDict offers a simple key-value store with optional naming for identification. Both classes use standard Python collections and methods, with no dynamic code execution or network activity. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated logic identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of case-insensitive and lookup dictionary classes used within the Requests library. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears safe and purpose-driven, with no security risks or malware indicators.",
