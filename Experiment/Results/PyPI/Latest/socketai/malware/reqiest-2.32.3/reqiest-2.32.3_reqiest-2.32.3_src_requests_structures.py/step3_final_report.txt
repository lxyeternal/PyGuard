  "purpose": "Provides internal data structures for case-insensitive headers and lookup operations within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Initialization of data in constructors, setting items via __setitem__, and accessing items via __getitem__.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration points; purely internal data management.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input data structures into internal storage, with case-insensitive lookups via lowercased keys.",
  "anomalies": "The copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict returns self._store.values(), which is a dict_values object, not a proper copy of the dictionary. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the copy is modified, but it does not pose a security risk.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes: CaseInsensitiveDict, which manages string keys in a case-insensitive manner while preserving original casing for iteration, and LookupDict, a simple wrapper with an optional name attribute. Both classes use standard Python collections and idioms, with no external system calls, network operations, or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the implementation of the copy() method in CaseInsensitiveDict, which returns self._store.values(), a dict_values object, instead of a proper copy, but this is a correctness issue, not a security concern. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be utility data structures for internal use, with no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of internal data structures used within the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor implementation detail is the copy() method, which could be improved for correctness but does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's benign nature.",
