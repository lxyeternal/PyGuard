{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class constructors, method parameters, and dictionary operations such as update, get, and __getitem__.",
  "sinks": "Data retrieval in __getitem__, get, and __iter__ methods; object instantiation in constructors.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to constructors or methods flows into internal storage (_store or __dict__) and is retrieved via __getitem__, get, or iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are present. The code uses standard library features and does not perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements two classes, CaseInsensitiveDict and LookupDict, for managing key-value pairs with specific behaviors. The classes only handle data storage, retrieval, and representation. No external inputs are processed directly outside class methods; no data is sent over network, written to files, or manipulated in insecure ways. The methods follow typical patterns for dictionary-like objects. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and standard for such data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains standard implementations of case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not include network communication, file manipulation, or other potentially harmful operations. Overall, it appears safe.",
