  "conclusion": "The embedded code is malicious, executing remote payloads immediately upon module import, representing a severe security breach. The rest of the code is legitimate, but the malicious snippet contaminates the module, indicating a supply chain compromise or backdoor. The overall security risk is maximal, and the malware is confirmed."
