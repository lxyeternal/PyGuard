{
  "purpose": "The code primarily implements classes and functions for handling HTTP requests and responses, typical of the Requests library. However, embedded within the module is a malicious snippet that decodes a base64-encoded URL, downloads an executable to the TEMP directory, and executes it immediately upon module import, representing a severe supply chain attack or backdoor.",
  "sources": "The malicious code executes at the module level during import, reading no external input but performing base64 decoding, file download via urllib.request.urlretrieve, and process execution via subprocess.Popen.",
  "sinks": "The code decodes a remote URL, downloads an executable file to a system directory, and runs it silently with subprocess.Popen, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, and malware infection.",
  "flows": "The malicious flow involves decoding the base64 string to obtain a URL, downloading the executable to the TEMP directory, and executing it immediately, all during module import without validation or user interaction.",
  "anomalies": "The inline code is outside any class or function, executing upon module load. It uses base64 encoding to hide the URL, downloads a remote executable, and runs it silently, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a clearly embedded malicious snippet that performs remote code download and execution. The rest of the code appears legitimate, typical of the Requests library. The malicious code is straightforward but intentionally obfuscated via base64 encoding. Its execution during import makes it a high-severity security concern, with immediate potential for system compromise. The malicious activity is explicit and not based on assumptions, and the code's behavior aligns with known malware patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The embedded code is malicious, executing remote payloads immediately upon module import, representing a severe security breach. The rest of the code is legitimate, but the malicious snippet contaminates the module, indicating a supply chain compromise or backdoor. The overall security risk is maximal, and the malware is confirmed.",
