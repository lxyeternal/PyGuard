{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling Python 2 and 3 differences, importing modules conditionally, and detecting character encoding libraries.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module, sys.version_info, urllib3.__version__, hardcoded strings for library names, module imports, version info, and attribute access.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module, dynamic imports of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', module attribute access, and version parsing.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info and attempts to import optional modules, then sets flags or variables accordingly. No untrusted external data flows into critical sinks; all inputs are from static code or internal library functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets (beyond library names), or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward and primarily for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility module that manages imports, version detection, and character detection library selection. It uses static strings for library names, try-except blocks for optional imports, and version parsing for urllib3. No external untrusted input influences control flow or data handling. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The logic is clear and standard for such compatibility layers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs module imports, version checks, and feature detection in a safe manner. No vulnerabilities or malware are detected.",
