{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for handling import differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and sets up utility functions and imports related to HTTP requests, character detection, and JSON handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code only performs imports and version checks",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mostly setup code for compatibility",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious behaviors detected. Code uses standard compatibility and import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages import compatibility across Python versions, checks urllib3 version, attempts to import optional character detection libraries, and sets up JSON and other utility imports. No untrusted data input, no dynamic execution, or network activity. All import practices are standard and do not pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a typical compatibility and setup module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility setup code without any malicious intent or security risks. It safely manages imports and version detection for the environment. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
