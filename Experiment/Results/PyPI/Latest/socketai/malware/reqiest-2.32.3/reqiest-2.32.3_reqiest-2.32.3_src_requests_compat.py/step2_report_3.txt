  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility setup, import handling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: All benign; no data processing or network activity.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Straightforward import and version detection; no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, no security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility and utility functions, similar to Report 1.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data handling.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard compatibility code, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no security risks.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility, import management.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data or network activity.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical setup code, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No security concerns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility, version detection, optional library import.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data flow.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Clear, standard compatibility code.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Compatibility setup, import management.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; scores are 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; scores are 0.\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no malicious behavior, no security risks are present; scores are 0.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- Given the code's benign nature, I would also assign:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n### Summary:\nThis code is a standard, benign compatibility layer with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this accurately.",
