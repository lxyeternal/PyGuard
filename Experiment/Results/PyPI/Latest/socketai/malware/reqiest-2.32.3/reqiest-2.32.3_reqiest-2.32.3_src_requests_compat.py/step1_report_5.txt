{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as importing and version-checking of libraries such as urllib3, chardet, simplejson, and standard library modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements for various standard libraries and third-party libraries, version detection, and dynamic module imports.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; primarily static imports and version checks.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up environment and library compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code uses typical compatibility patterns; nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a descriptive comment, then proceeds to import modules, handle version detection for urllib3, dynamically resolve character detection libraries, and manage compatibility between Python versions. It conditionally imports json/json, manages import errors gracefully, and sets compatibility variables. No dynamic execution of untrusted data, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code's structure and functionality are consistent with standard compatibility layers, and there are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility and import setup module with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard in nature and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
