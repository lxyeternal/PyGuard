{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility and utility functions for handling Python 2 and 3 differences, as well as importing necessary libraries such as urllib3, chardet, and json.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, simplejson/json, collections, http, io, urllib). Function _resolve_char_detection() which attempts to import 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or processing sinks present; the code primarily imports modules and defines compatibility variables.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or sinks; the code only performs imports and version checks.",
  "anomalies": "None apparent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The function _resolve_char_detection() handles optional imports cleanly, with no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up compatibility across Python versions, conditionally imports modules, and handles potential ImportErrors gracefully. It avoids executing untrusted code or performing insecure operations. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior. The only complex logic involves importing optional modules and version detection, which are standard practices in compatibility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It imports standard libraries and handles compatibility gracefully, with no suspicious or malicious intent detected.",
