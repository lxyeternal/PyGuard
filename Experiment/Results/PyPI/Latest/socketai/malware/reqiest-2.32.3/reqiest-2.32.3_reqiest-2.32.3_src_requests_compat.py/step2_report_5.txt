  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code handles compatibility, version detection, and optional library imports.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows from untrusted sources; operations are benign.  \n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, performing standard compatibility setup with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing compatibility, optional imports, and version detection.  \n- No suspicious activity or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Also benign, standard compatibility code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focuses on compatibility, version detection, and safe import practices.  \n- No untrusted data handling or network activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** No security issues or malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing static import and version detection.  \n- No suspicious patterns or anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** Clearly benign.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same pattern: compatibility setup, version detection, safe imports.  \n- No signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior—no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or data handling.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation patterns.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, the overall security risk is negligible, and a score of 0.0 or very close to it is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard compatibility module used widely in open-source projects.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The code performs benign import management, version detection, and optional library loading.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation detected. The current report scores are consistent with this assessment.",
