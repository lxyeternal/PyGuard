{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility handling between Python 2 and Python 3, manages import compatibility issues, detects library versions, and sets up environment-specific variables for use in a larger package.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from urllib3, sys, and attempts to import optional libraries such as chardet, charset_normalizer, simplejson, and various urllib modules.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data transmission or storage.",
  "flows": "The code performs version detection and conditional imports without any data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection, optional library imports, and sets compatibility flags. It uses try-except blocks to handle missing modules gracefully. No untrusted data is processed, and no network or file operations are performed beyond imports and version checks. The code is a typical compatibility layer with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign compatibility utility that handles import differences and version detection. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0.",
