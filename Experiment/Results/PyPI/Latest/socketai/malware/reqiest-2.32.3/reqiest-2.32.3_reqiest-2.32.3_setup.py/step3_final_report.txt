  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'requests' Python library, including version checks, dependency definitions, and upload commands.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from '__version__.py' via exec(), reading README.md, and fixed commands in os.system() for publishing.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes code from external file; os.system() runs static shell commands.",
  "flows": "exec() executes code read from '__version__.py'; os.system() runs static commands for 'sdist', 'bdist_wheel', and upload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external version file, which could be tampered with; syntax error in open() call (should specify encoding='utf-8').",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks with minimal security issues. The main concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could execute malicious code if the version file is compromised. The os.system() commands are static and safe in this context. No obfuscation or malware signatures are present. The syntax error in open() should be corrected for proper execution. The malware score is 0, as no malicious routines are detected. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is approximately 0.3, considering the exec() pattern as a potential vector if the version file is tampered with. Confidence in these conclusions is around 0.8-0.9.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a minor security concern regarding the use of exec() to load version info. No malicious activity or malware is evident. The scores assigned are appropriate, but replacing exec() with safer parsing methods would improve security. The overall risk is low, but the pattern warrants attention if the version file's integrity cannot be guaranteed.",
