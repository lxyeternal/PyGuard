  "purpose": "Provides compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies in the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion between different formats.",
  "sources": "Reading request URLs, headers, cookies, and cookie attributes from request objects and responses.",
  "sinks": "Adding cookie headers to requests, creating and setting cookies in the jar, removing cookies by name, and updating or copying cookie jars.",
  "flows": "Extract cookies from response into jar -> Generate cookie header from jar -> Set cookies into jar -> Remove or update cookies in jar",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of standard modules and straightforward cookie management functions.",
  "analysis": "The code offers a comprehensive set of utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, wrapping around standard Python cookie handling modules. It includes classes for cookie jar compatibility, mock request/response wrappers, and functions for extracting, setting, removing, and merging cookies. All data flows involve standard cookie operations with no evidence of data leakage, malicious data manipulation, or unauthorized system access. The code does not perform any network connections, system modifications, or obfuscated operations. Its design aligns with legitimate cookie handling and compatibility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, legitimate utility code for cookie management within the requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It functions as a compatibility layer and utility toolkit for cookie operations without any harmful side effects.",
