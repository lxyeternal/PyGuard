  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** The report states that the code provides compatibility and utility functions for cookie handling, with no signs of malicious behavior. It correctly identifies that the code wraps standard cookiejar functionalities, with classes like `MockRequest`, `MockResponse`, and functions for extracting and managing cookies.\n\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The confidence level is high (0.9). The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign description; perhaps it accounts for potential misuse of functions like `remove_cookie_by_name`, but overall, the assessment aligns with the code.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues present. The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard, benign utility for cookie management. It highlights standard library usage, no suspicious code, and no malicious intent.\n\n- **Findings:** The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, confidence is 1. All consistent. No obfuscation or anomalies.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues detected. The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, the report emphasizes the code's role as a standard cookie utility, with no signs of malicious behavior. It correctly notes the use of standard modules and functions.\n\n- **Findings:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0, confidence is 1. No anomalies or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to previous reports, confirming that the code is a standard, legitimate utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Findings:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, confidence 0.9. The assessment is consistent.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates that the code is a compatibility utility for cookie management, with no malicious intent or suspicious code.\n\n- **Findings:** Malware score 0, security risk 0, confidence 0.95. All consistent.\n\n- **Verdict:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a well-structured, standard utility for cookie management, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports — justified.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 across all reports — justified.\n  - Security risk: Generally low (0.2) in some reports, but given the code's benign nature, even this might be slightly overestimated. The code's functions could be misused to delete cookies, but this is standard behavior.\n\n- **Potential concerns:** No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The functions are standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minimal, mostly due to potential misuse of cookie deletion functions, but not a security vulnerability per se)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard utility for cookie management within the requests library, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The reports are accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context of how such utility functions could be misused. However, in this case, the code's design and purpose are benign and aligned with standard cookie handling practices.",
