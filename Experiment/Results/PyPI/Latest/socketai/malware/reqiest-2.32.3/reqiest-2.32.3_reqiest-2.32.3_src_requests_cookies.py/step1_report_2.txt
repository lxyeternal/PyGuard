  "purpose": "The code provides compatibility utilities for handling cookies within the 'requests' library, including classes and functions to manage cookies, convert cookies, and extract cookies from responses.",
  "sources": "Reading request URL and headers in MockRequest, response headers in extract_cookies_to_jar, cookie parameters in create_cookie, and cookie attributes in morsel_to_cookie.",
  "sinks": "Cookie manipulation functions such as set_cookie, remove_cookie_by_name, and update; cookie header generation in get_cookie_header.",
  "flows": "Input data from request URL, headers, and cookie dictionaries flows into cookie creation and setting functions; cookies are extracted from responses and stored in cookie jars, then potentially used to generate Cookie headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code primarily handles standard cookie operations with standard libraries, and no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. The functions include safe handling of cookie data and conversion routines.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility layer for cookie management within the requests library, wrapping around standard Python 'http.cookiejar' functionalities. It includes classes for mock request/response objects, cookie extraction, and manipulation of cookie jars, supporting dictionary-like operations. All functions handle typical cookie data and conversion processes without any suspicious or malicious behaviors. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system harm mechanisms are present. The implementation appears standard and intended solely for cookie handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of cookie management utilities for requests. It performs expected operations related to cookies without any malicious intent or security risks.",
