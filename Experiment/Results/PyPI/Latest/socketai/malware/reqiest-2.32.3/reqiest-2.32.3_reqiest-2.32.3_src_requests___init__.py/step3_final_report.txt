  "purpose": "Dependency and environment validation for the 'requests' library, including version checks, warnings, and fallback mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports of external modules (urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, ssl, cryptography), version variables, assertion statements, and warnings.",
  "sinks": "Assertions and warnings that could halt execution or alert users; no untrusted data processing or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Version variables are checked and asserted; warnings are issued based on version checks; fallback mechanisms are invoked if SSL support is lacking.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard dependency validation procedures; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine dependency validation, version assertions, and environment setup typical for a Python library. It imports external modules, checks their versions, issues warnings if dependencies are incompatible or missing, and configures SSL fallback if necessary. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The assertions and warnings are used for validation purposes, not for executing untrusted code. The overall structure is straightforward and aligns with standard library initialization practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious setup and validation script for the requests library. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements and poses a very low security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting routine dependency checks with minimal security implications.",
