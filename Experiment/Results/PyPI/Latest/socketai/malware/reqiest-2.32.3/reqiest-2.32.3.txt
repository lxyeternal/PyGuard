      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a minor security concern regarding the use of exec() to load version info. No malicious activity or malware is evident. The scores assigned are appropriate, but replacing exec() with safer parsing methods would improve security. The overall risk is low, but the pattern warrants attention if the version file's integrity cannot be guaranteed."

It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The only minor implementation detail is the copy() method, which could be improved for correctness but does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's benign nature."
