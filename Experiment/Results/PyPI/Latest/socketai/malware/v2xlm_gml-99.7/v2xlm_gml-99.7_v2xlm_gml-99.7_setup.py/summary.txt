  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation introduces a high security risk and potential for malicious behavior. The current reports are accurate; scores should be increased to reflect the high severity, with malware scores around 0.8 and security risk scores at or above 0.8. This pattern should be flagged for further review and caution, as it can be exploited for supply chain attacks."
