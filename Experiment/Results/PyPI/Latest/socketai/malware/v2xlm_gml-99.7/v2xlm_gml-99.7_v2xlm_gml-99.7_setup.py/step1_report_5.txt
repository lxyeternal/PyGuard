{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that installs dependencies and runs a custom installation step which executes code from main.py.",
  "sources": "The code imports and runs the 'main' function from main.py during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from main.py during install; potential for arbitrary code execution if main.py is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method calls 'main()' from main.py, which could execute arbitrary code.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes code from main.py as part of the install process; no other suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom install command that, after standard installation, imports and executes the 'main()' function from main.py. This behavior is unusual because it causes code execution during package installation. If main.py contains malicious code, it would run with the permissions of the installer, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. No other suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The rest of the setup is standard. The execution of external code during install poses a security risk if the source of main.py is untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "The package runs external code from main.py during installation, which could be malicious if main.py is compromised. This behavior warrants caution, especially if the package source is untrusted.",
