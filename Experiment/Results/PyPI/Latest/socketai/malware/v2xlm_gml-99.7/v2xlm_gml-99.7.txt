      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during installation introduces a high security risk and potential for malicious behavior. The current reports are accurate; scores should be increased to reflect the high severity, with malware scores around 0.8 and security risk scores at or above 0.8. This pattern should be flagged for further review and caution, as it can be exploited for supply chain attacks."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration behavior to suspicious external servers, posing a high security and privacy risk. While no active malicious payloads are present, the activity's nature is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The scores should reflect this, with a malware score of 0.8 and a security risk score of 0.9. The code is not obfuscated, and the activity warrants high caution and further investigation."
