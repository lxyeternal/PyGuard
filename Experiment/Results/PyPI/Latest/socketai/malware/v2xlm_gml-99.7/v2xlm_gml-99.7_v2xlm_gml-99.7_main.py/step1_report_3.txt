  "purpose": "Collects system information and sends it to multiple external URLs, potentially for tracking or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd() - reading system hostname, username, and current working directory.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() - sending data to external URLs; logging.info() - potentially exposing response data in logs.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded into URL parameters and sent to external URLs via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Sending system info (hostname, username, current path) to external servers without user consent; multiple URLs with suspicious domains; use of random number for URL parameters; no validation or encryption of data.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters along with a random number. It makes HTTP GET requests to external domains, which appear suspicious due to their structure and the pattern of data transmission. The URLs are on domains that could be malicious or used for tracking. The code logs response content, which might leak sensitive info in logs. The overall behavior resembles data exfiltration or tracking activity without user awareness. No obvious malicious payload or backdoor is present, but the act of transmitting system info to untrusted servers is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects system information and transmits it to external URLs, which is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes such as tracking or data theft. The activity is covert and lacks user consent, indicating potential malicious intent.",
