  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which sends data to external URLs",
  "flows": "system info (hostname, username, current path, random number) -> URL parameters -> HTTP request to external servers",
  "anomalies": "The code constructs URLs that send system info to suspicious domains; no user input is involved but the remote URLs are obscure and potentially malicious; uses random number for request uniqueness; no validation or encryption of data.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific details such as hostname, username, and current working directory. It generates a random number to likely vary each request. It constructs three URLs with embedded parameters, then attempts to send GET requests to these URLs, logging responses or errors. The domains are suspicious, with no apparent legitimate purpose. The code does not perform any benign or necessary functions; it appears to covertly transmit system info to external servers, which is characteristic of data exfiltration or tracking malware. There are no obfuscation techniques or complex logic, but the behavior indicates malicious intent due to the nature of the external URLs and data collection.",
  "conclusion": "The script collects and transmits system information to suspicious external domains without user consent, indicating malicious intent. It can be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or data exfiltration, representing a security risk.",
