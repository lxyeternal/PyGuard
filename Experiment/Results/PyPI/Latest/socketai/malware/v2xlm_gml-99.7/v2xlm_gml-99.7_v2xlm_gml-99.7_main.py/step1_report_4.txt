  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to external URLs with generated parameters.",

  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which sends data to external URLs",
  "flows": "Source functions generate data -> URL parameters constructed -> URL fetched with urllib.request.urlopen()",
  "anomalies": "The URLs used are suspicious and potentially malicious, especially as they are non-standard domains and include random numerical paths; no legitimate purpose for sending hostname, username, and current directory to such domains is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, and current directory, generates a random number, and sends these along with a package name to multiple external URLs. The URLs are obfuscated and suspicious, indicating possible data exfiltration. The code does not perform any visible malicious actions like executing system commands, writing files, or network reconnaissance beyond these HTTP requests. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or complex features, but the behavior of sending system info to untrusted endpoints suggests malicious intent. The URLs and data collection are typical of potential data theft or tracking activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system info and sends it to suspicious external URLs, indicating potential data exfiltration. The URLs are suspicious, and the behavior resembles a tracker or data theft script. Overall, this code exhibits malicious intent and should be considered high risk.",
