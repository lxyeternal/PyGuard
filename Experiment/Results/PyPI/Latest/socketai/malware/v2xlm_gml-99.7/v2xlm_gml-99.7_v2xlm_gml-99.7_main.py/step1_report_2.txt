  "purpose": "The code gathers system information (hostname, username, current directory) and sends it to multiple external URLs with a random identifier as part of a request parameter.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Constructs URLs with system info and sends HTTP requests to external servers via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current path, random number) is collected and encoded into URL parameters, then sent over HTTP to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code sends potentially sensitive system information to multiple external URLs without user consent or transparency. The URLs are suspicious and obscure, hosted on domains with no clear purpose. No input validation or user interaction. The repeated requests to external URLs with system data suggest data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number, then constructs URLs with this data embedded as query parameters. It attempts to connect to these URLs and logs responses. The URLs are obscure and likely malicious, potentially used for exfiltrating system info. No validation, encryption, or user notification is present, indicating malicious intent. The use of try-except is to handle failures silently, consistent with covert data transmission. The overall behavior resembles a simple data exfiltration or command-and-control beacon, which is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform covert data collection and exfiltration of system information to suspicious external servers. It lacks transparency and involves sending potentially sensitive data without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
