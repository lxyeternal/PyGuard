  "purpose": "Attempt to import a module and initialize an emoji converter, with fallback logging on import failure.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pyprettifier' and the exception handling block that writes to '/tmp/a'.",
  "sinks": "Writing to '/tmp/a' in case of ImportError; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Import attempt (source) -> exception handling -> writing to file (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code writes the import error message to a file in '/tmp'. This is not inherently malicious but could be used to log errors silently. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function 'after_install' that tries to import 'pyprettifier' and initialize an EmojiConverter object. If the import fails, it logs the error message to '/tmp/a'. The main block executes this function. There are no other operations, network calls, or suspicious behavior. The write to '/tmp/a' could be used for debugging or silent error logging, but it is not malicious by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing a simple import with error logging. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The only minor concern is silent error logging, which is not malicious.",
