  "anomalies": "Error message written to a temporary file; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import and object creation, with error handling that logs to a temporary file. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The error logging could potentially leak information but is typical for debugging. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or secrets. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign a malware score of 0, with low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple import with error logging. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The minor concern about error message leakage is typical and does not indicate malicious intent.",
