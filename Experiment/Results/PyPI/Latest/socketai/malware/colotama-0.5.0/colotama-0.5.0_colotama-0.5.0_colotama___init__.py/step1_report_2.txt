  "flows": "This code only performs an import; there are no data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initialization file that imports a 'cli' component from a local module. It contains only a single import statement, with no input handling, data processing, or network activity. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. The simplicity and standard nature of this code suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be part of a normal package initialization process.",
