  "purpose": "Initialize the Python package by importing the 'cli' component from the local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; standard import operation",
  "flows": "Importing 'cli' from local module without data flow or external influence",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal __init__.py file that imports 'cli' from a local module. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. The import is standard for Python package initialization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and transparency support a benign assessment. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and standard pattern.",
