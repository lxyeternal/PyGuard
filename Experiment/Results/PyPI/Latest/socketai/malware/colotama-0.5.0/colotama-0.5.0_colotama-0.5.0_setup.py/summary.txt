  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors that are risky and could be exploited maliciously, such as executing arbitrary scripts and installing packages during setup via shell commands with unvalidated paths. While no active malicious payloads are evident, the potential for abuse is high, warranting a high security risk score."
