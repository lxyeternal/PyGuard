  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network calls, file operations, dynamic code execution (eval, exec), hardcoded URLs/IPs, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, user inputs) to sinks via code execution, network transmission, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, suspicious network domains, hardcoded IPs/URLs, deprecated libraries, potential data exfiltration routines.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of malicious activity, including dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, and potential data exfiltration. The presence of eval/exec indicates malicious intent, supported by suspicious network endpoints and obfuscation techniques. No benign indicators are present. Other code snippets show no signs of malicious behavior, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The overall flow from input sources to malicious sinks confirms malicious intent in the flagged code.",
  "conclusion": "The code in the dependency contains high-probability malicious behavior, with indicators such as dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, and obfuscation. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. The benign code snippets show no malicious signs. The high scores in the malicious code are justified based on the detailed indicators.",
