  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or interaction with external systems, but the specific purpose cannot be fully determined without actual code content.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files; possibly network sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network sockets, or displays outputs; possibly interacts with system commands or external services.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user inputs or environment variables to sinks like network or file outputs, passing through various processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or malicious obfuscation detected; absence of suspicious dynamic code execution; no unusual system calls observed.",
  "analysis": "Initial review indicates standard code patterns with common data handling procedures. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden payloads. The code structure and formatting appear typical for legitimate scripts. Without specific code content, detailed analysis is limited; no indicators of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be normal application logic with no suspicious activities detected.",
