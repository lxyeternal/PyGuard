  "conclusion": "The code in the dependency contains high-probability malicious behavior, with indicators such as dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, and obfuscation. The overall security risk is high, and the malware likelihood is significant. The benign code snippets show no malicious signs. The high scores in the malicious code are justified based on the detailed indicators."
