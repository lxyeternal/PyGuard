{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect various user and system information during package installation and send it to a specified remote server, potentially for malicious tracking or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from getpass (username), socket (hostname, IP addresses), platform (OS info), and network requests to external APIs (public IP and geolocation).",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via HTTP POST request to an external server at SERVER_URL; this is the primary sink where untrusted data flows out of the script.",
  "flows": "Sources such as getpass.getuser(), socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), socket IP, and network calls flow into the data dictionary, which is then serialized and transmitted via send_data_to_server to the remote endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "The script unconditionally collects and transmits user information, including hostname, username, IPs, and geolocation, during installation without explicit user consent. It uses threading for asynchronous sending, which could be suspicious if masked as benign. The collection of geolocation and IP data in the context of package installation is unusual and potentially malicious. No passwords or sensitive data are collected, but the extent of data gathering is extensive.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a malicious-like behavior by collecting user identifiers, network information, and geolocation data during the installation process. It explicitly states it does not collect passwords and mentions illegal collection, but it still performs extensive data gathering. The data collection is implemented in the post-install hook, executed during package installation, and sent to an external server, which is typical of supply chain attacks or data exfiltration. The use of threading to send data asynchronously appears to obfuscate or avoid detection, though it is a common technique. There are no signs of code obfuscation, backdoors, or encryption of data. Overall, the code behaves like a malicious data-collecting agent disguised as a benign package.",
  "conclusion": "This package contains malicious behavior by collecting detailed user and system information during installation and transmitting it to a remote server without user consent. The code is designed to perform stealthy data exfiltration, making it potentially dangerous for supply chain security. Its intent appears malicious, although technically it does not contain traditional malware such as backdoors or system damage code. Overall risk is high due to privacy invasion and data exfiltration concerns.",
