{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect user and system information during package installation and send it to a remote server, potentially for malicious tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "sources": "Data is collected from getpass.getuser(), socket.gethostname(), platform.system(), socket connections for local IP, and HTTP requests to external IP and geolocation services.",
  "sinks": "The collected data is serialized into JSON and sent via HTTP POST request to a specified remote server (SERVER_URL).",
  "flows": "Data flows from various system information functions (collect_user_data) through serialization (json.dumps) into network transmission (request.urlopen) to the remote server.",
  "anomalies": "The code secretly collects extensive user info including username, hostname, OS details, local IP, public IP, and geolocation without explicit user consent. It also posts this data asynchronously during installation, which is suspicious. The hardcoded server IP and URL, along with the comment about collecting data illegally, indicate malicious intent. The code uses threading to avoid blocking, which could be an attempt to conceal the data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a malicious package that, during installation, gathers detailed user and system information, including network details and geolocation, without user knowledge. It then transmits this data silently to a remote server. The code avoids typical malicious signatures like code obfuscation but employs techniques such as background threading and network requests to external APIs for data collection. The explicit comment about illegal data collection and the design to run data exfiltration during the install process point toward intentional malicious activity. The data collection scope and the secrecy of transmission strongly suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits malicious behavior, primarily data exfiltration of user and system information during package installation. It operates covertly, with no user consent, and could be used for tracking, privacy invasion, or other malicious purposes. The overall security risk is high.",
