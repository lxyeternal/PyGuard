{
  "purpose": "The code collects extensive system and network information during package installation and exfiltrates it to a remote server without explicit user consent, primarily for covert data gathering.",
  "sources": "System info functions (getpass.getuser, socket.gethostname, platform.system, socket connection for internal IP, network requests to api.ipify.org and ip-api.com for external IP and geolocation)",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to hardcoded remote server URL (http://38.181.219.70:5000/collect) transmitting JSON-encoded data",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system/network info functions into a dictionary, serialized into JSON, then sent via network request during the custom install command executed post-setup, using threading to perform transmission asynchronously",
  "anomalies": "Data collection occurs during installation without user awareness, using threading to obscure transmission, comments explicitly mention illegal data collection, no password collection, code is straightforward without obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate-looking system info collection and network requests but does so during package installation without user consent, indicating covert exfiltration. Exception handling prevents install failures. Use of threading aims to hide or delay data transmission. The data collected includes sensitive info like IP addresses and geolocation, which are transmitted to a remote server. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present, but the behavior is privacy-invasive and stealthy, aligning with malicious activity. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.75-0.9, security risk ~0.8-0.9, obfuscation 0) are consistent with this behavior. The code's intent and execution justify high malware and risk scores, with the absence of obfuscation correctly scored as 0.",
  "conclusion": "The package performs covert, privacy-invasive data collection and exfiltration during installation, with behavior consistent with malicious or highly suspicious activity. The scores are justified and align with the observed behavior, warranting caution or flagging as malicious.",
