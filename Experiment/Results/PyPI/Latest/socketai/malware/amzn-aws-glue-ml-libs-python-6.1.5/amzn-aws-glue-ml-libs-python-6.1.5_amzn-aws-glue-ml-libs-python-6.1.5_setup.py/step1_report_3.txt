{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package setup configuration with a custom installation process that performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'README.md' file to generate the long description.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() call sends a request to an external server, which could leak information or be used for tracking purposes.",
  "flows": "During package installation, the custom 'PostInstallCommand' executes 'post_install()', which makes an HTTP request to the specified URL. This occurs immediately after the package installation process begins.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an unsolicited network request during installation, which is unusual behavior for a standard setup script. The URL accessed ('http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python') is suspicious and not related to typical package metadata or functionality. The request is duplicated: once outside any function at the top level, and once inside the post_install() function called during installation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and sets up a package using setuptools. It immediately performs an HTTP GET request to an external URL at the module level, which is unusual and potentially malicious, as it triggers on import. Additionally, the custom 'PostInstallCommand' executes the same request during package installation, further indicating that the code is designed to contact an external server during setup. The URL is a non-standard, potentially malicious endpoint, possibly used for tracking, data exfiltration, or command-and-control activities. No other suspicious code or backdoors are present; however, the repeated external contact is a significant red flag. The code's purpose appears to be to send data to or check in with an external server during install, which could be used maliciously to track or control the environment where the package is installed.",
  "conclusion": "This package includes malicious or suspicious behavior by making unsolicited network requests to an external server during import and installation. The URL accessed is suspicious and indicates potential tracking or malicious command-and-control activities. The code poses a security risk due to its unexpected network communications during setup.",
