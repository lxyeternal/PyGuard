{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package with a post-install step that makes an HTTP request to a specified external server.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded URLs within the requests.get() calls at the beginning and inside the post_install() function.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP requests send data to an external server, potentially leaking information or allowing remote monitoring.",
  "flows": "The code executes an HTTP GET request at startup and again after installation completes, sending data to http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes unsolicited requests to a suspicious external domain during both module load and post-installation, which is unusual behavior for a typical setup script. The repeated request to the same URL without any clear purpose or user consent is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and the 'requests' library. It performs an external HTTP GET request immediately upon loading, which is unconventional and potentially malicious. The setup() function includes a custom install command that triggers another request to the same external server after installation, possibly to exfiltrate system info or confirm installation. There are no other malicious code segments like file modification, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The repeated requests and external contact are suspicious, especially since the target domain appears non-standard and possibly malicious. Overall, the code exhibits behavior consistent with data exfiltration or remote command-and-control contact during both load and installation phases.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates suspicious behavior by making external network requests during module load and post-installation without any transparent purpose. This pattern is often used in malicious packages to communicate with command-and-control servers or exfiltrate data. While no other malicious actions are present, the external contact itself raises significant security concerns.",
