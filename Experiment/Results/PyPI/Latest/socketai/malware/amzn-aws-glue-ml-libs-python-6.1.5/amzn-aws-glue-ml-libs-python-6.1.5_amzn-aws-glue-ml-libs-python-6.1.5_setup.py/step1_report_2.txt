{
  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup with a custom post-installation step that makes an HTTP request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "requests.get() calls to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python' executed during module import and post-install.",
  "sinks": "The HTTP request made during import and post-install may send or receive data from an external server, potentially leaking system info or receiving malicious instructions.",
  "flows": "Code executes requests.get() upon import, and again during the post-install command, potentially transmitting system info or receiving malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "The code makes network requests to a suspicious domain (pov.sh) during import and post-install, which is unusual for typical package setup scripts. The request is duplicated, indicating possible command and control or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and the requests library. It makes an immediate HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL during module import. Additionally, the custom post-install command also makes the same request. This behavior can be used to exfiltrate data, check for malicious commands, or serve malicious payloads. The repeated external calls and connection to an obscure domain are suspicious. No other malicious code or backdoors are present. The setup process itself appears standard but is compromised by external network activity during installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by making external network requests to a suspicious server during import and installation, which could be used for command-and-control, data exfiltration, or malicious payload delivery. This warrants a high-security concern and should be treated as malicious or compromised.",
