{
  "purpose": "To define and set up a Python package with a custom post-installation behavior that performs an HTTP GET request to a specific URL.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'requests' library and makes HTTP GET requests to 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python'.",
  "sinks": "The requests.get() calls send data over the network to an external server, potentially exposing system or environment information.",
  "flows": "The code initiates HTTP GET requests immediately upon import and during the custom install command execution, reaching out to an external server.",
  "anomalies": "The URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python' is hardcoded, which is suspicious. The code makes network requests during both import and installation, which is unusual for standard package setup scripts. The repeated requests may indicate malicious intent such as tracking or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and the 'requests' library, then makes a network call immediately upon execution, which is atypical for a package setup script. A custom 'PostInstallCommand' class is defined to perform the same request during package installation. Hardcoded URL and the act of contacting an external server during both import and install phases suggest potential malicious behavior, such as unauthorized data collection or remote control. No other suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or credential theft mechanisms are evident beyond this network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unsolicited network requests to an external server during import and installation, which is suspicious behavior indicative of potential data exfiltration or tracking. This pattern is commonly associated with malicious or privacy-invasive code, raising security concerns.",
