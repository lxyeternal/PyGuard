{
  "purpose": "The code makes external HTTP GET requests to a suspicious URL during module import and post-installation, likely for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.",
  "sources": "The requests.get() calls at the module level and within the post_install() function, triggered during import and installation phases.",
  "sinks": "The external URL 'http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python' which could be used for data exfiltration, remote command execution, or tracking.",
  "flows": "Source: requests.get() at module load and inside post_install() -> Sink: external server at pov.sh:45111 during import and install phases.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual network requests during module import and setup, repeated contact to a suspicious domain, no legitimate purpose for external communication in a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unsolicited external HTTP requests during both import and post-install phases, targeting a suspicious domain. These behaviors are atypical for standard packages and suggest malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or remote control. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but the repeated contact to an obscure URL is highly suspicious. The high malware and security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified by this behavior. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present, but the external contact alone warrants high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits behaviors characteristic of malicious or compromised code due to repeated external network requests during import and installation. The high malware and security risk scores are justified, and the package should be treated as highly suspicious or malicious until further verified.",
