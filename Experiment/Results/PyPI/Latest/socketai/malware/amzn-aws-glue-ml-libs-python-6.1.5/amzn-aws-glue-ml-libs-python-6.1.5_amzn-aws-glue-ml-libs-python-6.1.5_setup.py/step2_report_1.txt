  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**1. Confirm if the issues are present in the code:**\n- The code explicitly contains two `requests.get()` calls:\n  - One at the module level (executed immediately upon import).\n  - One inside the `post_install()` function, called during the custom install command.\n- Both requests target the URL `http://pov.sh:45111/api/v3/amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python`.\n- The code makes no other malicious modifications or payloads.\n\n**2. Logical errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports consistently identify the external HTTP requests as suspicious, which is valid.\n- They correctly note that making network requests during import and installation is unusual and often malicious.\n- No claims are made about code obfuscation, which aligns with the code clarity.\n- The reports reasonably interpret the repeated external contact as malicious or at least suspicious.\n\n**3. Scores given to each issue:**\n- **Malware scores:** Range from 0.6 to 0.9.\n- **Security risk scores:** Range from 0.75 to 0.9.\n- These are high, reflecting significant concern.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- The external requests are made during both import and install phases, which is unusual and suspicious.\n- The target URL `pov.sh:45111` appears non-standard and potentially malicious.\n- Repeated contact to an external, obscure domain strongly suggests malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, command-and-control, or tracking.\n- The high malware scores (up to 0.9) are justified given the pattern of behavior.\n\n**5. Malware scores and their reflection:**\n- The malware scores (0.6 to 0.9) are based solely on external contact behavior.\n- No actual malicious payloads, code execution, or backdoors are present.\n- The scores seem reasonable but could be slightly lowered if we consider no active payloads are delivered.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions:**\n- The reports assume malicious intent based on external contact. While suspicious, this alone doesn't confirm malicious payloads.\n- However, in security analysis, such behavior is often associated with malicious activity, especially when the URL is suspicious.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the described behavior.\n- Higher malware and risk scores correspond to more aggressive external contact and suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**a. Presence of issues:**  \nYes, the code makes external requests to a suspicious URL during import and post-install, which is suspicious.\n\n**b. Logical flaws in reports:**  \nNo significant flaws; all reports correctly identify the suspicious external contact.\n\n**c. Score adjustments:**  \n- The malware scores could be slightly reduced from 0.9 to around 0.8, considering no payloads are confirmed.\n- The security risk scores are appropriate given the external contact pattern.\n\n**d. Justification for high scores:**  \n- External contact to an obscure domain during critical phases (import and install).\n- Repeated requests without legitimate purpose.\n- The pattern aligns with known malicious behaviors like data exfiltration or C2 communication.\n\n**e. Potential false positives:**  \n- If this code is part of a legitimate security testing environment, the behavior might be justified. But in general, such external contact in a package setup is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Original Report Range | My Estimated Score | Justification                                                      |\n|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware Score    | 0.6 - 0.9               | **0.8**              | Repeated suspicious external contact, no payloads but high suspicion |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                       | **0**                | Code is clear, no obfuscation                                       |\n| Risk Score       | 0.75 - 0.9              | **0.85**             | External contact during setup, potential exfiltration or C2 activity |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code's behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious due to repeated external network requests during import and installation.\n- The scores in the reports are justified but could be slightly adjusted downward for the malware score.\n- Overall, the package should be treated as high risk until further analysis confirms benign intent.\n\n**Final note:** Always verify the context and environment where such code runs before making definitive conclusions.",
