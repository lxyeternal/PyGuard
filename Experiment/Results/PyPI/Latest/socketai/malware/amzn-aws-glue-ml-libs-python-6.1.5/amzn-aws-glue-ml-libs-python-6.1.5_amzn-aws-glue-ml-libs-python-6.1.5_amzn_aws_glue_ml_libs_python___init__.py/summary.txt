  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior due to the external URL, justifying a moderate security risk score. The malware likelihood is moderate, given the lack of active malicious payloads but the suspicious nature of the URL. No obfuscation is present. Further investigation into the URL's purpose is recommended."
