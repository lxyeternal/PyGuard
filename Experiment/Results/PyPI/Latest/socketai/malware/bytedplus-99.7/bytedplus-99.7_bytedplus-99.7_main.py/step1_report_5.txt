  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path, random number) are encoded into URL parameters and sent via HTTP requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple external URLs with obfuscated domain names; sending system info without user consent; no validation of responses; no apparent legitimate purpose",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system hostname, username, current directory, and generates a random number. It constructs URLs to three external domains and sends GET requests containing these parameters. The responses are logged. No input validation or user consent mechanisms are present. The domains appear suspicious and could be used for tracking or malicious data exfiltration. The code structure is straightforward, but the purpose of sending system data to these URLs without user knowledge is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect and exfiltrate system information to external servers, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes. The use of multiple suspicious URLs and automatic data transmission without user consent raises security concerns. Overall, this code has a high likelihood of malicious intent and should be regarded as malicious.",
