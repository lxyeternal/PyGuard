  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to remote URLs for tracking or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP GET requests to specified external URLs using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, username, current directory, and a random number; encodes these as URL parameters; sends to each URL in the list.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple external URLs that appear suspicious; no authentication or encryption; no clear purpose stated. The data transmission to multiple third-party domains suggests potential tracking or malicious activity. The use of random numbers in URL parameters may be to avoid detection or for session identification.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers system-specific information such as hostname, username, and current directory, which could be sensitive. It then constructs URLs with these parameters and sends HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains, potentially for tracking or exfiltration. The URLs look suspicious and are hosted on domains that could be used for malicious purposes. The code does not sanitize or validate the data, and it operates silently without user consent. There are no obvious security flaws like code injection, but the behavior indicates data exfiltration or tracking activity, which is malicious in intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect system information and transmit it to external domains without user consent, indicating potential malicious activity such as data exfiltration or tracking. The suspicious URLs and lack of transparency are warning signs. Overall, this code has a high likelihood of malicious behavior.",
