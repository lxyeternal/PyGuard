  "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' during installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if 'main()' contains harmful code. The pattern is suspicious and warrants caution. The malware score should be high enough to reflect this risk, and the overall security risk is significant. Without inspecting 'main.py', the exact maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the pattern itself is a known attack vector."
