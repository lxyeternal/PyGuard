  "conclusion": "The code functions as malware, performing stealthy collection and exfiltration of sensitive data to obfuscated external servers. Its behaviors, including obfuscation, broad data collection, and multiple exfiltration points, justify high malware and security risk scores. The obfuscation via base64 URLs warrants a high obfuscated score. Overall, it poses a significant security threat and should be classified as malicious."
