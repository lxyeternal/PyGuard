{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then send this data to multiple webhooks, potentially for malicious data exfiltration.",
  "sources": [
    "Base64 encoded URLs (decoded for webhook endpoints).",
    "System information functions retrieving username, hostname, HWID, and IP address.",
    "find_discord_tokens() reads various leveldb files in user directories.",
    "find_browser_passwords() accesses Chrome's 'Login Data' SQLite database.",
    "find_minecraft_accounts() reads specific JSON files for game accounts."
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "requests.post() calls to send collected data to external URLs.",
    "Reading files from user directories and system commands (e.g., wmic).",
    "Potentially encrypted password data sent as base64-encoded strings."
  ],
  "flows": [
    "System info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts are gathered via respective functions.",
    "All data is passed into send_to_webhook(), which posts to multiple decoded webhook URLs.",
    "Data flows from source functions directly into network sinks via requests.post."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "The URLs are base64-encoded, which could be an attempt to obfuscate target endpoints.",
    "The code collects sensitive data (Discord tokens, passwords, HWID) without user consent.",
    "Encrypted passwords are base64-encoded and sent as-is without decryption.",
    "Repeated attempts to send data to multiple webhook URLs could indicate data aggregation for malicious purposes.",
    "System commands (wmic) are used to gather hardware info, which could be used for fingerprinting."
  ],
  "analysis": "The script functions as a data collector and exfiltrator, designed to harvest sensitive user information including system details, Discord tokens, stored browser passwords, and Minecraft account info. The use of base64 encoding for URLs suggests an attempt to obfuscate the malicious intent. All data is sent to multiple external webhook endpoints, which are decoded from base64 at runtime. The code does not perform any destructive actions but focuses on covert data collection and exfiltration, indicative of a malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits high malicious potential, primarily due to its data harvesting and exfiltration mechanisms targeting sensitive user data, with obfuscated communication endpoints. It does not perform destructive actions but is clearly designed to spy on users and send data to external servers, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.",
