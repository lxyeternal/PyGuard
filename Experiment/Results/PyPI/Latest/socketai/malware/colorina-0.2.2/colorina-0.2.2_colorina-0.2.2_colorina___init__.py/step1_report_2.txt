{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then exfiltrates this data via multiple webhooks.",
  "sources": "User environment variables (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, USERPROFILE), file system (Discord local storage, browser login data, Minecraft configs), system commands (wmic), network requests (requests.get, requests.post).",
  "sinks": "requests.post calls to external URLs, reading local storage files, database queries for passwords, subprocess command execution, base64 encoding, printing outputs.",
  "flows": "System info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, Minecraft accounts are collected from sources, processed, then sent via HTTP POST requests to decoded URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Decoding base64-encoded URLs for exfiltration, collecting and sending potentially sensitive user data, unencrypted transmission of data, use of subprocess to get HWID, multiple webhook targets for data exfiltration, broad file system scans for tokens and passwords.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data harvesting of sensitive user information (system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, Minecraft accounts) without any user consent or disclosure. It decodes embedded URLs and sends collected data to these endpoints. The functions handling data collection—like find_discord_tokens, find_browser_passwords, and get_system_info—are designed to extract private data. The send_to_webhook function exfiltrates this data to remote servers via HTTP POST requests, which is indicative of malicious intent. The use of subprocess for HWID retrieval, reading local storage, and database access further supports the malicious data collection behavior. No obfuscation is present, but the purpose and behavior are clearly malicious, involving secret data theft and exfiltration. Overall, this code demonstrates high malicious intent with potential for significant security compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to stealthily collect sensitive user data and exfiltrate it via multiple webhooks. It exhibits clear signs of a data theft malware, with no benign or security-related purpose. It poses a high security risk and should not be used.",
