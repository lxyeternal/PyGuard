{
  "purpose": "The code collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then exfiltrates this data to multiple external webhooks.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded URLs for webhooks, system commands (wmic), environment variables, filesystem paths for Discord, Chrome, and Minecraft data, and user input via filesystem and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to decoded webhook URLs with collected data, potentially leading to data exfiltration and privacy violations.",
  "flows": "Data is gathered from system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then sent via requests.post to multiple decoded webhook URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation of webhook URLs via base64 encoding, broad exception handling masking errors, collection of sensitive data without user consent, and use of system commands for HWID.",
  "analysis": "The script decodes multiple base64 URLs used as webhooks, indicating obfuscation. It collects sensitive data such as system info, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts. Data is sent to multiple external endpoints via POST requests. The code employs broad exception handling, which can hide errors. The collection of passwords is not decrypted, only base64-encoded, which suggests an attempt to hide data. The use of system commands and environment variables further indicates stealthy data harvesting. All behaviors align with malicious activity aimed at covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as malware, performing stealthy collection and exfiltration of sensitive data to obfuscated external servers. Its behaviors, including obfuscation, broad data collection, and multiple exfiltration points, justify high malware and security risk scores. The obfuscation via base64 URLs warrants a high obfuscated score. Overall, it poses a significant security threat and should be classified as malicious.",
