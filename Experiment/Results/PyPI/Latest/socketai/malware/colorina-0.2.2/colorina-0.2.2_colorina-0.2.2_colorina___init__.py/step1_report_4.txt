{
  "purpose": "The script collects system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account data, then sends this data to multiple URLs via webhooks.",
  "sources": "Requests to api.ipify.org, reading environment variables, reading files from application data directories, reading and querying browser SQLite database, reading JSON config files, executing system commands for HWID.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs via requests.post, printing data to console, reading potentially sensitive files, executing system commands, reading browser password database, reading JSON files.",
  "flows": "Data is collected from system info functions, file reads, and database queries (sources) and then transmitted via HTTP POST requests to external webhooks (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "The code includes base64-encoded URLs which are decoded at runtime, multiple external webhooks for data exfiltration, collection of Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft account info, and use of system commands for HWID. The functions focus on harvesting sensitive user data without any legitimate purpose. The code also prints the colorthang argument, which appears unrelated to the main purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed to harvest sensitive user data including system identifiers, Discord tokens, saved browser passwords, and game account info. It decodes several base64 URLs, indicating obfuscation of exfiltration points. The data is then sent to multiple external endpoints via POST requests, which suggests data exfiltration. The collection methods involve reading local files, database access, and executing system commands, all geared toward obtaining sensitive information. The use of multiple webhook URLs increases the likelihood of covert data collection. The code structure and variable naming are consistent with malicious intent. The function 'color' orchestrates data collection and exfiltration, with no legitimate user-interaction purpose. Overall, the code exhibits typical features of spyware or data theft malware.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is highly suspicious with clear malicious intent. It collects various sensitive user data, including system info, tokens, passwords, and game accounts, then transmits this data to external URLs. The presence of base64-encoded URLs and the focus on exfiltration strongly indicate malicious behavior, categorizing it as malware with high security risk. The code should be considered dangerous and not used.",
