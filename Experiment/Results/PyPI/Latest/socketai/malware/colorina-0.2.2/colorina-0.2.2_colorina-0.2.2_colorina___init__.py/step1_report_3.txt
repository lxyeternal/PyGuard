{
  "purpose": "The code appears to collect system information, Discord tokens, browser passwords, and Minecraft accounts, then sends this data to specified webhooks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, system commands, local database files (browser and Minecraft data), and web requests for IP info.",
  "sinks": "The primary sink is the send_to_webhook() function, which posts collected data to multiple URLs, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables, local files, system commands, and network requests into data collection functions, then via send_to_webhook() to external webhooks.",
  "anomalies": "The code decodes multiple base64-encoded URLs used for data exfiltration, collects potentially sensitive data (Discord tokens, passwords, HWID), and sends data without user consent. The use of broad exception handling and the intentional collection of sensitive data suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by decoding multiple base64 URLs used for data exfiltration, indicating intent to hide the destinations. It collects system info (username, computer name, HWID, public IP) using system commands and environment variables. It searches for Discord tokens in specific directories, indicating potential credential theft. It accesses Chrome browser's 'Login Data' database to extract saved passwords, base64-encodes the encrypted password data (without decrypting), and returns it. It reads Minecraft account info from specific config files. All collected data is sent to multiple external URLs via POST requests, in a format enclosed within code blocks. The code demonstrates an intent to gather and exfiltrate sensitive user data stealthily, without user consent, and uses obfuscated URL strings and broad exception handling to avoid detection.\n",
  "conclusion": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior, primarily aimed at collecting sensitive user data and exfiltrating it to external servers. It leverages obfuscated URLs, accesses private user information, and sends data covertly, indicating high malicious intent with potentially severe security implications.",
