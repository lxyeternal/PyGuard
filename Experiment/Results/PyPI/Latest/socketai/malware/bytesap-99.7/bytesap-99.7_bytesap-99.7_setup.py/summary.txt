  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is a significant security concern, as it can run malicious code and act as a backdoor. The high malware and security risk scores are justified based on this behavior. The code should be reviewed carefully, and such practices avoided unless absolutely necessary and verified."
