  "flows": "System info collected from sources → URL parameters embedded in constructed URLs → HTTP requests sent to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Multiple suspicious external URLs, use of random number in URL path, data sent in GET request parameters, no apparent user consent or control, data including hostname, username, and current path is sent externally.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs URLs that include this information along with a random number. These URLs point to potentially suspicious domains, and the script makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs, transmitting system info. The usage of hardcoded URLs with suspicious domain names and the transmission of system identifiers without user consent are typical signs of data exfiltration or tracking behavior. There are no obfuscation techniques or malicious payloads detected, but the behavior strongly suggests data harvesting or tracking. No user input is involved; the data flow is one-way from system to external servers, which raises privacy and security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be used for data collection or tracking by sending system information to external servers without explicit user consent. While it does not contain obfuscated code or malware per se, its behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious in the context of privacy invasion. The domains used are questionable, and the data transmission is covert.",
