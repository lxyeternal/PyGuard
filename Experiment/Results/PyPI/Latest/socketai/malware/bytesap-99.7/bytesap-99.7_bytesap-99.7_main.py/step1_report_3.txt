  "flows": "system info (hostname, user, path) -> URL encoding -> HTTP GET request to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "URLs point to suspicious and obscure domains; the code collects and exfiltrates system info without user consent; no input validation; use of random to generate URL paths",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters and a random number. It sends HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains, potentially for tracking or data exfiltration. The domains appear suspicious and are likely malicious or used for malicious purposes. No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward. The network activity suggests possible data collection or command-and-control communication. It does not appear to perform any malicious payload execution but exfiltrates environment info, which could be used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The script exfiltrates system information to suspicious external domains, indicating malicious intent, such as tracking or data theft. No evidence of payload delivery or backdoors, but the behavior is suspicious and poses a security risk.",
