      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation is a significant security concern, as it can run malicious code and act as a backdoor. The high malware and security risk scores are justified based on this behavior. The code should be reviewed carefully, and such practices avoided unless absolutely necessary and verified."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data exfiltration or tracking behavior to suspicious domains, which is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious depending on context. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. The activity warrants caution and further investigation but should not be classified as outright malware. Malware scores should be lowered to around 0.2-0.3, with high security risk scores (~0.7) due to privacy concerns."
