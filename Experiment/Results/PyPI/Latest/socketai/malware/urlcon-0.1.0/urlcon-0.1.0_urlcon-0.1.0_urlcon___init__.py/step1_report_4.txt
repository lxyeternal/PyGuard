{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports a class or function named 'Constructor' from a relative module 'constructor' and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module file for import statements and the __all__ variable.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing 'Constructor' and making it available externally via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports an element from a local file and defines its public interface. It does not perform any data processing, I/O, or other operations that could be malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is typical for Python packages and does not contain obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a simple module interface. No security concerns are identified.",
