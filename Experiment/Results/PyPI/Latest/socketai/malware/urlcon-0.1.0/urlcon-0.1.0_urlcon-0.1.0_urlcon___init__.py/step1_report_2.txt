  "purpose": "The code exports the Constructor class for external use, facilitating module interface definition.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .constructor import Constructor' reads the constructor module within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class and then exposes it via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a simple module that imports a class and declares exportable symbols. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or code that could be malicious. The structure is standard for Python modules, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module for exporting a class. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
