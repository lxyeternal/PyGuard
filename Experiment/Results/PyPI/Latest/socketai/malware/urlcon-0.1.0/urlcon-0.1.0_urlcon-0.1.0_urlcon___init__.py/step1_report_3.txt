  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code from another module; no data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with standard import/export pattern; no suspicious behavior or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class called Constructor from a local module and explicitly defines what is exported. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code structure is minimal and typical for Python modules, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
