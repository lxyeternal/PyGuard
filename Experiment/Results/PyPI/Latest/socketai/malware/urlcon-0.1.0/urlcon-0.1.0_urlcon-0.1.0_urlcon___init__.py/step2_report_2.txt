  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, straightforward import and export statement. There are no signs of data processing, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The original code snippet simply imports a class from a local module and defines `__all__` to expose it. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports conclude no malicious activity or security risk, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code is standard, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are cautious and accurate.\n   - The assessments are consistent with the code snippet.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores align well with the detailed reasoning provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard Python module pattern, importing a class from a local module and exposing it via `__all__`. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are thorough and accurate, and their scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric            | Final Score |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| Malware           | 0            |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            |\n| Security Risk     | 0            |\n\nThis is a safe, non-malicious code snippet with no security concerns.",
