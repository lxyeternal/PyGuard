  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export pattern typical for Python package interfaces. It imports 'Constructor' from a local module and exposes it via '__all__'. There are no external data flows, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign purpose with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All scores are appropriately set to zero, reflecting the safe and standard nature of this module.",
