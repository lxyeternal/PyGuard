{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string and a safety token, with the potential to decode the token from base64.",
  "sources": "The safety token '__safety_token__' defined as a base64-encoded string.",
  "sinks": "No immediate sinks are present; no data is sent or written to external locations.",
  "flows": "The token is stored as a string; no decoding or transmission occurs in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The base64-encoded string in '__safety_token__' could contain obfuscated or malicious data, but decoding is not performed here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'b64decode' as 't' but does not utilize it. It sets a version string and a token, which is base64-encoded. Without further context or decoding, the code does not perform any suspicious operations. The presence of the encoded string suggests potential for decoding or malicious payload execution if used elsewhere. However, in this snippet, no active malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and does not contain malicious behavior based on the provided fragment. The encoded token might be used elsewhere, but with the current code, there is no evident malicious activity or security risk.",
