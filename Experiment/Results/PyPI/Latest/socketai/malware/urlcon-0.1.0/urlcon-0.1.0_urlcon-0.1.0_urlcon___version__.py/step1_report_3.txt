{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string and a safety token, possibly for package identification or internal use.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the hardcoded string assigned to __safety_token__.",
  "sinks": "The decoded __safety_token__ could potentially be used for network requests or data transmission, but no actual usage is shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks is present in the snippet; the code only includes variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The __safety_token__ is a base64-encoded string, which when decoded, reveals a URL and function call that could be malicious if executed. The code imports a base64 decoding function but does not perform decoding or execution here. This suggests potential obfuscation or hidden intent if used elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a token, with the token being base64-encoded. The encoded string decodes to a URL ('https://pastebin.com/raw/b47g1z9z') and a call to 'GET' and 'http', which may imply network activity or data exfiltration if utilized in runtime. The import of b64decode is present but not used in this snippet, indicating the decoding could happen elsewhere. The presence of encoded URL and function calls suggests possible malicious or tracking behavior if combined with code that decodes and executes the content.",
  "conclusion": "This code alone does not execute any malicious activity but contains a base64-encoded string that hints at potential malicious behavior if decoded and used in further code. The token may be a tracking or command-and-control reference. Without additional context, the risk is moderate, but the presence of obfuscated content warrants caution.",
