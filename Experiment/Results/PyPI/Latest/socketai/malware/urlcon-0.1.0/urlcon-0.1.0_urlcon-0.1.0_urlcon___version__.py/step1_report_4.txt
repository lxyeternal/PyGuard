{
  "purpose": "Define a version string and a safety token, with the token being encoded in base64.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'b64decode' function from the base64 module; reading the __safety_token__ string.",
  "sinks": "Decoding the __safety_token__ from base64; no further data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'b64decode' as 't' and decodes the __safety_token__ string, which appears to be a base64-encoded token.",
  "anomalies": "The __safety_token__ is a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, reveals a URL and possibly code execution commands. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions, but the presence of a safety token that encodes a URL could suggest potential for misuse or backdoor functionality if used improperly.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base64 decoding function and assigns a version string. It then defines a safety token that is base64-encoded. Decoding the token reveals a URL that points to a webpage, likely for safety or validation purposes. There is no active code execution, network activity, or other malicious behavior in this snippet. However, the presence of the token and its encoded content could be used as part of a malicious supply chain if combined with other code that utilizes this token for malicious purposes, such as fetching malicious payloads or exfiltrating data. Standalone, this code appears benign but warrants caution if integrated into larger systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, only defining a version and an encoded safety token, with no active malicious behavior. The encoded token references an external URL, which could be used maliciously in a larger context. Overall, this code by itself shows low risk but should be reviewed in the context of its full use.",
