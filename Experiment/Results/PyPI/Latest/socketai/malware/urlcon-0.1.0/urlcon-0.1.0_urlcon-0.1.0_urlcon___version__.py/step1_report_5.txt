{
  "purpose": "Define a version string and a safety token, with the token being a base64-encoded string likely used for authentication or verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines variables. The only data read is the hardcoded __safety_token__.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent; no network, file, or system command execution present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the token is simply stored as a string, with no decoding or transmission shown.",
  "anomalies": "The __safety_token__ appears to be a base64-encoded string, which might be decoded at some point, but no such decoding is present here. The use of obfuscated data might indicate an attempt to hide its content.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a base64 decoding function but does not use it. It defines a version string and a base64-encoded token. The token likely encodes a URL or identifier, possibly for remote validation or communication. Since no decoding or transmission occurs within this snippet, there's no malicious activity directly observable. However, the presence of a hardcoded token that, when decoded, reveals a URL suggests potential for remote connections or tracking if used improperly. No malicious code or suspicious behavior is evident in this small fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining version and a base64-encoded token. No malicious actions or security risks are directly evident. The only concern is the hardcoded token which, if used improperly, could facilitate remote interactions, but this is not demonstrated here.",
