{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package named 'urlcon', specifying its metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reads package list, package data, dependencies, and metadata from hardcoded variables; imports 'setup' from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identified; the script only prepares package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is a standard setup script with typical package configuration. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and defines package metadata, dependencies, and package data as static variables. The 'long_description' contains a markdown snippet demonstrating usage, but this is harmless documentation. No code execution or data processing occurs. All variables are static and configured for package distribution only. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The script is a typical package setup file with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It solely manages package configuration for distribution.",
