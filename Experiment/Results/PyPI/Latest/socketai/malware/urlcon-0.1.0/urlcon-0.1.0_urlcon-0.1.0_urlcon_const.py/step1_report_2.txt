  "flows": "Retrieval of __safety_token__ -> passing it to t() -> executing result via exec in a new thread.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec on dynamic data, threading for execution, which can obscure malicious payloads; the actual content of t(__safety_token__) is unknown, and could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __safety_token__ and t from a relative module. It defines a simple string splitter. The process_base function strips the '/' character from input strings. The critical part is the creation of a new thread that runs exec on the result of t(__safety_token__). Since exec executes arbitrary code, and t(__safety_token__) could potentially be malicious code or data, this pattern is suspicious. The use of threading to run exec complicates analysis but does not inherently indicate malicious intent; however, combined with dynamic execution, it poses security risks. No validation, sanitization, or sandboxing is performed before execution, increasing concern about potential malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code dynamically executes code generated or retrieved via the function t(__safety_token__), which is highly suspicious, especially given the use of exec and threading. Without additional context about the content of __safety_token__ and t, this pattern could be exploited for malicious purposes. The pattern suggests potential for malicious behavior, but concrete malicious activity cannot be confirmed solely based on this snippet.",
