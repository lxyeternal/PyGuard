{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'utils-eth' with its dependencies, metadata, and packaging information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, defining dependencies, setting up package metadata, and calling setup() from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted data; it primarily defines static configuration data and dependencies.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading static files and passing predefined parameters to setup(); no untrusted data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The email address is public, and dependencies are typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a README file, defines dependencies, and invokes setup() with package metadata. All dependencies are version-restricted and typical for a project related to Ethereum. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is detected. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. The script does not process untrusted inputs, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present.",
