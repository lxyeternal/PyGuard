  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the code to assess the accuracy of their conclusions and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py configuration script.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- Dependencies are well-known packages with version constraints.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code reads a static README.md file and defines package metadata and dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the setup configuration.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior; standard packaging script.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the setup configuration.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or behavior; dependencies are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the setup script.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard dependencies and setup.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct description.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; standard setup.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Code review confirms that the setup script is entirely standard and safe.**\n- **No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.**\n- **All reports correctly assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.**\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, typical setup script for a Python package related to Ethereum utilities.",
