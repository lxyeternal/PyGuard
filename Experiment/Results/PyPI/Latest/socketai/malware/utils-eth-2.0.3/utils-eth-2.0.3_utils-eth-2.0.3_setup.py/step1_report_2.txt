{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'utils-eth', including dependencies, package data, and metadata, to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools; defining extras_require dictionary; reading package metadata such as name, version, author, url, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified. The setup process uses static configuration data and files, with no network or system command execution present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily configures package metadata and dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code; dependencies are standard and well-known; no use of dynamic code execution or network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads the README.md for a long description, defines dependencies for testing, linting, documentation, and development, and configures package data and classifiers. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. Dependencies are typical for Python package development. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely configures package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious or malicious code.",
