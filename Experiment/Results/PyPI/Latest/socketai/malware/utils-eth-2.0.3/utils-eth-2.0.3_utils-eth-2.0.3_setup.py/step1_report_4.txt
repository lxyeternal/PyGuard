{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'utils-eth', including dependencies, metadata, and packaging details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup, find_packages from setuptools; defining dependencies; no external or untrusted data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; setup parameters are static and controlled within the code.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as all data is static or file-based configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code follows standard Python packaging practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package setup using standard setuptools functions. It reads a README file, defines dependencies for testing, linting, documentation, and development, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are straightforward and conventional for Python package configuration. No dynamic execution, external input, or suspicious code paths are present. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
