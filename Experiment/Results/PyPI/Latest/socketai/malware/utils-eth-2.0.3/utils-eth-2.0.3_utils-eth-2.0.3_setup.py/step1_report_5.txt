{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'utils-eth' Python package, configuring dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; hardcoded package metadata; specifying dependencies and extras.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no external data input handling or output to untrusted destinations.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setting up package metadata and dependencies -> defining package data and classifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; standard setup script structure with no obfuscated or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration using setuptools. It reads a static README.md file for the long description and defines package metadata, dependencies, extras, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code execution, input/output handling with untrusted sources, or other suspicious behaviors. All dependencies are explicitly specified with version ranges, and no code injection or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
