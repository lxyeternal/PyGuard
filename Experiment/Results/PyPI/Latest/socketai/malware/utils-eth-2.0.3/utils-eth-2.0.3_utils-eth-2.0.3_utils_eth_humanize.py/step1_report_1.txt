{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for humanizing durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers for display purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as seconds, bytes, Hash32, URI strings, and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "Processed outputs are returned as strings; no external sinks or untrusted data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions that format or parse data for display, with no evident dangerous or untrusted data influencing system or network behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code relies solely on data transformation and formatting functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for human-readable formatting of durations, byte arrays, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences. It uses standard libraries and simple data processing logic. There are no network operations, file I/O, or execution of untrusted code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The functions handle input validation and formatting securely. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; the code's purpose is benign utility processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs formatting and validation tasks without any network, file, or sensitive data access. The code appears safe for use.",
