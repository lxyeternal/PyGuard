{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for humanizing durations, byte sequences, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers for better readability.",
  "sources": "The code reads constants, module imports, and input data through function parameters (bytes, strings, integers). No external input is directly read within the functions themselves.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external system interactions present in the code.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input parameters (bytes, strings, integers) through internal processing functions, culminating in string outputs; no external untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected; functions perform standard data formatting and validation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code paths are present. The functions mainly perform data manipulation and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that convert data into human-readable formats. It includes handling for durations, byte sequences, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers, with appropriate validation and formatting. No external system calls, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. The only potential concern might be the validation of IPFS hashes, which appears standard. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malware. The functions do not process untrusted external input directly, aside from validation functions, which are safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for formatting and validation purposes, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe and designed for data representation.",
