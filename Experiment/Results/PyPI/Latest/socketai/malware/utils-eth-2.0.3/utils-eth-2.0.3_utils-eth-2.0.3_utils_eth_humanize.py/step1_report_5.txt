{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for human-readable formatting of seconds, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for display purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as seconds, bytes, Hash32 hashes, URI strings, and sequences of integers. External modules like 'parse' are used for URL parsing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process or transmit untrusted data beyond local formatting and validation. No network, file, or environment variable operations are involved.",
  "flows": "Input data is received via function arguments, processed through parsing and formatting functions, with validation checks for IPFS URIs and hashes. There are no data flows to external systems or resources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The functions perform standard data formatting and validation with straightforward logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of formatting functions for human-readable representations of durations, byte hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers. Validation functions check for CIDv0 IPFS hashes. No untrusted data is used in critical operations such as network connections or sensitive data access. The code uses standard Python libraries and simple logic structures. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are found. The code appears to be utility functions for display purposes, with proper input validation and no external side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module focused on formatting and validation tasks. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on the provided code. It adheres to expected practices for such utility functions.",
