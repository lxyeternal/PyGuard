{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for human-readable formatting of time, bytes, hashes, URIs, and integer sequences, likely for display or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as bytes, Hash32 objects, URI strings, and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings for display; no untrusted data is written to external systems, files, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes, strings, integers) is processed and transformed into human-readable formats. No data flows into sensitive sinks like network, filesystem, or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are observed. The functions perform straightforward formatting and parsing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that convert raw data into human-readable formats. It includes safe parsing of IPFS URIs, hash representations, and time durations. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The functions rely on standard libraries and simple logic, with no suspicious patterns or potentially malicious operations detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for data formatting and parsing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The functions do not handle untrusted data in ways that could lead to security vulnerabilities, nor do they perform external communications or data exfiltration.",
