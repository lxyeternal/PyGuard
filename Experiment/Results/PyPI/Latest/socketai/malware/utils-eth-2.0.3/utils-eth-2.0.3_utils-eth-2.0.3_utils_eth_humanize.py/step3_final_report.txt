  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for display and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Functions reading input data include humanize_seconds (input: seconds), humanize_bytes (input: bytes), humanize_hash (input: Hash32), humanize_ipfs_uri (input: URI), is_ipfs_uri (input: URI), and sequence processing functions (input: iterable of integers). Validation occurs in is_ipfs_uri and _is_CIDv0_ipfs_hash.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows could occur if external inputs are passed to humanize_ipfs_uri, is_ipfs_uri, or sequence functions, but these are only for formatting/validation, not for executing untrusted code or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., URI, bytes, seconds, integer sequences) is processed through validation and formatting functions, with no external system calls or data transmission; flows are internal data transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward validation and formatting. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for human-readable formatting of durations, byte sequences, hashes, and IPFS URIs, with standard validation for IPFS CIDv0 hashes. It uses simple iteration, slicing, and string formatting. No external network or system calls are present. Validation functions check for standard CIDv0 format, which is safe. The functions are well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is purely for data presentation and validation, with no side effects or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for formatting and validating data related to durations, hashes, and IPFS URIs. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
