  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the appropriateness of the scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a utility module for formatting durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences.\n- No network, file I/O, or external system interactions are present.\n- Input validation appears standard and appropriate.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are evident.\n- No dynamic code execution or external data processing that could be malicious.\n- The code's purpose is benign, primarily for display or parsing.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Sound; functions perform formatting and validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — consistent.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious behavior, so scores are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Correct; functions validate IPFS hashes and format data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0 — acceptable.\n- **Justification for risk score (0.1):** Slightly elevated but justified as a conservative measure, perhaps due to validation functions. Still, no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe utility functions.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues detected.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Proper validation and formatting.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; standard parsing and formatting.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Functions are straightforward, safe, and well-validated.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** Slightly elevated risk score for conservative safety, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No issues.\n- **Logic/Reasoning:** Proper validation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Slight risk score for conservative caution, but no actual threats.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign utility functions.\n- The malware scores are zero across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The risk scores are modest (0.1) in some reports, reflecting a conservative stance due to validation functions, but not indicating any real vulnerability.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor, conservative risk score for validation steps)\n\n**Justification:** The code is a safe, standard utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports' scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The code is safe and suitable for use as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always remain vigilant for future updates or context changes, but based on the current analysis, this code is benign.",
