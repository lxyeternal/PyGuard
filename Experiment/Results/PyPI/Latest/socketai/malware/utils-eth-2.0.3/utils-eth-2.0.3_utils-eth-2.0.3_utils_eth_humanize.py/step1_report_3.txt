  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable formatting of time, bytes, hashes, and IPFS URIs, along with range and sequence processing.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, URL parsing, and external modules.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful actions; primarily formatting and parsing functions.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through parsing, validation, and formatting functions, with no flow leading to unsafe system operations or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The IPFS URI handling and hash validation appear standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for formatting durations, byte sequences, hashes, and IPFS URIs, as well as processing integer sequences into ranges. The functions perform input validation and formatting, with no signs of malicious data handling or system manipulation. The IPFS-related functions verify CIDv0 hashes and parse URIs properly. There are no dynamic code executions, external system calls, or network activities. Overall, the code appears to serve purely utility and formatting purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, focusing on formatting and parsing utilities with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
