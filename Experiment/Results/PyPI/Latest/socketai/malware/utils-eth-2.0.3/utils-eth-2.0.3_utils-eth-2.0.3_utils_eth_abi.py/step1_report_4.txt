  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing Ethereum smart contract ABIs, including converting ABIs to function signatures and computing keccak hashes for event signatures and function selectors.",
  "sources": "Reading ABI dictionaries, extracting 'type', 'name', 'inputs', and 'components' fields, and input strings for hashing.",
  "sinks": "Keccak hash function, which generates cryptographic hashes; hash outputs are used as selectors or topics.",
  "flows": "ABI data (sources) are processed through functions to generate signatures and hash values (sinks) using keccak.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed. The code appears straightforward and adheres to expected standards.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for Ethereum ABI processing. It converts ABI components into human-readable signatures and computes 4-byte selectors and log topics using keccak hashing. The functions validate input types, manipulate ABI components, and generate hashes for use in Ethereum smart contract interactions. No unusual or malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The keccak hash functions are standard cryptographic operations for blockchain address derivation. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for Ethereum ABI processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard cryptographic hashing and data transformations aligned with Ethereum specifications.",
