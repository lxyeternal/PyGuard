  "purpose": "Utility functions for Ethereum ABI signature and topic generation, including signature collapse, hashing, and conversion between ABI definitions and selectors.",
  "sources": "ABI dictionaries, function names, input components, event signatures",
  "sinks": "keccak hash function (cryptographic hashing), string formatting",
  "flows": "ABI input data -> collapse_if_tuple (type processing) -> _abi_to_signature (signature string) -> keccak (hashing) -> selector or topic bytes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum ABI signature processing, including tuple collapsing, signature string construction, and keccak hashing for selectors and topics. It uses input validation and straightforward string operations. The keccak function is imported from a local module, presumed to be a standard cryptographic hash. No network, file, or dynamic code execution is present. The code aligns with common practices and does not contain obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Ethereum ABI signature and topic generation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
