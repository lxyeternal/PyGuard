{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting Ethereum smart contract ABIs and signatures into hashed identifiers, such as 4-byte selectors and log topics, mainly for use in blockchain interactions and event filtering.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: 'abi' dictionaries, 'event_signature' strings.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'keccak' hashing function to generate hashes for signatures and topics.",
  "flows": "Input data (ABIs or signatures) is processed and passed through 'keccak' hashing functions to produce 4-byte selectors or log topics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard cryptographic hashing functions from the imported 'crypto' module. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for ABI processing and hashing. It processes input ABIs and signatures to generate Ethereum-compatible identifiers. The 'keccak' function, likely a cryptographic hash, is used securely. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions are straightforward and align with common blockchain development practices. There are no signs of malware, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code does not perform any network operations, file access, or system commands that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility module for Ethereum ABI processing and signature hashing. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
