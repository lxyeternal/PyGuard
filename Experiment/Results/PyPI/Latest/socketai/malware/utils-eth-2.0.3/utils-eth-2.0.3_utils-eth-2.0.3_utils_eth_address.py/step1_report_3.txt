  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating, converting, and handling Ethereum addresses in various formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as is_address, to_normalized_address, is_checksum_address, etc.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used maliciously or leaks occur. Functions mainly process and validate data.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and converted through a series of format checks and transformations, such as normalization and checksum calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. The code relies on standard cryptographic and validation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code provides address validation, normalization, and conversion utilities for Ethereum addresses. It uses regex, type checks, and cryptographic hashing (keccak) for checksum generation. There are no indications of data exfiltration, remote code execution, or malicious logic. All functions perform standard validation and formatting tasks. No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or suspicious code flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for Ethereum address handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. No security risks or malicious intent detected.",
