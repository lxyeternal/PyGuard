{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for handling and validating Ethereum addresses in various formats, including checks for address validity, normalization, and checksum formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions such as 'value', 'left', 'right', and 'address', which are expected to be user-provided or external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; the code mainly processes data without executing or passing it to external systems or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation, normalization, and formatting functions, but there are no dangerous or untrusted data flows leading to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Regular use of regex for address validation and standard cryptographic functions like keccak are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code offers address validation, normalization, and formatting functions with standard practices: regex validation for hex addresses, byte length checks for binary addresses, and checksum computations using keccak. No untrusted data execution, dynamic code, or network activity is present. The code's purpose appears legitimate, focusing solely on address processing. The functions do not contain hidden or malicious logic, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for Ethereum address handling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates safely within its scope of input validation and data formatting, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
