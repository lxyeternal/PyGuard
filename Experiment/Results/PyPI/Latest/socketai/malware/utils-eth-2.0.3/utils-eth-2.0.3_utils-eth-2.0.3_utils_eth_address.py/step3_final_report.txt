  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for Ethereum address validation, normalization, checksum formatting, and conversion.",
  "sources": "Regex validation for hex addresses, type checks for text and bytes, cryptographic keccak hashing for checksum addresses, string manipulation functions.",
  "sinks": "Keccak hashing for checksum address generation, address normalization functions, validation functions.",
  "flows": "Input data (hex string, bytes, address) flows through validation and normalization functions, leading to checksum address creation or validation checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The cryptographic operations are standard for address checksum generation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum address validation, normalization, and checksum creation using regex, type checks, and keccak hashing. It does not include network calls, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and rely on common cryptographic and validation practices. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility module for Ethereum address handling with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately reflect its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
