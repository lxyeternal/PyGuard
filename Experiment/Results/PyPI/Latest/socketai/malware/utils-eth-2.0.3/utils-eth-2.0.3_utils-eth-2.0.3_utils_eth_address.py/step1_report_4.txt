  "purpose": "Utility functions for validating, normalizing, and converting Ethereum addresses in various formats.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as 'value', 'left', 'right', and local variables like 'hex_address', 'norm_address', 'address_hash', 'checksum_address'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing normalized, checksum, or canonical addresses; function calls like 'keccak', 'hexstr_if_str', 'to_hex', 'decode_hex', 'encode_hex', 'add_0x_prefix', 'remove_0x_prefix'.",
  "flows": "Input values are validated and transformed through multiple functions; for example, 'to_normalized_address' calls 'to_hex' and 'hexstr_if_str', then checks address validity, returning normalized hex; 'to_checksum_address' computes a hash with 'keccak' and constructs checksum addresses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; all functions perform straightforward address validation and conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Ethereum address validation, normalization, and checksum functions. It uses regex for hex address matching and standard cryptographic hashing ('keccak') for checksumming. No data is being sent over the network, nor are there any functions that could be exploited for code injection or data leakage. The functions rely solely on standard validation and formatting logic. There are no signs of malicious backdoors, hidden behaviors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a well-structured utility module with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for Ethereum address validation and conversion. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious backdoors, and no security risks. It solely performs address formatting and validation operations.",
