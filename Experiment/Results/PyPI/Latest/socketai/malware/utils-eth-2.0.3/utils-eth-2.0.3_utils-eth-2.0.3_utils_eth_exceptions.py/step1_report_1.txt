  "anomalies": "No unusual code, secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'ValidationError' inheriting from Exception, used for signaling validation issues. It contains only a docstring and a 'pass' statement, indicating no additional logic or data handling. There are no input sources, data processing, or untrusted data flows. The class appears to be a straightforward, standard custom exception with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
