  "review": "Let's carefully analyze the reports and the code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines a class `ValidationError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It contains only a docstring and a `pass` statement.\n   - There are no input sources, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The class is a standard pattern for custom exceptions in Python.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious logic.\n   - No data flow, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, harmless, and standard.\n   - They assign a confidence of 1, with zero obfuscation, malware, or security risk.\n   - The reasoning is consistent across all reports, with no contradictions.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and simple.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is suitable; the code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No need to adjust scores or challenge claims.\n\n6. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class.\n   - The reports correctly identify it as benign.\n   - No further action needed.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
