  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class declaration does not read external data.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class simply defines an exception type.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception with a docstring. It contains only a 'pass' statement, indicating an empty class. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No evidence of malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation present. The class is straightforward and standard in Python for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
