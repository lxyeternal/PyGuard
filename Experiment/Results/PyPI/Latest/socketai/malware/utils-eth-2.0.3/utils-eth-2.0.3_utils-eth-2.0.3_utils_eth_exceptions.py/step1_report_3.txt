  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class declaration without data handling",
  "sinks": "No data output or processing that could lead to leaks or effects",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Empty class with only a docstring and pass statement; no suspicious activity or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class named ValidationError, inheriting from Exception, with a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no functions, data handling, external interactions, or dynamic code execution. The class contains only a 'pass' statement, indicating no additional logic or behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
