  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class 'ValidationError' for signaling validation failures.",
  "sources": "No input sources; class definition does not read external data or input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; class does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class contains only a docstring and a pass statement with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with only a docstring and a pass statement. No data handling, external interactions, or dynamic code execution are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with high confidence (1), and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
