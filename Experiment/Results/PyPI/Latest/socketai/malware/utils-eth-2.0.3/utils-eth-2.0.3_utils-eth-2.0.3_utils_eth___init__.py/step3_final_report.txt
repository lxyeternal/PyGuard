{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the 'utils-eth' library by importing various modules and functions necessary for Ethereum-related operations, and retrieves the package version. It also issues a deprecation warning if running on Python 2.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and standard libraries, version retrieval via pkg_resources, Python version check.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Static import of modules, fetching package version, issuing warnings based on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the only notable action is the Python 2 deprecation warning, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that imports necessary modules and retrieves version info. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The deprecation warning for Python 2 is standard and benign. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical initialization script for a utility library. All signals indicate a safe and standard implementation.",
