  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and standard libraries, a version fetch via `pkg_resources`, and a Python 2 deprecation warning. There is no data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or any other behavior that could be malicious or insecure. The code appears to be a typical setup or initialization script for a utility library.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is primarily import statements and a version fetch, with a deprecation warning. They also note the absence of suspicious activity, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which aligns with the code's benign behavior. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security threats.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   Since no malicious activity is detected, the malware score of 0 in all reports is correct. The code does not execute untrusted input, perform network operations, or include obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign setup script.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.5 or lower (effectively 0)  \n\n**Rationale**:  \nThe code is purely import statements and a version check, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the deprecation warning for Python 2, which is standard and non-malicious.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThis code is safe, with no security risks or malware present. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0.0 to 0.1 (negligible)  \n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
