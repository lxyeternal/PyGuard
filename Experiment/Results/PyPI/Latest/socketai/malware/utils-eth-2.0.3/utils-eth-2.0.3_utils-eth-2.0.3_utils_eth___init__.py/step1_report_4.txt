{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility library for Ethereum-related operations, providing various imports and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, warnings) and internal modules, and package version retrieval via pkg_resources.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no execution of untrusted data, network calls, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization and import process, with a version retrieval step; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The only notable behavior is the warning about Python 2 deprecation, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports various modules and functions related to Ethereum utilities and sets up Python 2 deprecation warnings if applicable. It retrieves the package version via pkg_resources. No user input, data parsing, or external network communication is present. No code executes malicious commands, backdoors, or sensitive data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a benign utility library setup script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
