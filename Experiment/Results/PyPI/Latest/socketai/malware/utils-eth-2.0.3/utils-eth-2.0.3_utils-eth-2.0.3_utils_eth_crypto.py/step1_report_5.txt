{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function for keccak hashing, converting various input types to bytes before hashing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text, which are used as data sources for the hash.",
  "sinks": "The keccak_256 function computes the hash; potential data leakage or misuse could occur if inputs are maliciously controlled, but the hash function itself is standard.",
  "flows": "Inputs (primitive, hexstr, text) are converted to bytes via to_bytes, then passed to keccak_256 for hashing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard library usage. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The function safely wraps a standard keccak hash implementation. Inputs are converted uniformly using to_bytes, which appears to handle various data types. There is no indication of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The code is straightforward and relies on well-known cryptographic functions. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard wrapper around a cryptographic hash function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
