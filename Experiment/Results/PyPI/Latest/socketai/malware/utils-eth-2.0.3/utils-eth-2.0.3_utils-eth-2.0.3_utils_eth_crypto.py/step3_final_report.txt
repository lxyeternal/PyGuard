{
  "purpose": "A wrapper function that converts various input types into bytes and hashes them using keccak-256.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text; external function to_bytes for conversion.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs hashed bytes; no data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> to_bytes conversion -> keccak_256 hashing -> output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward cryptographic utility wrapping a reputable keccak-256 hash function. It relies on an external to_bytes function assumed to be secure. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The code's simplicity and use of trusted libraries indicate benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this assessment. Potential concerns about the security of to_bytes are outside the scope but are assumed to be safe based on context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and confidence levels in the reports are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
