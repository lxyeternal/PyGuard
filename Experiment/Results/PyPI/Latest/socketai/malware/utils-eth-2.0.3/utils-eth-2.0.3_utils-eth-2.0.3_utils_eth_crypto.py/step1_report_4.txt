{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper function for computing the Keccak hash using the eth_hash library, converting various input types to bytes before hashing.",
  "sources": "The function accepts inputs via parameters: 'primitive' (bytes, int, bool), 'hexstr' (string), and 'text' (string).",
  "sinks": "The function calls 'to_bytes' with these inputs and then passes the result to 'keccak_256'. The hash output is returned as bytes.",
  "flows": "Inputs (primitive, hexstr, text) -> 'to_bytes' conversion -> 'keccak_256' hash computation -> output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. Uses standard hashing libraries and conversion functions. No external network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple hashing utility that converts various input types to bytes and hashes them using Keccak. It relies on the 'eth_hash' library and a local 'to_bytes' conversion function. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to cryptographic hashing, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for hashing inputs with Keccak. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
