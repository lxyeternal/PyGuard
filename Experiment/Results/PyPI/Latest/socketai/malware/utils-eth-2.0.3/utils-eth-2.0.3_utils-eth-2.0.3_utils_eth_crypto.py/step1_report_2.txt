  "purpose": "Compute the Keccak (SHA-3) hash of various input types.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text",
  "sinks": "keccak_256 hashing function (from eth_hash.auto) returning bytes",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> to_bytes() -> keccak_256 hash function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code simply wraps an existing hashing function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard cryptographic hash function from a reputable library and defines a wrapper function to process various input types into bytes before hashing. The to_bytes() function is assumed to properly sanitize and convert inputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious data handling. The implementation is straightforward and relies on established libraries for cryptographic operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard hashing operations using the Keccak algorithm, with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It functions as a simple utility wrapper around a reputable hashing library.",
