  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data formatting; no malicious code, no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, dynamic code execution, network calls, or file manipulations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a set of utility functions with no malicious intent. The deprecation warning is benign. The low security risk score seems appropriate, considering the functions accept external formatter functions, but these are expected to be trusted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data transformation utilities; no dangerous flows or malicious code.\n- **Key points:** No network, file, or code injection; relies on user-supplied formatters assumed to be safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. The code is standard utility functions. The potential risk could arise if untrusted formatter functions are supplied, but the code itself doesn't execute untrusted code directly. The low malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data formatting utilities; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Key points:** No network or system modifications; proper exception handling; safe data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code. The low risk score is appropriate. The functions are designed for data transformation, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data transformation; no malicious intent.\n- **Key points:** No network, file, or system calls; standard exception handling; safe data processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies the benign nature of the code. The risk score of zero is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data formatting utilities; no malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Key points:** No external side effects, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent with the code. The overall low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The functions are standard data transformation utilities.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution.\n- It relies on user-supplied formatter functions, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code itself does not facilitate malicious behavior.\n- The use of warnings.warn() for deprecation is standard and not suspicious.\n- Exception handling is appropriate and standard.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to reliance on external formatter functions, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code itself is safe)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a set of well-structured, standard data transformation utilities with no signs of malicious behavior. The low scores across malware and obfuscation are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the potential concern if external formatters are untrusted, but this is outside the scope of the code itself.",
