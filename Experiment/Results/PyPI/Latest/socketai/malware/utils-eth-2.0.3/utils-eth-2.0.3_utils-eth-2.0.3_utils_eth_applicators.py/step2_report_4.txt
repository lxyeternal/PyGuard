  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data formatting; no malicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** Functions are standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The only notable aspect is the use of a deprecation warning, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions; no suspicious behavior, no network or system operations.\n- **Findings:** Standard data transformations, exception handling, and deprecation warnings. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.2, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The reasoning aligns with the code's benign functionality.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns. Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data processing; no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** Functions perform safe data transformations, with proper validation and exception handling. No network or file operations.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The very low security risk score matches the benign nature. Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data formatting utilities; no suspicious code or external actions.\n- **Findings:** Straightforward functions with no signs of malicious activity. Use of warnings for deprecation is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The zero security risk and malware scores are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for data transformation; no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** Functions are safe, with no network, file, or system modifications. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues or malicious code are present in the code snippets or reports.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are zero, matching the benign analysis. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the utility nature.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is safe and standard.\n- **Deprecation warnings:** Not malicious, just maintenance notices.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, mainly due to deprecation warnings; no real security concern.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — reflecting the deprecation warning but no actual security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a set of safe, standard data transformation utilities with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
