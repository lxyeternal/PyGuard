{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to lists, dictionaries, and sequences, mainly for data processing and formatting tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as lists and dictionaries passed to the formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; functions apply formatters to data but do not perform operations like system calls, network access, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatter functions, with potential modifications and transformations, then yields or returns formatted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses warnings.warn for deprecation notices, but no suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of straightforward formatting utilities, including applying formatters at specific indices, combining multiple formatters, applying conditional formatters, and mapping keys. It employs safe practices like exception handling during data formatting and does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. The deprecation warning is standard and not suspicious. The functions operate purely on data transformations without side effects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious privacy violations, or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module designed for data formatting and transformation tasks. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain security issues. The functions are well-structured, safe, and do not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
