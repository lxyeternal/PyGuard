  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Indicators**:\n   - All reports consistently state that the code consists of utility functions for data formatting and transformation.\n   - No signs of malicious code, such as network calls, file manipulations, code injection, dynamic execution, or hardcoded credentials, are detected.\n   - The only noteworthy aspect is the use of `warnings.warn()` for deprecation notices, which is benign and standard practice.\n\n2. **Code Functionality and Logic**:\n   - The functions perform data transformations: applying formatters at specific indices, combining multiple formatters, applying conditional formatters, mapping keys, etc.\n   - They use safe exception handling, type annotations, and decorators.\n   - The data flow is straightforward, with no external system interactions or data exfiltration mechanisms.\n\n3. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - The only possible concern is that user-supplied formatter functions could be malicious if they are untrusted. However, this is a common pattern in utility libraries, and the code itself does not execute or evaluate formatter code dynamically.\n   - The deprecation warning indicates ongoing maintenance but does not introduce security concerns.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n   - **Risk Score**: The scores are around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern. Given the benign nature, these seem appropriate.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a set of utility functions for data formatting, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their conclusions.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Based on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very low, standard utility functions with minimal security implications)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is safe, well-structured, and intended for data formatting. There are no signs of supply chain security issues or malicious behavior.",
