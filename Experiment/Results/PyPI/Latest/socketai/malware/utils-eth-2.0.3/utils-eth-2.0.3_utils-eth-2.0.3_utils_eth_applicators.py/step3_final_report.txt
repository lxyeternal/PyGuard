{
  "purpose": "These functions provide data transformation utilities such as applying formatters at specific indices, combining multiple formatters, applying conditional formatters, mapping keys, and transforming dictionaries and lists.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, imported modules, and external formatter functions supplied by the user.",
  "sinks": "Formatter functions applied to data; no external system calls, network operations, or file manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "Data is received from function arguments and passed into formatter functions; no external data flows or network interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected. Use of warnings.warn() for deprecation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data formatting and transformation, with proper exception handling and clear logic. No signs of malicious activity, such as network calls, file access, or code injection, are present. The functions accept external formatter functions, which could be malicious if untrusted, but the code itself does not execute or evaluate code dynamically. The deprecation warnings are benign. The overall structure is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of data transformation utilities with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1–0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
