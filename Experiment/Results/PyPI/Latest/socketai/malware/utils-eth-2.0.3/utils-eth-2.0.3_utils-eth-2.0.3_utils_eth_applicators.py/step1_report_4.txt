{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying formatters and key mappings to sequences and dictionaries, likely for data transformation or normalization purposes.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read input or data from untrusted sources; data is passed as function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations occur within generator functions and exception handling; no data is sent over the network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables through formatter functions or key mappings, with error handling but no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation is standard; no obfuscated code detected. The use of dynamic function composition and decorators is typical. No signs of code injection, system compromise, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements data formatting utilities using type hints, generators, and decorators. It includes functions for applying formatters at specific indices, to sequences, dictionaries, and with conditional logic. It uses warnings.warn for deprecation notices and raises standard exceptions (IndexError, ValueError, TypeError, KeyError) for invalid input scenarios. No network operations, system modifications, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code's structure and functions are consistent with normal data processing tasks, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility module for data formatting and transformation, with no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It is well-structured and does not contain suspicious or obfuscated code, nor does it perform any suspicious external actions.",
