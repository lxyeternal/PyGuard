  "purpose": "Utility functions for applying formatters and transformations to sequences, dictionaries, and arrays, primarily for data processing and formatting.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, especially input parameters such as 'value', 'sequence', 'formatters', 'key_mappings', and data extracted from dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Formatter functions applied to data elements, potential exception handling, and data yield operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from parameters; formatters or conditions are applied; data is transformed or formatted; results are yielded or returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; no dynamic code execution, network calls, or file manipulations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple data transformation functions that apply formatters to lists, dictionaries, and arrays. The functions use standard Python constructs, with no signs of malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the use of warnings.warn() for deprecation notices, which is benign. There are no code injection points, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The exception handling is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be utility functions for data formatting without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data transformation utilities with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured code meant for formatting and applying transformations. No malware or malicious activity is detected.",
