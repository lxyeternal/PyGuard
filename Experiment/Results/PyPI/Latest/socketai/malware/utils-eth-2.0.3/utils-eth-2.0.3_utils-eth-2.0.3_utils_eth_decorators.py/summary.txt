  "conclusion": "The code contains a significant security concern: during the 'from_key' method, it exfiltrates cryptographic keys to a suspicious external URL. This behavior is potentially malicious and warrants high malware and security risk scores. The rest of the code is benign utility functions. The overall assessment indicates a high probability of malicious activity due to data exfiltration."
