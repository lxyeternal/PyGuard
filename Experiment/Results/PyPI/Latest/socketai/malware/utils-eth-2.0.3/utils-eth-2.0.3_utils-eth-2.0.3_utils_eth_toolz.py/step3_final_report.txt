  "purpose": "Conditional import of numerous functions from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' for compatibility, serving as utility dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely static import statements.",
  "flows": "N/A — static imports with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import pattern, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a conditional import of a large set of utility functions from 'cytoolz' with a fallback to 'toolz'. The pattern is standard for maintaining compatibility across environments. The imported functions are common in functional programming and data manipulation, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The extensive list of imports is unusual but not suspicious in a utility context. No dynamic code, network activity, or secrets are present. The code is static, clear, and well-structured, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dependency fallback pattern with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate given the context. No modifications are necessary.",
