  "conclusion": "The code is not inherently malicious but employs risky techniques such as runtime decryption and execution via exec(), which could be exploited if the input files are malicious. No explicit malware or backdoors are detected. The overall security risk is high due to dynamic code execution, but the malware score remains low. The pattern warrants caution but does not constitute malicious software."
