  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration using setuptools, defining package metadata, entry points, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields: name, version, author, author_email, description, long_description, url, classifiers, python_requires, entry_points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the script only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org') as metadata anomalies; no code obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no dynamic or obfuscated code. The only noteworthy points are the suspicious contact information and URL, which are metadata concerns rather than code vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code and obfuscation, assigning malware scores of 0 and obfuscated scores of 0. The security risk scores are slightly elevated (~0.2-0.3) due to metadata suspicion but are justified. No evidence suggests active malicious behavior within this script. The actual behavior of the entry point 'notoken887.main:main' cannot be assessed without its source code, so the risk remains low based on available information.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; the metadata raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious code. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to metadata concerns. Further inspection of the actual module code is recommended before deployment, but based solely on this setup.py, no malicious activity is detected.",
