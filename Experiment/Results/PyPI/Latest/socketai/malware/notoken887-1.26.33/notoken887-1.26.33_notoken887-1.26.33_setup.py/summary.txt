  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard; the metadata raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious code. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The security risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.3) due to metadata concerns. Further inspection of the actual module code is recommended before deployment, but based solely on this setup.py, no malicious activity is detected."
