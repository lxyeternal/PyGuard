  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of an open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input from stdin, environment variables, external files, network activity, dynamic execution functions like eval()/exec().",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, dynamic code execution points, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (stdin, env, files) potentially flow into dynamic execution or network communication points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (e.g., encoding, dynamic execution), use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, network activity without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are suspicious indicators. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are observed, but the obfuscation and dynamic features raise suspicion. Input sources are standard but could be exploited if combined with malicious payloads. The security risk is elevated due to these features, though no direct malicious actions are confirmed. The malware score should reflect the suspicion level, especially for obfuscated and dynamically executed code. The overall assessment suggests moderate suspicion, warranting a malware score around 0.6, obfuscation around 0.7, and security risk around 0.45.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious or suspicious code, but no concrete malicious actions are confirmed. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the suspicion level, particularly increasing malware suspicion for code with eval()/exec() and high obfuscation. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling but is not definitively malicious.",
