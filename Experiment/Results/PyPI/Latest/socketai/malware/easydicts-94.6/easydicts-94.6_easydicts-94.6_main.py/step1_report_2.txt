{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs as encoded data.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which runs system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen calls that send HTTP requests with URL-encoded parameters containing system data.",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources (hostname, username, current_path, mac_addresses) is encoded and sent via GET requests to external URLs, potentially leaking user and system data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with obfuscated hostnames; concatenation of system info into URL parameters; base64 encoding MAC addresses before transmission; minimal error handling that suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The script collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. It encodes the MAC addresses in base64, then constructs URLs with these parameters, and sends HTTP GET requests to external domains. The URLs appear suspicious and are likely malicious or tracking endpoints. The code does not perform any harmful actions directly on the system but exfiltrates sensitive user information. The use of external URLs, base64 encoding, and data exfiltration over GET requests are typical indicators of malicious or privacy-invasive behavior. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads like system damage, backdoors, or cryptocurrency mining are present. The behavior is consistent with data collection and exfiltration typical of malware, especially considering the suspicious domains and covert data transmission.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily functions as a system info stealer, exfiltrating user and system data to external servers. It does not contain explicit malware like payloads damaging the system but poses privacy and security risks through data leakage. The URLs and behavior suggest malicious intent, with high likelihood of being used for tracking or information theft.",
