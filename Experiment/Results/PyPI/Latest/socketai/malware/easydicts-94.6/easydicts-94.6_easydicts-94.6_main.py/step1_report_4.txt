  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory, and send this data to external URLs via GET requests.",
  "sources": "Platform modules (platform.node, platform.system), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system commands, and the URL request via urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "sinks": "HTTP GET requests to external URLs with embedded system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info is collected from various sources, encoded (MAC addresses base64), then sent as URL parameters in GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of multiple external domains with suspicious and obfuscated hostnames, sending detailed system info to these URLs, and the use of random numbers in URL parameters. The external domains seem potentially malicious or part of a command-and-control or data exfiltration setup. No clear user consent or explicit purpose is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current working directory, MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via GET requests to several suspicious external URLs. The domains used are obscure and likely malicious, possibly used for data collection or tracking. The code does not perform any visible malicious actions on the system but exfiltrates data without user knowledge. No obfuscation or hidden code techniques are present; the code is straightforward, but the intent appears to be covert data collection. The URLs are suspicious, and the behavior resembles data exfiltration or beaconing behavior often seen in malware.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for covertly collecting and transmitting system information to external servers. The use of suspicious domains and the data collection approach indicates malicious intent. No direct malware actions like file modification or system damage are observed, but the data exfiltration activity poses a security concern.",
