{
  "purpose": "The code collects system hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then encodes and exfiltrates this data via HTTP GET requests to suspicious external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), system commands for MAC addresses",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with system info parameters",
  "flows": "Data from system info sources flows into URL parameters, then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to external domains",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious external URLs, base64 encoding of MAC addresses, silent exception handling, repeated data exfiltration pattern",
  "analysis": "The script gathers sensitive system information, encodes MAC addresses, and sends this data to suspicious domains without user consent or logging. The URLs are non-standard and likely malicious. No malicious payloads or system modifications are present, but the pattern indicates covert data exfiltration or tracking. Exception handling is silent, increasing detection difficulty. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation beyond base64 encoding, and the behavior aligns with malicious or spyware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high potential for malicious activity through covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains. While it lacks payloads or destructive actions, its behavior is characteristic of malware or spyware. The current malware score should be high (around 0.75-0.8), and security risk should also be elevated (~0.8), reflecting the privacy invasion and exfiltration activity.",
