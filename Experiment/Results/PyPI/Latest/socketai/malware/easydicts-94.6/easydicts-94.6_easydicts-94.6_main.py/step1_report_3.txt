{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then send this data to external URLs.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), MAC addresses, and generates a random number.",
  "sinks": "URL requests to external domains with encoded system data as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are gathered, encoded, and sent via URL GET requests to specified external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external domains with suspicious URL patterns; encoding of MAC addresses; data collection and transmission without user consent; silent exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers host info, user info, current directory, MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and transmits this data to multiple external URLs via GET requests. The URLs appear suspicious and could be used for data exfiltration. The data flow is straightforward but lacks user consent prompts. The code does not perform any malicious actions like system modification, but the purpose of data transmission to unknown domains raises privacy and security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to collect and send system and network information to external servers, potentially for tracking or malicious purposes. No malicious code execution or direct malware behavior is evident, but the data collection and transmission without explicit user consent suggest malicious intent or privacy violations.",
