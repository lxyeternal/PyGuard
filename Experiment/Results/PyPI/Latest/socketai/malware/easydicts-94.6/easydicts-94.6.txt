      "conclusion": "The primary concern is the execution of 'main()' during setup, which poses a significant supply chain security risk if 'main' contains malicious code. While no malicious code is visible in the snippet, the pattern itself is dangerous. The scores should reflect a high suspicion level, with malware around 0.7 and security risk around 0.7. This package should be treated with caution, and the contents of 'main' should be reviewed before trusting or deploying."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high potential for malicious activity through covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains. While it lacks payloads or destructive actions, its behavior is characteristic of malware or spyware. The current malware score should be high (around 0.75-0.8), and security risk should also be elevated (~0.8), reflecting the privacy invasion and exfiltration activity."
