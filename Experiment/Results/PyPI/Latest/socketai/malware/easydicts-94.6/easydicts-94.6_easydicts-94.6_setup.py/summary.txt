  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the execution of 'main()' during setup, which poses a significant supply chain security risk if 'main' contains malicious code. While no malicious code is visible in the snippet, the pattern itself is dangerous. The scores should reflect a high suspicion level, with malware around 0.7 and security risk around 0.7. This package should be treated with caution, and the contents of 'main' should be reviewed before trusting or deploying."
