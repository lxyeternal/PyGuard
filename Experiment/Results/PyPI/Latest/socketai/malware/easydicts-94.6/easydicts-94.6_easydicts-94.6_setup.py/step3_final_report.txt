{
  "purpose": "The setup script defines a custom installation process that, after performing the standard installation, imports and executes the 'main' function from a module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data when importing 'main' and executing 'main()' during the install process.",
  "sinks": "The execution of 'main()' during setup acts as a sink where malicious code could run if 'main' contains harmful logic.",
  "flows": "The flow starts from the 'run' method of the custom install class, proceeds to import 'main', and then executes 'main()' after the standard install process.",
  "anomalies": "The code executes arbitrary code ('main()') during the installation process, which is unusual and potentially risky. The class name 'CrazyInstallStrat' is unconventional and could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define a custom install command that, during installation, imports and runs 'main()' from a local module. This pattern is risky because executing arbitrary code during package installation can be exploited for malicious purposes. No obfuscation or secrets are present, but the act of executing external code during setup is a known supply chain attack vector. The scores assigned in the reports vary, with higher scores reflecting suspicion of malicious intent. Given the behavior, a malware score of approximately 0.6-0.7 is justified, indicating a high potential for malicious payloads if 'main' is untrusted. The obfuscation score remains 0, as no obfuscation is detected. The security risk score should be around 0.7, considering the high impact of executing arbitrary code during install.",
  "conclusion": "The primary concern is the execution of 'main()' during setup, which poses a significant supply chain security risk if 'main' contains malicious code. While no malicious code is visible in the snippet, the pattern itself is dangerous. The scores should reflect a high suspicion level, with malware around 0.7 and security risk around 0.7. This package should be treated with caution, and the contents of 'main' should be reviewed before trusting or deploying.",
