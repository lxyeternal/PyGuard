  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is straightforward: it imports modules from 'tronyx' and defines constants TRX and SUN.\n- No user input, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- The constants are simple numeric values, likely representing token denominations.\n- The __all__ list indicates intended module exports.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, malware, or security risks.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no issues.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.9 (slightly high but still justified as a cautious estimate)\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score of 0.9 seems high given the code's simplicity. Since there's no actual security risk or suspicious activity, a lower score (e.g., 0.1) would be more appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar; no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** No issues.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, accurate.\n- **Security risk:** Slight variation, but overall low, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The only questionable score is in **Report 2**, where securityRisk=0.9. Given the code's simplicity, no vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behavior, this should be lowered to around 0.1 or 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** Should be around 0.1, reflecting minimal risk, rather than 0.9.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and performs no malicious or suspicious actions. The scores assigned are mostly reasonable, except for the securityRisk in Report 2, which should be lowered.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the code's actual content and behavior.",
