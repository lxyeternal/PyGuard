{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes and constants related to Tron blockchain interactions, likely for a larger application that manages or interacts with Tron smart contracts and tokens.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and constants defined within the same module or package.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or command executions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded token amount constants (TRX and SUN) which are common in blockchain scripts but could be considered sensitive if used improperly. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and consists solely of import statements and the definition of constants representing token units. There are no functions, input handling, or external data interactions. The constants are typical for blockchain code to represent token denominations. The imports suggest subsequent use of these classes for blockchain operations, but nothing in this fragment indicates malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears benign, primarily setting up imports and constants for blockchain interactions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected in this fragment.",
