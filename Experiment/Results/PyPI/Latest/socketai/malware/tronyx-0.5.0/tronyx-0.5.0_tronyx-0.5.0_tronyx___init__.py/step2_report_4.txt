  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code only imports modules and defines constants; no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (initially). Given no malicious activity, risk score seems appropriate at 0. The report suggests a confidence of 1, which is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9. The high confidence is justified, but risk could be lower since no security concerns are identified.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Straightforward import and constants.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=1. Confidence is high, but again, no actual risk identified.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to others, import and constants.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly higher risk score, but no evidence supports this.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. All consistent with benign code.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Most reports assign very low or zero risk, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**However,** the risk scores assigned in some reports (up to 0.9 or 1) seem somewhat high for such trivial code. These scores should be more conservative unless there's context indicating hidden risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0 — The code is benign, with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                     |\n| Security Risk      | 0                     |\n\n**This code is a straightforward module import and constant definition snippet with no security risks or malicious intent.**",
