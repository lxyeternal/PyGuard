  "purpose": "Import modules and define public API for a Tron-related Python package",
  "sources": "None; the code only imports modules and defines constants",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs",
  "flows": "No data flow; only imports and constant definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded values are typical for blockchain applications; no secrets or suspicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the 'tronyx' package modules and defines two constants for TRX and SUN denominations. It also specifies exported names via __all__. There are no user inputs, network operations, or data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code appears to serve as a module initialization or API interface for a blockchain SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs imports and defines constants for blockchain transaction units, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
