  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code only imports modules and defines constants; no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Given the code's simplicity, a risk score of 0.5 seems high; perhaps 0 or 0.1 would be more appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk score?** Since the code is purely import and constant definitions, no real security risk exists.\n- **Malware score?** Correct at 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores overstate potential risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1; the code is straightforward with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Again, risk score could be lower.\n- **Overall:** No issues, consistent with previous.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same observations: no suspicious code, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5. Slightly high; perhaps 0 or 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to above; no anomalies or malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Slightly higher risk score here, but still minimal.\n- **Note:** The securityRisk is 0.1, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as others; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 or 0.1. The current 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** Only import statements and constant definitions.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Risk scores:** The initial scores are mostly 0.5 or 0.1, which seem overestimated given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of sensitive operations, a risk score of **0.0 to 0.1** is more appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** Also should be minimal, ideally 0 or very close.\n\n### Overall:\nThe code appears benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scoring overstates potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 or 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward module setup for a blockchain SDK, with no security concerns. The scores should reflect this minimal risk profile.",
