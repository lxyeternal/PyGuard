  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports classes from the 'tronyx' package and defines constants TRX and SUN.\n- No user input, network operations, or data processing are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or secrets.\n- The constants are typical token denominations.\n- The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n- The code does **not** contain any vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs.\n- No data flows, no untrusted data handling, no network activity.\n- The constants are hardcoded numeric values, which are common in blockchain SDKs.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious intent.\n- They emphasize the lack of data flow, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- They mention the constants are typical for blockchain code, which is accurate.\n\n**Note:** The reports are consistent and reasonable; no logical flaws detected.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0 or very close to 0.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9-1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are very low, which aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Justification for high risk scores (>0.5):**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher scores is necessary.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Malware scores:**\n- All reports correctly assign malware scores of 0.\n- No malicious activity is observed or implied.\n\n**Note:** The malware scores are justified as zero.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they analyze the code directly.\n- They avoid speculative claims about potential vulnerabilities, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n#### 7. **Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n- Confidence levels match the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, benign module that imports classes from a blockchain SDK and defines constants. All reports correctly identify this, and the scoring aligns with the analysis. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk, as the evidence supports a safe, standard code snippet.",
