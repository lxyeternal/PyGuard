  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided code with the claims, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a simple module that imports classes from the 'tronyx' package and defines constants TRX and SUN.\n- There are no functions, user inputs, network operations, or data processing.\n- Constants are large numeric values, likely representing token denominations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n- The code appears to serve as an API interface or setup module for a blockchain SDK.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import modules and define public API.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; the code only imports and defines constants.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; straightforward imports and constants.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import classes and define constants.\n- **Analysis:** Matches the code; simple import and constants.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import classes and define __all__.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent; the code imports modules and defines __all__.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n\n**Note:** The securityRisk score is 0.1, which is very low. Given the code's simplicity, this seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import classes and constants for blockchain interactions.\n- **Analysis:** Matches the code; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0 in all cases; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which is reasonable given the constants' nature.\n- **Confidence levels:** Generally high, matching the straightforward analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- The code contains no malicious behavior; I agree with 0 across all reports.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- No obfuscation present; 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- Overall, the code is benign. The slight 0.1 risk score in one report is acceptable, but I would suggest lowering it to 0 if we consider the code as entirely safe.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- No evidence of secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- The constants are typical for blockchain code, representing token units.\n- The code appears to be a simple module setup or API interface.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\nThis reflects the code's benign nature, absence of obfuscation, and no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final comment:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code being a straightforward, safe module setup. No changes needed in scores, and I agree with the assessments provided.",
