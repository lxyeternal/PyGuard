{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define imports and constants related to the 'tronyx' package, which likely interacts with the Tron blockchain.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'tronyx' package; constants TRX and SUN defined with numeric values.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; constants are hardcoded and imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The constants are simple numeric values; no hardcoded credentials or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the 'tronyx' package, which suggests it is part of a blockchain interaction module. Constants TRX and SUN are defined with large numeric values, presumably representing token denominations. There are no functions, user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The code is straightforward and does not contain any indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard module setup with imports and constants related to blockchain interactions. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
