{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes and constants from the 'tronyx' library and defines an export list for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'tronyx' modules, and the definitions of constants TRX and SUN.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code only sets constants and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Constants TRX and SUN are straightforward and likely related to token denominations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of classes and constants from an external library, then defines constants for TRX and SUN. There are no input/output operations, no data manipulation, and no suspicious logic. The imported classes and constants seem to be part of a blockchain SDK, with no signs of malicious intent. The constants are simple numeric values representing token units, and the export list indicates intended module exports. No obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module that imports specific classes and constants from the 'tronyx' library and defines token unit constants. It appears to be part of a larger project related to blockchain interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks present.",
