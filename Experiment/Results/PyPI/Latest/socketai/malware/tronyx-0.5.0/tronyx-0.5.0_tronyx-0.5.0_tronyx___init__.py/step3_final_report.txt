{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules from the 'tronyx' package and defines constants TRX and SUN, likely representing token denominations, serving as a setup or API interface for blockchain interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tronyx' modules, no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and constant definitions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting solely of module imports and constant definitions. No data processing, network activity, or user input handling is present. The constants are typical token denominations. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks. All security signals indicate benign behavior, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this benign assessment, although some risk scores are slightly overestimated given the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module setup with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is effectively 0. The code does not warrant concern or elevated risk scores.",
