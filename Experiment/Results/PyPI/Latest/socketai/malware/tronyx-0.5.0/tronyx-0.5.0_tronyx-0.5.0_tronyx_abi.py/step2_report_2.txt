  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines custom address encoder/decoder, registers in ABI registry.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward extension; no suspicious code, no external network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code appears benign. The high confidence aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with focus on custom encoders/decoders and registry patching.\n- **Analysis:** Addresses are validated; external functions `to_base58check_address` and `to_tvm_address` are imported, but their maliciousness is uncertain.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely legitimate, but depends on trust in imported functions. Slight security risk (0.2) due to external functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is cautious and reasonable. No direct malicious activity is identified; the risk hinges on external functions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Custom ABI handling, registry patching.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous; no network or malicious code, just registry modifications and address validation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with minor concern over custom padding validation, but likely legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable; no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Custom ABI encoders/decoders, registry registration.\n- **Analysis:** Standard validation, no suspicious patterns, typical registry patching.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate extension, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned; the low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on address handling and registry patching.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, addresses validation, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe, addresses handled properly.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with other reports; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and reasoning confirms no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) mainly due to reliance on external functions (`to_base58check_address`, `to_tvm_address`) whose implementation isn't shown. These functions could be benign or malicious depending on their source, but there's no evidence here to suggest malicious intent.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\nGiven the collective analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — minor due to external dependencies, but overall low risk.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, legitimate extension for handling Tron addresses within an ABI framework. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are evident. The slight concern over external functions is noted but does not elevate the risk significantly without further evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:** No changes needed; the code appears safe and well-understood.",
