  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No data inputs, external data reading, or processing are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The class names suggest use in blockchain or transaction contexts, but this is only indicative of purpose, not malicious intent.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk is rated as 0, which is appropriate given the code's static, non-executing nature.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, with confidence at 1.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.\n- The code's purpose appears to be defining exception classes for error handling, which is standard practice.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- Since the code is purely class definitions with no dynamic or executable content, the risk scores are correctly low.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- The logical reasoning is sound, and the conclusion that this code is safe is justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- Obfuscated score: 0 (clear class definitions)\n- Risk score: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is a straightforward, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.",
