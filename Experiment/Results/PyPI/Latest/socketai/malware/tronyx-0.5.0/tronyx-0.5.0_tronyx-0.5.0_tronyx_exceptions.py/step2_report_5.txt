  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward set of custom exception class definitions.\n- No data inputs, external interactions, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, with clear naming conventions indicating they are meant for error handling in blockchain or transaction contexts.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious code are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code's Content:\n- The code is purely class declarations, inheriting from `ValueError`, `Exception`, etc.\n- No data processing, network calls, or dynamic code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, serving as a structured exception hierarchy.\n\n---\n\n### Error, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident.\n- The class hierarchy is logical and consistent.\n- No logical mistakes or security issues are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is correct; the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The overall risk scores are also zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Suggestion:** No score adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities justifies any higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Malware and Obfuscation:\n- Both are correctly scored as zero.\n- The code shows no signs of malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code's purpose based on class names, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is cautious and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
