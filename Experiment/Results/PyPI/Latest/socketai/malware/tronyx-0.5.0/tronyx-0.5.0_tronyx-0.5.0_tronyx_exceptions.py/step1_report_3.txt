  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all classes are straightforward exception definitions without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for various custom exceptions, inheriting from built-in error classes. There are no function calls, data processing, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The code appears to serve a purpose of categorizing error types for a blockchain or transaction system. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security issues.",
