{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger Python application, likely related to blockchain or transaction processing.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; class definitions do not read or process data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; these are just class definitions for exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code strictly defines exception classes without any unusual or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types, intended for structured error handling. There are no code execution, data processing, or external interactions present. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no malicious logic are evident. The classes are straightforward and serve as custom exceptions, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears to be part of a larger system, possibly related to blockchain or transaction management, but in itself, it is benign.",
