  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard Python exception classes, no data input or external interactions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks; purely static class declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution; static class hierarchy with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with clear naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exception classes. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or dynamic code execution. The class names suggest use in blockchain or transaction contexts, but this is only indicative of purpose, not malicious intent. The code is static, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, with high confidence (1). The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present, and the code serves as a standard error handling hierarchy.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The analysis and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
