  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions in a blockchain or transaction processing system.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; these are just class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exception classes, mainly for categorizing error types related to addresses, signatures, hashes, transaction errors, not-found errors, and other blockchain-related issues. There are no data inputs, external communications, or potentially malicious constructs present. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is observed. The structure is straightforward, and the classes serve as exception types for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a structured exception hierarchy for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system. There is no indication of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
