  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exception classes. There are no data inputs, external data reading, or execution logic. The code is static and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs. They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes without any dynamic behavior or external interactions. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports agree on zero malware and zero security risk, and the code is purely static class definitions, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports assign malware = 0, which is consistent with the code's static, benign nature. No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless exception class definitions.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendation**: No changes needed; the current scores are appropriate.",
