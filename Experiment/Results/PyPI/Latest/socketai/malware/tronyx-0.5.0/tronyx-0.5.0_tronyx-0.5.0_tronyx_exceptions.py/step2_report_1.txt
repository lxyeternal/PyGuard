  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is just class definitions for custom exceptions, with no data input, external interactions, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion that the code is benign and contains no malicious behavior is accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are both 0, which is appropriate. Obfuscated is 0, which is correct. The confidence is 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to report 1, with exception classes tailored for blockchain or transaction contexts. No data flow or malicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** The conclusion of benign intent is justified.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0; obfuscated is 0; confidence is 1.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Exception classes for error categorization, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Assessment:** The benign nature is well established.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0; obfuscated is 0; confidence is 1.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Exception hierarchy for blockchain or transaction errors, straightforward class definitions.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or security concerns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0; obfuscated is 0; confidence is 1.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, exception classes for error handling, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Assessment:** Clearly benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0; obfuscated is 0; confidence is 1.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent.\n- The confidence level of 1 across all reports is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling in a blockchain or transaction system, with no security issues or malicious intent.",
