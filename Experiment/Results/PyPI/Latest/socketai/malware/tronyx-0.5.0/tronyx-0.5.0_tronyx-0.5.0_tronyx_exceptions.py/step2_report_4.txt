  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python exception classes.\n- No data inputs, external data reading, network interactions, or dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The exception classes seem purposefully designed for error handling in a blockchain or transaction context, based on naming conventions.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validity of Issues Reported:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with no data flow or malicious content.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent, logical, and aligns with the code's content.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n\n  These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. This is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security risk:** 0, justified by the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n- **Confidence:** 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Challenges:\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based solely on class definitions:**  \n  All reports correctly dismiss any vulnerabilities since the code only declares exception classes.\n\n- **Any assumptions about malicious intent?**  \n  No. The reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as standard exception hierarchy.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification & Personal Estimate:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is straightforward, benign, and serves as a foundation for error handling in a larger application, likely related to blockchain or transaction processing.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Malware           | 0      |\n| Obfuscated        | 0      |\n| Security Risk     | 0      |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.  \n- The code's purpose is clear and standard.  \n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\nThe code is a benign, standard set of custom exception classes, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious, reflecting the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI concur with the existing assessments. The code is safe, and the risk scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
