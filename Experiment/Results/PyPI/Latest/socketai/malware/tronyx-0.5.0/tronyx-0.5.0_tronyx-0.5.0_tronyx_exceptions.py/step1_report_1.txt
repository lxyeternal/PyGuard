  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code only declares classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow present; just class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard exception class definitions with no unusual code or patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations inheriting from built-in exceptions like ValueError and Exception. There are no data inputs, no external interactions, and no suspicious or malicious code constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or code injection points are present. The structure is typical for a Python project to define custom errors for domain-specific handling. The absence of dynamic code, network interactions, or data processing indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
