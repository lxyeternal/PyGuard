  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a blockchain or transaction-related application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definitions with no execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python built-in exception types. It uses clear class naming that suggests they are meant for handling specific error cases in a blockchain or transaction context. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
