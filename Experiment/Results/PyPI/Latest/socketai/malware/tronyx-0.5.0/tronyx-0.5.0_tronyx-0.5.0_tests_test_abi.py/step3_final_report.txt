{
  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying encoding and decoding functions of the 'tronyx.abi' library with static test data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded input data within test functions, including address string and uint256 value.",
  "sinks": "Assertions comparing encoded hex strings and decoded values; no external data or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is encoded via 'encode_single' and 'encode_abi', then decoded via 'decode_abi' with static data; no external flows or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets beyond test data, obfuscation, or unusual control flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for ABI encoding/decoding functions, using static, known inputs and expected outputs. It performs no external data handling, network activity, or malicious operations. The assertions verify correctness, and the code structure is clear and simple. No anomalies or security concerns are present. The scores from the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with this benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It uses static data for verification and contains no suspicious or harmful behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
