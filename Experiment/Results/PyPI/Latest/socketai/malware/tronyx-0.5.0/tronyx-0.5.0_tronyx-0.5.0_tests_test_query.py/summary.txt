  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for the 'tronyx' library, performing standard blockchain data retrieval and validation. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate; I would assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1), reflecting its safe, read-only testing purpose."
