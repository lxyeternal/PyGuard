  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'tronyx' Python package, including version loading, dependencies, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'tronyx/version.py', reading 'README.md' for description, static dependency declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads and imports only.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from files and modules; no dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with conventional practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks: dynamically loads version info via importlib, reads static files, and specifies dependencies. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. The dynamic import is a common pattern for version management. Dependencies are explicitly listed with safe constraints. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) reflects the slight inherent risk of dynamic import but is justified given the context. Malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the code's clarity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious or obfuscated content. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the code analysis.",
