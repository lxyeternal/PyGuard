{
  "purpose": "The script is used to configure and set up the 'tronyx' Python package, specifying dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version from an external 'version.py' file, and reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "The version number is imported from an external module, then used in the setup configuration. README content is read and assigned as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation, and no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup process using setuptools. It imports version info dynamically, reads a README for description, and specifies dependencies and package metadata. No untrusted input handling or code injection is present. No obfuscated or malicious code is evident. All operations are straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code reads static files, imports version info securely, and defines dependencies appropriately.",
