  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code reads version info from an external file and the README for description, which is common practice. Dependencies are specified explicitly and are benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code performs straightforward package setup tasks with no suspicious behavior. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the lack of obfuscation.\n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk**: Very low (0.1), which is reasonable since the script handles static files and dependencies without external inputs or dynamic code execution.\n\n   These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.1. Given the code's nature, this is appropriate. The minimal risk accounts for the possibility of future misconfigurations but is not indicative of an actual threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is justified because there's no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code patterns and standard practices.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's straightforward functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk due to dynamic import and file reading, but nothing malicious)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The dynamic import of version info is standard practice.\n- Reading the README.md file is also common and safe.\n- Dependencies are explicitly listed and benign.\n\n**Conclusion**: The overall security posture of this code is very high; it is a standard, safe setup script with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
