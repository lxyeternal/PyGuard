  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded network addresses, environment variables, external modules, and dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, system commands, and potential data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input fed into eval/exec or network addresses leading to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded suspicious IPs/URLs, obfuscation patterns, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as dynamic code execution with untrusted inputs, hardcoded network addresses, and obfuscation, indicating potential malicious intent. Reports 1, 2, and 4 show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, justified by their low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 3 demonstrates significant red flags with eval/exec usage and suspicious network addresses, warranting a high malware score (~0.6). Report 5 shows obfuscation and dynamic code execution but lacks confirmed malicious payloads, suggesting a higher malware score (~0.5) and obfuscation (~0.6). Overall, the assessment indicates moderate risk (~0.5), with specific code snippets requiring cautious review.",
  "conclusion": "The code's behaviors vary from benign to suspicious, with notable red flags in reports 3 and 5. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily driven by dynamic code execution and obfuscation patterns. Scores should reflect these findings, with malware around 0.5, obfuscation around 0.6, and risk approximately 0.5.",
