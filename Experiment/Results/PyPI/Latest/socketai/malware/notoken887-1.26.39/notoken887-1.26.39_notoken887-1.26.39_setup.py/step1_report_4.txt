  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python library named 'notoken887', including metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools; package metadata fields; find_packages() call; entry_points for console script",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the console script 'notoken887' (though actual code is in notoken887.main:main), but no direct untrusted input or data handling observed here",
  "flows": "setup() metadata flows into package distribution; no data flow from untrusted sources identified in this script",
  "anomalies": "Author email uses a provocative address ('hitler@gmail.com'), but this alone does not indicate malicious intent; package description claims 'obfuscation test lib' which may imply obfuscation or testing, but no obfuscated code present",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It specifies package metadata, including name, version, author info, description, URL, and classifiers. It uses find_packages() to include all packages in the directory. Entry points define a console script. No code execution, data input, or untrusted data handling is present. The author email and description may be unusual or provocative but do not constitute malicious code. There is no code obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risk evident in this script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
