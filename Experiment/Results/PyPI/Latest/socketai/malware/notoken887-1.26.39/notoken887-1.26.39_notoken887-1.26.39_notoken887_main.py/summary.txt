  "conclusion": "The code employs a pattern of encrypting, decrypting, and executing code dynamically, which poses high security risks despite no explicit malicious payloads. The pattern is typical of obfuscation tools that can be exploited maliciously. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly increased to reflect the inherent danger of such patterns. Caution is advised when deploying or analyzing such code, especially if the TokenCryptor's implementation is untrusted."
