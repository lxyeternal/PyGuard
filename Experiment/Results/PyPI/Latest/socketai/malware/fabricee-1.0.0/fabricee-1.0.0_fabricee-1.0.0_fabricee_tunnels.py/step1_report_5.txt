{
  "purpose": "The code implements a tunnel manager for forwarding network connections over SSH, facilitating bidirectional data transfer between local sockets and remote channels.",
  "sources": "Reading from local socket (sock.accept(), sock.recv()), and SSH channels (channel.recv())",
  "sinks": "Sending data to SSH channels (channel.send()), and local socket (sock.sendall())",
  "flows": "Connections accepted from local socket are forwarded through SSH channels, data flows from socket to SSH channel and vice versa",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network addresses or unusual code structures; no obfuscated code present. The code does not perform any data exfiltration or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured implementation for SSH-based port forwarding, handling multiple connections with threading and select-based I/O. It creates sockets, manages SSH channels, and forwards data bidirectionally, with proper resource cleanup and exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate SSH tunnel utility, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SSH tunneling implementation without malicious behavior. It handles connection forwarding securely and efficiently, with no indications of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
