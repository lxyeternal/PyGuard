{
  "purpose": "The code implements SSH port forwarding, managing multiple tunnels and data transfer between local sockets and SSH channels.",
  "sources": "Socket accept calls, socket.recv, channel.open_channel, socket.sendall",
  "sinks": "socket.sendall, channel.close, socket.close",
  "flows": "accept() -> open_channel -> read_and_write (socket.recv) -> sendall -> close",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity; standard socket and SSH handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SSH port forwarding utility using threading, select, and paramiko. It manages connections securely, with proper exception handling and resource cleanup. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The data flows are typical for SSH tunneling, and no suspicious code is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure SSH port forwarding implementation with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
