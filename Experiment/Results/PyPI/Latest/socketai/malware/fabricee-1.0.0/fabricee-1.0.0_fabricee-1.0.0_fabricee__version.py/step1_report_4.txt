  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple __version_info__ with version numbers (2, 6, 0). It then creates a string __version__ by joining these numbers with periods. There are no data inputs, external data handling, or complex logic. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines version information and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
