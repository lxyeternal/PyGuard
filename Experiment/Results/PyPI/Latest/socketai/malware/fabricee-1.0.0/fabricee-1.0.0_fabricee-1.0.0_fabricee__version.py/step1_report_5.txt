{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package using a tuple and a string.",
  "sources": "The code reads a version tuple (__version_info__) defined within the module.",
  "fires": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code simply processes internal variables.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward version string construction.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple representing version components to __version_info__, then creates a version string __version__ by joining these components with periods. No external inputs, environment variables, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is typical for defining package version info, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration snippet with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation detected.",
