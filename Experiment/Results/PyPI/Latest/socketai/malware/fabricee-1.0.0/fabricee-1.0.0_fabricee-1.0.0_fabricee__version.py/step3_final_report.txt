  "purpose": "Define package version information using a tuple and convert it into a string.",

  "flows": "Tuple to string conversion via join and map functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version declaration code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple of version numbers to __version_info__ and then joins the tuple elements into a string __version__ using '.' as a separator. There are no external inputs, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscation. All reports agree that this is a benign, standard pattern for versioning. The code does not handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any operations that could be exploited. The simplicity and clarity of the code support a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
