  "purpose": "Defines the version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version_info__ tuple.",
  "sinks": "Joining version tuple into a string assigned to __version__.",
  "flows": "Tuple __version_info__ → map(str, __version_info__) → join() → __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard version assignment pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version tuple with three integers and then converts this tuple into a dot-separated string for the __version__ variable. Both operations are straightforward and typical for package versioning. There are no hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or suspicious data handling. The code does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a simple version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version assignment pattern commonly used in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
