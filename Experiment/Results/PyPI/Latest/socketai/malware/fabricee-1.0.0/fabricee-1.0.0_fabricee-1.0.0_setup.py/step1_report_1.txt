  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package for SSH automation, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2), filesystem checks (fabric2, fabric directories), reading files (_version.py, README.rst)",
  "sinks": "exec() call on _version.py content, open() for reading files, setuptools.setup() parameters for package installation",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package naming; reading _version.py loads version info; setup() installs dependencies and creates executable scripts",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute contents of _version.py without validation; no sanitization of environment variables; reading README without validation",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package configuration and setup. The only potentially concerning part is the use of exec() on the _version.py file, which could execute malicious code if that file is compromised. Environment variable controls package naming dynamically, but does not pose a security threat by itself. File reads and setup parameters are standard. No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a potentially risky exec() call on a local version file. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks beyond the use of exec(). This use of exec() warrants caution but is common in setup scripts. Overall, the code appears safe but should ensure _version.py is trustworthy.",
