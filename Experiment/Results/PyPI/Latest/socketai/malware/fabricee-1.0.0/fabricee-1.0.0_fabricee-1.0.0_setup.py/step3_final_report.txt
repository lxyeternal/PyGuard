  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, configuring dependencies, version info, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, filesystem directories, _version.py file, and README.rst.",
  "sinks": "Executes the contents of _version.py via exec(), which could run malicious code if compromised.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variables and directory structure to determine package names; executes _version.py to load version; proceeds with setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on _version.py without validation; no other anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with a common pattern of executing _version.py to obtain version info. While this pattern is widespread, it carries a security risk if _version.py is tampered with. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The environment variable and directory checks are standard and pose no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting a minor concern due to exec(). The overall risk is low, provided _version.py is trusted and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a small, justified security concern over executing a local version file. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The risk score of 0.2 accurately reflects the minor concern associated with exec() usage. Best practice would be to replace exec() with safer alternatives, such as importing the version as a module, but as-is, the code is generally safe.",
