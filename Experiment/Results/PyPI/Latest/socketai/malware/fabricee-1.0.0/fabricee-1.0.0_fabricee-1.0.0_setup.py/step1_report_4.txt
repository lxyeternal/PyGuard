{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up a Python package named 'fabricee', configuring dependencies, package inclusion, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2'; reading '_version.py' file; reading 'README.rst' file; configuration parameters for setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "exec(fp.read(), None, _locals) — executing version file; open('README.rst') — reading long description; setuptools.setup() — package installation and configuration",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2' influences package naming; reading '_version.py' and executing it sets version; reading README for description; passing configuration to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run contents of '_version.py' — potential risk if file contents are malicious; reading files directly without validation; no apparent suspicious behavior or obfuscation in code structure",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including environment-based configuration, reading version info from a file, and setting package metadata. The only point of concern is the use of exec() on a version file, which could execute malicious code if the '_version.py' file is compromised. However, in normal operation, this is a common pattern and unlikely malicious unless the version file is tampered with. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears straightforward and standard for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with minimal risk. The only noteworthy point is the use of exec() on a local file, which could be exploited if the file is malicious, but this is a common pattern in such scripts. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signs are evident.",
