  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package for SSH automation, including dependency management and entry point setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'PACKAGE_AS_FABRIC2', filesystem checks for 'fabric2' and 'fabric' directories, reading '_version.py', and 'README.rst' file.",
  "sinks": "setuptools.setup() function for package installation and entry point execution ('fab' or 'fab2' commands).",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks determine package name and binary name; reading version from '_version.py' and README; setup installs dependencies and creates command-line entry point.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to read '_version.py' content could be risky if the file is malicious, but in a package setup context, it is common practice and unlikely malicious unless the file itself is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: environment variable checks, filesystem checks for directories, dynamic version loading via exec(), and configuring setuptools parameters. No network activity, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The exec() call is typical for dynamic version extraction but could be misused if the '_version.py' file is malicious; however, in this context, it is a standard approach. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are identified. The code seems designed solely for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no malicious intent. The use of exec() warrants attention if '_version.py' is compromised, but otherwise, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain risks.",
