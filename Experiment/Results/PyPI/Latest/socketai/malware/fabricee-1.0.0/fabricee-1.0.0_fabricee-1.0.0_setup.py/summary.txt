  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a small, justified security concern over executing a local version file. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The risk score of 0.2 accurately reflects the minor concern associated with exec() usage. Best practice would be to replace exec() with safer alternatives, such as importing the version as a module, but as-is, the code is generally safe."
