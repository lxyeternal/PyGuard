  "purpose": "Extension of invoke.Executor to incorporate Fabric concepts for remote host management, including host normalization, call expansion, and parameterization for task execution.",
  "sources": "Host data from self.core[0].args.hosts.value, task attributes, and call parameters.",
  "sinks": "Remote command execution via c.run(self.core.remainder) and debug logs.",
  "flows": "Host input flows into normalization, then into call expansion, parameterization, and finally to remote execution commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. The execution of self.core.remainder commands could be risky if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate extension for remote task execution, with host data sourced from user inputs or CLI. The primary security concern is executing commands from self.core.remainder, which could be manipulated if untrusted input is provided, potentially leading to command injection. No malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The risk score should reflect the potential for command injection, which is moderate if inputs are not sanitized. The code itself does not perform sanitization, but this is typical for such frameworks. Overall, the code is standard, with the main security consideration being input validation for command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Fabric extension with no malicious intent or malware detected. The main security risk is the execution of untrusted commands via self.core.remainder, which could lead to command injection if inputs are malicious. Proper sanitization or validation is recommended but not inherently present in the code. Scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in risk score to reflect this potential vulnerability.",
