  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Fabric extension with no malicious intent or malware detected. The main security risk is the execution of untrusted commands via self.core.remainder, which could lead to command injection if inputs are malicious. Proper sanitization or validation is recommended but not inherently present in the code. Scores are appropriate, with a slight increase in risk score to reflect this potential vulnerability."
