{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for use in a Python application, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions and comments only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists solely of class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The comment hints at potential code reorganization but is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward exception class definitions with descriptive docstrings and minimal logic. It does not process input, handle untrusted data, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The comments suggest refactoring or code organization considerations but do not indicate malicious intent. The classes are typical for error handling and do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security concerns. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious patterns.",
