{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a Python project, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data; no input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted data or external effects; no potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behavior present. Comments suggest possible future refactoring but do not impact current security.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes, which are standard in Python. There are no external data reads, no suspicious operations, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded secrets. The comments indicate potential future refactoring but do not introduce security issues. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely defining custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
