  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There is no input/output handling, no data processing, no external calls, and no dynamic or obfuscated code.\n   - The comments suggest potential code organization improvements but are benign.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware**:\n   - No evidence of malware, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code content.\n\n3. **Obfuscation**:\n   - The code is straightforward and human-readable.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment**:\n   - Since the code only defines exception classes, the security risk is minimal.\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Scores Consistency and Justification**:\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code.\n   - The confidence level is 1.0, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - No overestimation of risk based on the code snippet.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate** aligns perfectly with the reports: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0**.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes to scores are necessary.",
