  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to task management and environment validation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions do not read external input or data; no sources of untrusted data present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could cause effects; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are simple exception definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with benign comments about refactoring. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, with minimal logic and no external interactions. Comments suggest potential refactoring but are benign. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present. The code is standard for error handling and does not process untrusted data or perform network/file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. All signals indicate no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and zero security risk. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and should remain.",
