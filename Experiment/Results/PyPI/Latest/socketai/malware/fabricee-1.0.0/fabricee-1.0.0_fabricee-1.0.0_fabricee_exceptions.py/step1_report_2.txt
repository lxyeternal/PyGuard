  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project, likely related to task grouping and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code contains only class definitions with no data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is processed or transmitted to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code only defines exception classes; no execution flow involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no logic, input handling, or external interactions. It appears standard for error handling purposes. No potential security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, defining exception classes for error handling without any malicious intent or security risks.",
