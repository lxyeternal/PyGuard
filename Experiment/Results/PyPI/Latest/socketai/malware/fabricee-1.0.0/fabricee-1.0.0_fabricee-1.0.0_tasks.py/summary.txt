  "conclusion": "The code is a standard automation script with insecure practices involving hardcoded secrets and environment handling. There is no malware, obfuscation, or malicious payload present. The malware score should be set to 0, and the risk score should be around 0.3 to 0.4, primarily due to insecure secrets. Addressing secret management would improve security posture."
