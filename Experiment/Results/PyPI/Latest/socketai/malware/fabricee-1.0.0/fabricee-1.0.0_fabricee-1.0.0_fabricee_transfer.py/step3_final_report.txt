  "purpose": "Provides file transfer capabilities over SFTP/SCP with path interpolation, directory creation, and mode preservation.",
  "sources": "Connection attributes (host, user, port), remote path components, local file or file-like object.",
  "sinks": "Remote server file paths, local filesystem, file-like objects.",
  "flows": "Source data (local files or remote paths) flow through get() or put() methods, involving path interpolation, directory creation, and mode setting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of connection attributes for path interpolation without validation; TODO comments indicating incomplete features; reliance on external libraries without validation; no input sanitization observed.",
  "analysis": "The code manages SFTP file transfers with standard practices such as path interpolation, directory creation, and mode preservation. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The use of connection attributes for path interpolation could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is typical in such utilities. No malicious code, backdoors, or covert channels are evident. The code is clear, well-structured, and relies on common libraries. The assigned malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The risk score of 0.2 reflects minor operational concerns, such as potential path traversal if inputs are untrusted, but does not indicate malicious intent. The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate given the code's clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of remote file transfer over SSH/SFTP, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality. No adjustments are necessary.",
