{
  "purpose": "Package initialization and API exposure via static import statements.",
  "sources": "Internal module files (_version, connection, runners, group, tasks, executor) imported within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, serving as a package initializer. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, securityRisk 0) are consistent with the static, straightforward nature of the code. No assumptions are made beyond observable facts, and the code structure aligns with standard Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization file with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
