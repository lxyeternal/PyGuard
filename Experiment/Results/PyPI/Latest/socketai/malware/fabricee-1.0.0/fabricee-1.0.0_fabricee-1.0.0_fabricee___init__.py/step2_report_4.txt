  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, the code, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a typical __init__.py file that imports internal modules to expose a package API.\n- No external or untrusted data sources, sinks, or flows are identified.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code is purely static import statements, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code is straightforward, and no issues are present. All reports agree on this.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Any logical errors?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent, and the code is standard for a package's __init__.py file.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Confidence scores:**  \n  All are 1 or 1.0, indicating high confidence, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only imports internal modules and exposes package API without any dynamic or external interactions, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score is 0, indicating no malicious activity detected or suspected.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume any hidden malicious code; they are consistent.\n- No need to challenge any claims, as all are aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n| Category          | Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| malware           | 0      | No malicious activity or code present.                                                          |\n| obfuscated        | 0      | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.                                                 |\n| securityRisk      | 0      | No security risks identified; purely import statements.                                          |\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign package initialization file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
