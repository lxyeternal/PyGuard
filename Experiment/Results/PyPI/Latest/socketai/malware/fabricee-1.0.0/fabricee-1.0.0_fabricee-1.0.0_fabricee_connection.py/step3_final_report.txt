{
  "purpose": "Detects and evaluates potential malicious behavior or sabotage in Python dependencies, focusing on supply chain security risks, such as embedded backdoors or covert exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "sources": "The 'test()' function executed at import, which inspects the call stack for 'kitten' and exfiltrates AWS credentials via an HTTP POST request.",
  "sinks": "The requests.post call that sends AWS credentials ('ak' and 'sk') to an external URL ('https://fabriccc.herokuapp.com/zz') when 'kitten' is detected in the traceback.",
  "flows": "On module import, 'test()' inspects traceback; if 'kitten' present, it retrieves AWS credentials via boto3, then sends them over the network via requests.post.",
  "anomalies": "The 'test()' function executes automatically on import, inspects the call stack for a specific string, and exfiltrates sensitive credentials without user invocation or consent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a covert backdoor embedded in the 'test()' function, which executes immediately upon module load. It inspects the traceback for the string 'kitten' and, if found, accesses AWS credentials via boto3 and exfiltrates them to an external server. The rest of the code manages SSH connections, port forwarding, and file transfer, appearing legitimate. The malicious behavior is clearly intentional and designed to steal secrets covertly. The scores assigned in some reports underestimate the severity of this credential exfiltration, which warrants a maximum malware score and high security risk score. The behavior is straightforward, not obfuscated, and highly dangerous, constituting a supply chain attack vector or backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "The core malicious element is the 'test()' function executing at import, which inspects the call stack for 'kitten' and exfiltrates AWS credentials via HTTP POST. This constitutes a covert backdoor, making the package dangerous to use. The rest of the code appears legitimate. The malware score should be 1, the obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score 1, reflecting the high severity of the embedded credential theft mechanism and automatic execution during module load.",
