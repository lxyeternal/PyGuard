  "purpose": "Decrypts code using an external TokenCryptor and executes the decrypted code.",
  "sources": "Importing 'l' from 'extra', reading the encrypted data; using 'TokenCryptor' to decrypt 'l'.",
  "sinks": "exec(decrypted_code) executes dynamically decrypted code, potentially untrusted.",
  "flows": "import 'l' -> decrypts 'l' -> executes decrypted code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' on decrypted code introduces high risk; the actual decrypted code's content is unknown, representing a potential security hazard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an encrypted payload 'l' from a module 'extra' and uses an external 'TokenCryptor' class to decrypt it. The decrypted code is then executed directly via 'exec'. This pattern is often used to obfuscate malicious behavior, especially if the decrypted code is malicious. The reliance on an external encryption/decryption mechanism without transparency is suspicious. The presence of 'exec' on decrypted data is a significant security risk, as it allows arbitrary code execution, potentially executing malicious payloads. Without knowledge of what 'l' contains or what the decrypted code performs, this pattern suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code decrypts and executes potentially obfuscated or malicious code. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data and reliance on external encrypted payloads indicates a high risk of malicious behavior. This pattern is commonly associated with obfuscation and malicious code execution.",
