  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution points, input/output handling, network communication, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated strings.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, environment variables, data exfiltration points, command execution functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or network data flow into code execution or data exfiltration sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted input, base64 or obfuscated strings, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution functions (eval, exec) with obfuscated payloads, hardcoded secrets, and network activity indicative of malicious intent. No benign patterns or standard library usage suggestive of normal operation. The obfuscation techniques, such as base64 encoding, and suspicious network connections point toward backdoor or malware behavior. The high scores (malware=0.85, obfuscated=0.8, securityRisk=0.9) are justified by these indicators. Absence of such features in other code snippets supports low risk elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high likelihood of malicious activity, with obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The scores are consistent with the evidence. No further adjustments necessary.",
