  "conclusion": "The code pattern of decrypting and executing code dynamically introduces significant security risks, especially if input files are untrusted. While no explicit malware is present, the potential for malicious payloads exists. The reports' scores are generally appropriate; malware scores should be slightly adjusted upward where they are conservative, reflecting the high-risk pattern. The obfuscation and risk scores are justified. Overall, the pattern warrants caution, and use should be limited to trusted environments with verified input."
