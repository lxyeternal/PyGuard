  "purpose": "Define package metadata and entry points for the 'notoken887' Python library.",
  "sources": "Metadata fields such as author_email and url; the entry point 'notoken887.main:main'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'notoken887.main:main' when the console script is invoked.",
  "flows": "Installation triggers the console script, which calls 'notoken887.main:main'.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious author email ('hitler@gmail.com') and URL ('https://thugging.org'); no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic or malicious logic. Metadata is suspicious but not malicious. The entry point could execute malicious code if 'main()' is malicious, but its content is unknown. No obfuscation detected. Malware score is 0; obfuscation score is 0; risk score is approximately 0.2 due to metadata concerns. Confidence is high given the static nature of the code and lack of evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, but suspicious metadata warrants caution. The actual security risk depends on the implementation of 'notoken887.main:main', which should be reviewed separately.",
