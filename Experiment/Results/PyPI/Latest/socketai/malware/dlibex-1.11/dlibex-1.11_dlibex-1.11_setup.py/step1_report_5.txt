  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'dlibex' package, with a description indicating it's used for malware development for educational purposes.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources read; standard setup.py inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no execution of untrusted data or system commands.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The description explicitly states that the library is used for malware development, which is suspicious and indicates malicious intent or educational misuse. The rest of the code appears to be standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py is a typical Python package setup script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs. The critical point is the description field, which explicitly claims the package is for malware development. This suggests malicious or at least unethical intent behind the package. The rest of the code, including dependencies and metadata, appears normal and not malicious by itself. However, the stated purpose is highly suspicious and indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is standard, but the description explicitly states that the library is used for malware development, which is a clear indicator of malicious intent. This raises concerns about the package's purpose and potential malicious use, despite the lack of malicious code in this setup script.",
