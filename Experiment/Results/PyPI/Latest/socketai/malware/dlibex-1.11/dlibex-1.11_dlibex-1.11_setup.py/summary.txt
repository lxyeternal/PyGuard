  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard; the only concern is the explicit statement of malicious intent in the description. The high malware and risk scores are justified based on the declared purpose, not on actual malicious behavior. From a technical standpoint, the package is safe, but from a threat intelligence perspective, it should be flagged for malicious intent due to the description."
