{
  "purpose": "The setup.py is a standard Python package configuration script that declares package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. The description explicitly states: 'This library is used for malware development. For educational purposes only!'",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata, description, author info, dependencies, and classifiers; no untrusted input or dynamic code execution occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The script flows from static metadata definitions to package setup; no data flows from sources to sinks, as it is purely configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the description field explicitly stating the package is used for malware development, which is a red flag indicating malicious intent or provocative purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior. The suspicious aspect is the description claiming malware development, which suggests malicious intent but does not reflect actual malicious code. The high malware and security risk scores in reports are primarily driven by this description. Since the code itself is benign, the malware score should be low (around 0.0–0.2), but the declared purpose justifies higher risk scores. The scores in the reports are consistent with the reasoning that the intent is malicious, even though the implementation is harmless. Therefore, the actual technical risk is minimal, but the declared purpose warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py code is benign and standard; the only concern is the explicit statement of malicious intent in the description. The high malware and risk scores are justified based on the declared purpose, not on actual malicious behavior. From a technical standpoint, the package is safe, but from a threat intelligence perspective, it should be flagged for malicious intent due to the description.",
