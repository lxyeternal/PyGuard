The high malware and risk scores are justified based on the declared purpose, not on actual malicious behavior. From a technical standpoint, the package is safe, but from a threat intelligence perspective, it should be flagged for malicious intent due to the description."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of malware delivery mechanisms, including silent remote code fetch, hiding files, and execution without validation. The reports correctly identify these risks and assign appropriate high scores. Slight adjustments could be made to reflect the suspicion level, but overall, the assessment aligns with the behavior."
