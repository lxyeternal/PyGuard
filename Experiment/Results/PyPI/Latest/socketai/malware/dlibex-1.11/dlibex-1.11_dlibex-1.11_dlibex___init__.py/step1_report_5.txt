  "purpose": "The code imports a function named 'get_file' from a local module named 'module'.",
  "sources": "The import statement may read code from a local module file named 'module'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'get_file', potentially to be used elsewhere for reading files; no explicit data flows are shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomaly; the code is a straightforward import statement. No suspicious or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement that imports 'get_file' from a relative module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Since the code is only an import statement, it does not execute any untrusted data or contain hidden behaviors. No further analysis is possible without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It does not execute any code or handle data directly. The snippet appears benign and typical of modular Python code.",
