  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import statement:\n   ```python\n   from .module import get_file\n   ```\n   There are no signs of data processing, user input, external data sources, or other suspicious activity. The code is minimal and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, which aligns with the actual code snippet. They do not overstate potential risks or assume malicious intent without evidence. The assessments are accurate.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n\n   The confidence scores are high (mostly 1, some 0.9), which is reasonable given the limited context.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign zero risk and no suspicious activity is identified, there is no need to justify higher scores. The code is clearly benign.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated code.\n\n6. **Claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They only describe the import statement and its benign nature.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-related issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- If additional context or code were provided, further analysis might be necessary.\n- Given only this import statement, the current scores and assessments are appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign.  \n- No changes needed in the scores or reasoning.  \n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
