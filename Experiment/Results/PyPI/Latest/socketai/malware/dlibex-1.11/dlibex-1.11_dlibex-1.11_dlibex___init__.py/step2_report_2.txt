  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports describe the code as a simple import statement:\n   ```python\n   from .module import get_file\n   ```\n   There is no indication that this code does anything beyond importing a function. The code does not process data, handle inputs, or perform any actions. Therefore, there are no issues present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified because the code is simple and unambiguous.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5. This is appropriate because the code is purely an import statement with no evident malicious intent or security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis. There is no indication of malicious behavior, such as code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize that without additional context, the import statement alone does not suggest malicious activity.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis is appropriate given the minimal, benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a straightforward import statement with no security issues or malicious behavior. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.**",
