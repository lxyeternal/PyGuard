  "purpose": "Import the function 'get_file' from a local module named 'module'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only performs a static import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication occurs; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a function without execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, with no data processing, external communication, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code's benign nature is consistent with the scores and reasoning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
