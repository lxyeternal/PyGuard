      "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of 'main()' during installation is inherently risky and potentially malicious. The pattern is suspicious and warrants further review of 'main.py'. The scores assigned are reasonable but could be slightly elevated to reflect the high potential for malicious activity. Overall, this package should be treated with caution until the contents of 'main' are verified."

      "conclusion": "The code performs covert data exfiltration to suspicious domains, representing a privacy-invasive activity with high security risk. It does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation but warrants caution due to its behavior. The overall malware likelihood is moderate, and the security risk is high, aligning with the potential for tracking or reconnaissance activities."
