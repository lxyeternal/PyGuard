{
  "purpose": "Detect and evaluate potential malicious behavior in the setup script, specifically the execution of 'main()' during installation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data when importing 'main' and executing 'main()' during the run() method of the custom install class.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' acts as a sink where untrusted or malicious code could be run, potentially leading to system compromise or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source: import 'main' and call 'main()' during install -> Sink: execution of 'main()' during setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual pattern of executing arbitrary code ('main()') during package installation without validation or sandboxing; straightforward code with no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during the run, executes 'main()' from an external module. This pattern is suspicious because executing arbitrary code during setup can be exploited maliciously. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. All reports correctly identify this behavior as potentially malicious, assigning moderate malware scores (0.2-0.5) and high security risk scores (0.6-0.75). Given the potential for malicious payloads, the malware score should be increased slightly to around 0.6, and the risk score remains high (~0.75). The pattern itself is a known vector for supply chain attacks, and without evidence of benign content in 'main', caution is warranted.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of 'main()' during installation is inherently risky and potentially malicious. The pattern is suspicious and warrants further review of 'main.py'. The scores assigned are reasonable but could be slightly elevated to reflect the high potential for malicious activity. Overall, this package should be treated with caution until the contents of 'main' are verified.",
