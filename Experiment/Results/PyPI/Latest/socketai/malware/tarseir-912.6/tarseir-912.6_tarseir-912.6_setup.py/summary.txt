  "conclusion": "The setup script's execution of 'main()' during installation is inherently risky and potentially malicious. The pattern is suspicious and warrants further review of 'main.py'. The scores assigned are reasonable but could be slightly elevated to reflect the high potential for malicious activity. Overall, this package should be treated with caution until the contents of 'main' are verified."
