  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs for tracking or data collection purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname via platform.node(), username via getpass.getuser(), current directory via os.getcwd(), and generates a random number via random.randint().",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system data as URL parameters using urllib.request.urlopen.",
  "flows": "Collects system info -> constructs URL with parameters -> performs HTTP request to each URL, transmitting data.",
  "anomalies": "Uses hardcoded URLs pointing to suspicious domains (possibly C&C or tracking servers). The use of random number as part of URL suggests attempt to vary requests. No explicit data exfiltration beyond system info, but the nature of URLs and data collection pattern is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script collects basic system info: hostname, username, current directory, and a random number. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and makes HTTP GET requests passing this data as URL parameters. The domains look suspicious, possibly used for tracking or command-and-control activities. There is no code obfuscation, but the purpose of data collection and transmission to untrusted external servers indicates malicious intent or at least potential privacy invasion. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or system modifications are present, but the network behavior is suspicious and indicative of tracking or exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code collects system info and sends it to suspicious external URLs, which could be used for malicious tracking or data exfiltration. No active system compromise or malicious payloads are evident, but the network activity is suspicious and warrants caution.",
