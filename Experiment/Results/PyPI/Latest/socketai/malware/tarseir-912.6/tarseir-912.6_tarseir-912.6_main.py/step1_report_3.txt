  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs, possibly for tracking or malicious data collection.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls that send data over the network",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) collected from sources flows into URL parameters, which are sent via HTTP requests to remote servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious URLs with obfuscated domain names; gathering hostname, username, current directory without user consent; no validation or encryption of data; sending data to untrusted external domains.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers environment data such as hostname, username, and current working directory, then constructs URLs with these parameters plus a random number. It makes HTTP GET requests to three suspicious domains, likely to exfiltrate or track user environment details. No validation, encryption, or user consent mechanisms are present. The URLs look malicious or at least highly suspicious, as they are associated with potential C2 or tracking domains. The code does not perform any harmful actions like file modification or privilege escalation but may serve as a data exfiltration or tracking module.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be designed for covertly collecting system information and transmitting it to malicious or suspicious domains. It does not perform direct harmful actions but could facilitate user tracking or data exfiltration, which are malicious behaviors in this context.",
