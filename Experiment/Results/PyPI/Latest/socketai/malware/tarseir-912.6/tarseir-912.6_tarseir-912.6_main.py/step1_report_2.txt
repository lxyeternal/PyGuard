  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs with a random identifier.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) which sends data over the network",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path, rd_num) are included as URL parameters in requests sent to external servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs, including suspicious domains; sending system info without user consent; inclusion of random number as a parameter; no explicit user approval or logs; no handling of sensitive data, but potentially privacy-invasive.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current working directory, and a randomly generated number, then constructs URLs pointing to potentially malicious or tracking domains. It makes HTTP GET requests to these URLs, passing collected data as URL parameters. The use of suspicious domains suggests tracking or data exfiltration. No obfuscation or encryption is present, and no malicious system modifications are evident. The code appears designed for covertly transmitting environment info to external servers, possibly for tracking or malicious purposes. The code does not execute harmful system commands or malicious payloads, but it does transmit user environment info covertly.",
  "conclusion": "The code likely functions as a privacy-invasive tracking or data exfiltration script, sending system info to suspicious domains. No explicit malicious system modifications are observed, but its behavior raises privacy and security concerns due to data transmission to untrusted domains.",
