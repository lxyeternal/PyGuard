  "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' unconditionally during installation, representing a significant security risk and potential backdoor vector. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate, reflecting high suspicion and danger. Without inspecting 'main.py', we cannot confirm malicious intent, but the behavior warrants caution and further review."
