      "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' unconditionally during installation, representing a significant security risk and potential backdoor vector. The reports' assessments and scores are appropriate, reflecting high suspicion and danger. Without inspecting 'main.py', we cannot confirm malicious intent, but the behavior warrants caution and further review."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior primarily through data exfiltration to suspicious domains without user consent. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads but performs activities consistent with privacy invasion and potential sabotage. The malware score should be high due to exfiltration activity, and the security risk is also high. Overall, the code is malicious in intent, with high confidence."
