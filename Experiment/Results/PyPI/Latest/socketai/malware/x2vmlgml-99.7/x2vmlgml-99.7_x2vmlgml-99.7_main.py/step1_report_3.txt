  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple remote URLs for tracking or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends data via HTTP GET requests using urllib.request.urlopen to remote URLs, transmitting system info and a random number.",
  "flows": "System info and random number are collected from sources, incorporated into URL parameters, and sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domain names indicating possible C2 or tracking servers. The code collects system info and sends it without user consent or indication of legitimate purpose. The URLs appear malicious or suspicious, possibly for tracking or exfiltration. The code does not include any user interaction or validation, and exceptions are logged but do not prevent execution.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers hostname, username, current directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs to three suspicious domains. It sends HTTP GET requests with these parameters to the URLs, likely for tracking or data exfiltration. The domains used are non-standard and could be malicious. The code does not perform any validation or encryption, and the collected data could be sensitive. The code runs unconditionally, with no apparent legitimate purpose, and communicates with external servers that seem suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be used for tracking or data exfiltration to suspicious domains, which suggests malicious or at least suspicious intent. It collects system information and transmits it without user consent or clear justification. The overall behavior indicates a potential privacy invasion or reconnaissance activity.",
