  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs with a random identifier as part of a tracking or data exfiltration attempt.",
  "sources": "Reads system hostname (platform.node()), username (getpass.getuser()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and generates a random number (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "Sends HTTP GET requests to external URLs with encoded parameters containing system info and a random number.",
  "flows": "System info and random number are gathered (sources), then embedded into URL query parameters (sink) which are transmitted over the network.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with obfuscated domain names, sending system info without user consent, and the purpose of repeatedly hitting these URLs with sensitive info suggest malicious intent. The URLs are hosted on suspicious domains and the data is sent unencrypted via HTTP.",
  "analysis": "The code collects environment-specific information such as hostname, username, and current directory, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. It generates a random number to include as a unique identifier. The URLs targeted are suspicious and potentially malicious, designed to receive the collected data. The code performs network requests without user consent or clear purpose, indicating potential data exfiltration or tracking activity. No other malicious activities such as executing malicious payloads, writing files, or opening backdoors are present. The data collection and transmission are done in a straightforward manner, with no obfuscation or encryption.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be used for tracking or exfiltrating system information to malicious or untrusted servers. The communication with suspicious URLs and collection of sensitive system info without user knowledge point towards malicious behavior.",
