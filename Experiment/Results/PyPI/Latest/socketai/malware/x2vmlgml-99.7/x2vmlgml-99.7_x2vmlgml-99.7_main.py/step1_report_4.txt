  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to remote URLs with query parameters containing system info",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory, random number) collected from sources flows into URL query parameters, which are sent via HTTP GET requests to remote servers",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domain URLs, sending system info to third-party servers, use of random number as a URL parameter, lack of any authentication or encryption, no clear purpose for data collection, potential for tracking or malicious monitoring",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current working directory, and a random number, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains. It sends HTTP GET requests with these parameters to remote servers, which could be used for tracking or malicious data collection. The URLs appear malicious or suspicious, possibly used for monitoring or exfiltration. The code does not perform any input validation or authentication, and transmits system info unencrypted. This behavior aligns with known malicious or tracking scripts that exfiltrate user data. No obfuscation or malware payloads are present; however, the activity itself is suspicious and potentially malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to secretly collect and transmit system information to external domains, indicating potential malicious activity such as tracking or data exfiltration. It does not contain explicit malware payloads but performs suspicious data collection and network activity.",
