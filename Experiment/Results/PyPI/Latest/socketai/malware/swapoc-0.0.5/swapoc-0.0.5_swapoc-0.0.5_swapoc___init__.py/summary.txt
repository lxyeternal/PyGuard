  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their findings; the primary concern is the code in Report 4, which warrants further detailed analysis. Slightly increasing the malware score for Report 2 from 0.3 to 0.5 would better reflect the suspicion due to eval/exec usage. Overall, the security assessment indicates moderate risk primarily driven by dynamic code execution and obfuscation in certain snippets, but the majority of code appears benign."
