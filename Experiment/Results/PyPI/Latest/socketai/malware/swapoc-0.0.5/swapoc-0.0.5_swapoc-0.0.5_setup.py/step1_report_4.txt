  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of a Python project named 'swapoc'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README' file for long description; gathering package info via setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no code execution, network, or data handling present",
  "flows": "Reading README file (source) → setuptools.setup configuration (sink); no flow of untrusted data to risky sinks",
  "anomalies": "The 'description' field is set to 'for rce', which may indicate intention for remote code execution, but it is just a description string. No code execution or malicious activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup using setuptools, including reading a README file for description. No suspicious code, obfuscated code, or external data handling is observed. The description 'for rce' could be concerning if taken out of context, but as a static description string, it does not constitute malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or code injection is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The mention of 'rce' in description is likely just a descriptive string and does not imply malicious activity.",
