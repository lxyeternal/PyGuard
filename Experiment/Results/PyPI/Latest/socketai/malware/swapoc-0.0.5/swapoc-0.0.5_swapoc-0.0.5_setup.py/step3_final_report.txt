  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, configuring package metadata and reading a README file.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README' file, static package metadata fields",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions present",
  "flows": "Static data assignment to setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious description string 'for rce' in package metadata; filename 'README' without extension",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The only notable point is the description 'for rce', which could imply malicious intent but is static metadata only. The README filename's lack of extension is unusual but not harmful. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, with the description being the only red flag. Malware scores are consistently 0, obfuscated scores 0, and risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern. The code's static nature and lack of external interactions confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign and standard, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only red flag is the description 'for rce', which is misleading but does not impact security. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, indicating very low security risk.",
