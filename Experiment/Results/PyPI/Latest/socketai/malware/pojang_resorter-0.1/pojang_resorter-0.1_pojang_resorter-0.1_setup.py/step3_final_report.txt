{
  "purpose": "The code captures a screenshot during installation and exfiltrates it via a webhook, then installs dependencies silently.",
  "sources": "Uses 'ImageGrab.grab()' to capture the screen, reads 'README.md', and uses 'requests.post()' to send data.",
  "sinks": "Sends the screenshot to an external webhook URL, executes 'pip install' via subprocess, reads local files.",
  "flows": "Source: 'ImageGrab.grab()' -> sink: 'requests.post()' to webhook; Source: 'README.md' -> sink: local file read; Source: 'subprocess.check_call' -> dependency installation.",
  "anomalies": "Performs screen capture and data exfiltration during setup without user consent; installs dependencies silently; hardcoded webhook URL.",
  "analysis": "The code actively captures and exfiltrates user screen data during installation, which is privacy-invasive and malicious. It uses legitimate libraries but combines them for malicious purposes. No obfuscation is present. The data flow from screen capture to external server indicates active exfiltration. The silent dependency installation could be exploited for malicious modules. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating deliberate data transmission. Overall, behavior is malicious, privacy-invasive, and stealthy.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious intent through active user data exfiltration during package installation, constituting malware. It is straightforward, with no obfuscation, but performs unauthorized surveillance. The activity warrants maximum malware and security risk scores.",
