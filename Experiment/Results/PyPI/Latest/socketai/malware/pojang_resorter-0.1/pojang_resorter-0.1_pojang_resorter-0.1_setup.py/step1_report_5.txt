  "purpose": "Modify installation process to include screenshot capture and upload to a remote server during package installation.",
  "sources": "Reading WEBHOOK_URL, importing requests, PIL.ImageGrab, subprocess, sys, and open('README.md').",
  "sinks": "requests.post to send data to Discord webhook, subprocess.check_call to install packages, open() for reading README.md.",
  "flows": "On package install, the code captures a screenshot, sends it to a remote webhook, then installs dependencies and proceeds with setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior of capturing and transmitting a screenshot during package installation; installing packages dynamically during install process; sending data to external webhook without user consent.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to capture a screenshot via PIL.ImageGrab, then sends it to a specified Discord webhook URL. It also installs dependencies ('Pillow' and 'requests') dynamically during installation. This behavior occurs transparently during the package install process, which is abnormal and could be used for malicious surveillance or data exfiltration. The webhook URL is hardcoded, indicating deliberate data transmission. There are no indications of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious payloads beyond the screenshot transmission. The code could compromise user privacy by sending screenshots without consent and may be considered malicious or a privacy violation.",
  "conclusion": "The code includes a hidden data exfiltration mechanism that captures and transmits screenshots to an external server during installation, representing malicious behavior and privacy violation. It does not contain typical malware payloads but performs suspicious activities that could harm user privacy and security.",
