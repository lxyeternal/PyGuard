{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for a Python package that, during installation, takes a screenshot and sends it to a specified Discord webhook, then installs required dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment and system (via ImageGrab and requests), and potentially from the package installer context (via open('README.md').read())",
  "sinks": "The webhook URL receives the screenshot data; subprocess calls execute package installation commands; reading the README file could leak local file data if manipulated",
  "flows": "The script captures a screenshot and posts it to the webhook (source: ImageGrab, requests; sink: requests.post); It installs dependencies via subprocess; It reads 'README.md' and passes content to long_description",
  "anomalies": "The code executes a screenshot and transmits it without user consent; forcibly installs dependencies during setup, which could be exploited for malicious package behavior; reads a local file potentially containing sensitive info",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the 'install' command in setup.py to perform malicious activities during installation. It captures a screenshot of the user's screen and uploads it to an external Discord webhook, potentially without user consent. The script also installs dependencies silently, which could be used to introduce further malicious modules or dependencies. Reading 'README.md' may leak local file contents. The code does not appear obfuscated but performs suspicious actions that could be used for privacy invasion or data exfiltration. No signs of backdoors or hardcoded credentials beyond the webhook URL, which itself is suspicious in context. The script leverages legitimate libraries but combines them maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by capturing and exfiltrating a screenshot to an external server during installation, indicating privacy invasion. It installs dependencies silently, which could be exploited for further malicious activities. The overall security risk is high due to active data exfiltration without user consent.",
