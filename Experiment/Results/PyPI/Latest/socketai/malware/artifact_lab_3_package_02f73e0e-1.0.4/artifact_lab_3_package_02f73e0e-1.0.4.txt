The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated at 0, and the security risk score should be modest (~0.2) to reflect the suspicious description without active malicious code."

The behavior is highly privacy-invasive and potentially harmful, justifying maximum malware and security risk scores. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate."
