  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious exfiltration of environment variables immediately upon import, with no safeguards or user consent, and uses a suspicious URL. The behavior is highly privacy-invasive and potentially harmful, justifying maximum malware and security risk scores. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate."
