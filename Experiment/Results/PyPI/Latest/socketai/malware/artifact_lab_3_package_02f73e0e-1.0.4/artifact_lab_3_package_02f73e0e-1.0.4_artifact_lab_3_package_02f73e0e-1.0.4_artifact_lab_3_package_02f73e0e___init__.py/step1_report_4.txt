{
  "purpose": "The code captures environment variables and sends them to an external server.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables)",
  "sinks": "requests.post (network transmission to external server)",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are collected and sent via requests.post (sink) to the specified URL.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual behavior includes automatic collection and exfiltration of environment variables without any validation or user consent. The URL used appears suspicious, possibly an ngrok tunnel, which is commonly used to hide malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and requests modules. It defines leak_env() which copies environment variables into a dictionary and then posts this data to an external URL. The function is immediately invoked upon import. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user knowledge or consent, indicating malicious intent. The URL appears suspicious and likely used to receive stolen data. There are no validation checks, obfuscation, or safeguards, making this a high-risk behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed to exfiltrate environment variables to an external server. It is suspicious due to its automated data transmission and the use of a potentially malicious URL.",
