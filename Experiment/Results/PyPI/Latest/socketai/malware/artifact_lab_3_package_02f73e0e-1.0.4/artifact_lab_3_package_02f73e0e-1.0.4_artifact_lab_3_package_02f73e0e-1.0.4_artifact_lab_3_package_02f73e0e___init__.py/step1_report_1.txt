  "purpose": "The code captures environment variables and sends them to an external server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ",
  "sinks": "requests.post to an external URL with environment data",
  "flows": "os.environ -> env_vars -> requests.post with env_vars as JSON payload",
  "anomalies": "Immediate sending of all environment variables to an external server upon module import; no validation or filtering; hardcoded URL",
  "analysis": "The code imports os and requests, then defines leak_env() which collects all environment variables and sends them via HTTP POST to a specific URL. leak_env() is called immediately at import time, which can occur during package load. This behavior is suspicious because it exfiltrates potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or validation. The hardcoded URL indicates a malicious or tracking intent. There are no safeguards or checks, and the code executes as soon as the package is imported, making it a potential privacy leak or malicious data exfiltration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external server immediately upon import, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent.",
