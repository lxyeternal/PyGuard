  "purpose": "The code captures environment variables and exfiltrates them to an external server.",
  "sources": "The environment variables via os.environ",
  "sinks": "The requests.post() call that sends data to an external URL",
  "flows": "os.environ → requests.post() to 'https://847c-37-47-198-94.ngrok-free.app'",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional data exfiltration of environment variables to an external server upon module import; no validation or user control",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function leak_env() that captures all environment variables into a dictionary. Immediately after, it sends this data via an HTTP POST request to an external server hosted on ngrok, which is often used for tunneling and temporary endpoints. This behavior occurs upon import, meaning simply importing this package triggers exfiltration without any user consent or control. Such behavior is suspicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled server. No obfuscation or malicious code like code injection, backdoors, or system damage is present; however, the act of silently exfiltrating data is malicious in nature. The code exhibits a malicious privacy violation, indicating potentially harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code maliciously exfiltrates environment variables to an external server immediately upon import, indicating a clear malicious privacy violation with no legitimate purpose. It should be considered malicious and unsafe to use.",
