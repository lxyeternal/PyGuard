  "purpose": "The code captures all environment variables and sends them to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ",
  "sinks": "Sending data through requests.post to an external URL",
  "flows": "Environment variables (source) are sent directly to the external server via requests.post (sink)",
  "anomalies": "The code automatically leaks environment variables without any user consent or explicit purpose, which is suspicious. No validation or filtering is applied to the data before transmission. The URL used is an ngrok endpoint, often used for tunneling and potentially malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and requests modules. It defines leak_env(), which collects all environment variables and posts them to an external URL. This behavior resembles data exfiltration, especially since it operates without user interaction or explicit permission. The use of an ngrok URL suggests it may be controlling or collecting sensitive information remotely. No other code, obfuscation, or benign functionality is present. The function is called immediately upon import, leading to automatic data leakage when the package is loaded.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs unauthorized data exfiltration of environment variables to an external server, indicating malicious intent. It functions as a privacy violation and potential security risk.",
