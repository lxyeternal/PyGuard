  "purpose": "The code captures all environment variables and sends them to an external server.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via os.environ",
  "sinks": "Sends data over HTTP POST request to an external URL",
  "flows": "Environment variables are collected and then transmitted via requests.post() to the specified URL",
  "anomalies": "Immediate transmission of environment variables to an external server without any validation or encryption; use of a potentially suspicious ngrok URL; no error handling or validation present",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and requests modules, then defines leak_env() which collects all environment variables into a dictionary. It then posts this data to a remote server, potentially exposing sensitive data such as credentials, API keys, or other private info. The code executes leak_env() immediately upon import, making it a straightforward data exfiltration mechanism. The use of a non-standard, possibly temporary URL (ngrok) indicates an intent to obfuscate or temporarily hide malicious activity. There is no validation, error handling, or obfuscation, increasing the suspicion that this is malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data exfiltration by sending environment variables to an external server immediately upon import, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, such as stealing sensitive information.",
