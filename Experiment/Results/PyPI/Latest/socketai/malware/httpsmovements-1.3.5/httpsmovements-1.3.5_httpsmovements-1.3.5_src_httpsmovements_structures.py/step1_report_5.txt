{
  "purpose": "Define custom dictionary-like classes, including a case-insensitive dictionary and a simple lookup dictionary, used for handling HTTP headers and other data in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Data is received via dictionary initializers, method calls (update, get), and attribute access (__getitem__, __repr__).",
  "sinks": "Data is returned through methods like __getitem__, get, and __repr__; no external system interactions or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the constructors or update methods, stored in internal structures, and retrieved via __getitem__, get, or __repr__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious external interactions. The code implements standard data structure behaviors with clear methods.",
  "analysis": "The classes implement standard dictionary-like behaviors with custom features: CaseInsensitiveDict handles case-insensitive keys using lowercasing and preserves original case for display, while LookupDict provides a simple key-value store with a customizable name. Both classes use standard Python data structures and methods, with no external system calls or suspicious logic. No data leakage, malicious commands, or obfuscated code detected. The methods are straightforward and serve clear, benign purposes within a larger HTTP request context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of dictionary-like data structures tailored for HTTP header handling and lookup functionality. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
