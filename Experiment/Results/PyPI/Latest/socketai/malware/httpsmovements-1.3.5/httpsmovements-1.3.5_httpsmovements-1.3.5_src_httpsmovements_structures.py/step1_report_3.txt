{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for case-insensitive dictionaries and lookup dictionaries used in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data from dictionary constructors, update methods, and key access operations.",
  "sinks": "Data accessors like __getitem__, get, and update methods, which retrieve stored values.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (initialization, updates, key accesses) to internal storage and retrieval functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. No dynamic code execution or network operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-understood data structures: a case-insensitive dictionary and a simple lookup dictionary. These classes handle string keys in a case-insensitive manner and provide basic dictionary functionality. No dynamic execution, network access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of OrderedDict is appropriate for preserving key order. The functions and methods are straightforward and do not include suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides utility data structures for internal use in the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears safe and standard.",
