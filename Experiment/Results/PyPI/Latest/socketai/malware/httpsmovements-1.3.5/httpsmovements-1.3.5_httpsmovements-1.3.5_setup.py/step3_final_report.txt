  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, loading version info and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__version__.py' via exec(), reads README.md, and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "exec() executes contents of version file; os.system() runs shell commands for publishing.",
  "flows": "Version info flows from file to exec(), then into setup(); command-line triggers os.system() for publish.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external version file; open() calls with incorrect parameters (missing encoding).",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py with standard practices. The main concern is the use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if the version file is compromised. The open() calls are incorrectly parameterized; they should specify encoding='utf-8'. No malicious code, backdoors, or network activity are present. The use of os.system() for publishing commands is standard but should be handled carefully. Overall, the code is straightforward, with minor security considerations related to exec() and file handling.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py is generally safe and standard, with the primary concern being the use of exec() to load version info, which should be secured or replaced with safer alternatives. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code's security risk is low but warrants caution regarding the version file integrity.",
