  "conclusion": "The setup.py is generally safe and standard, with the primary concern being the use of exec() to load version info, which should be secured or replaced with safer alternatives. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code's security risk is low but warrants caution regarding the version file integrity."
