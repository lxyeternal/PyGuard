  "purpose": "This module provides the default CA certificate bundle path from the certifi package, mainly for use in SSL/TLS certificate verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads the default CA bundle path from the certifi package via the 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "The source ('where') provides data that flows directly to the sink ('print') to display the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns; the code simply retrieves and displays a certificate bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'where' function from certifi, which returns the path to the CA bundle used for SSL verification. When run as a script, it prints this path. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious network calls, or obfuscated behaviors. The purpose is benign and aligned with standard practices for SSL verification support.",
  "conclusion": "The script is straightforward and harmless, serving only to output the location of the CA bundle from certifi. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
