{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to output the path to the default CA certificate bundle provided by the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package via the import 'where' function.",
  "sinks": "The code prints the result of 'where()', which is a file path to the CA bundle.",
  "flows": "Input: Import from certifi. Output: Printing the CA bundle path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package and prints its output when executed directly. No untrusted input is involved, and the code only performs a simple import and print operation. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code present. The purpose is to expose the default CA bundle location, which is a legitimate function. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility script that outputs the default CA bundle path from 'certifi'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and serves a legitimate purpose.",
