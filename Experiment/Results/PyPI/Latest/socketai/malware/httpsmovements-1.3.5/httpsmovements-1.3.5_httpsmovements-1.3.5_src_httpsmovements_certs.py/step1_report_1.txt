  "purpose": "Provides the default CA certificate bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "Imports 'where' function from certifi package, calls 'where()' to print the CA bundle path.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Import certifi.where -> execute where() -> print to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, only outputs a certificate bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard function from a well-known library (certifi) and prints its CA bundle path. No user input or untrusted data sources are used. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The purpose appears to be informational, aiding packaging or deployment configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The script simply outputs the path to the CA bundle from certifi, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a benign utility script with straightforward functionality.",
