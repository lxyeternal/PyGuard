{
  "purpose": "Outputs the path to the default CA certificate bundle from the certifi package, aiding in SSL verification configuration.",
  "sources": "Import of 'where' from 'certifi' module.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs the CA bundle path; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Import of 'where' as source; print as sink; flow is straightforward from import to output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behaviors detected; code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a trusted function 'where' from the 'certifi' package and prints its output when executed. It performs a simple, well-defined task without user input, network activity, or data manipulation. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the script. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforwardness and trustworthiness of the involved components.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility that outputs the path to the CA bundle used for SSL verification. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
