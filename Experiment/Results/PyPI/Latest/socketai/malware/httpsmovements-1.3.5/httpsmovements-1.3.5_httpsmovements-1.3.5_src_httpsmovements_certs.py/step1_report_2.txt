{
  "purpose": "This script outputs the default CA certificate bundle location used by the requests library, primarily for configuring SSL/TLS verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'certifi' package via 'from certifi import where'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' function outputs the path to standard output, which could be used in downstream processes or logs.",
  "flows": "The source ('where') is called and its result is printed, potentially exposing the file path in logs or external outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code straightforwardly retrieves and displays a certificate bundle path.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'where' function from the 'certifi' package, then, if executed as the main module, prints the path to the CA bundle. The code is minimal, standard, and does not perform any network operations, data manipulation, or malicious actions. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility to display the default CA certificate bundle path used by 'requests'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks; it functions as intended for configuration purposes.",
