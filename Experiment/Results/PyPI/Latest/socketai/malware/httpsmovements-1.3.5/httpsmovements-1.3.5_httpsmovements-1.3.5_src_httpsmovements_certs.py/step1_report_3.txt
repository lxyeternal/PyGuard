  "purpose": "The script outputs the default CA bundle location from the certifi package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the certifi package by importing 'where'.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(where())' statement outputs the CA bundle path to standard output.",
  "flows": "Source: import 'where' from certifi -> sink: print(where())",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and does not include hidden or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a well-known security library (certifi) and prints the path to the CA bundle. It includes a conditional main block that executes the print statement. No user input is processed, no environment variables are accessed insecurely, and there is no data leakage or malicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility script that reports the location of the CA certificate bundle used by requests. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
