{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, and manages the import of various libraries such as urllib3, chardet, simplejson, and standard Python modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from system modules (sys.version_info), imports external libraries (urllib3, chardet, simplejson), and internal modules (collections, http, io, urllib).",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed; the code mainly performs import operations and defines utility functions/variables.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules and setting compatibility flags, with no data from sources flowing into sinks in a way that would cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code primarily performs standard import and compatibility handling tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a compatibility shim for Python 2 and 3, involving version detection, conditional imports, and setting variables for environment compatibility. It imports well-known, trusted libraries and standard modules without executing any untrusted or dynamic code. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The import patterns are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. No sensitive data or credentials are hardcoded. Overall, this code appears to be a straightforward, benign compatibility layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility and import handling module with no malicious behavior detected. It performs no unsafe operations, data leaks, or suspicious actions. It is safe to use from a security standpoint.",
