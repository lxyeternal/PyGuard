  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the module as handling compatibility, version detection, and utility imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing; primarily import and setup.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, standard dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer'.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; low security risk, no malware.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- **malware:** 0 (correct)  \n- **securityRisk:** 0.1 (reasonable, given it's a benign compatibility layer)  \n- **obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe imports and compatibility handling.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct, standard practices, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0 (appropriate)  \n- **obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on version detection, conditional imports, and fallback mechanisms.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with the code, no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights standard compatibility setup, dynamic import pattern, and safe import practices.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate, no security issues.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar overview, emphasizing the module's role in compatibility and safe imports.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- **malware:** 0  \n- **securityRisk:** 0  \n- **obfuscated:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Risk Score:** The highest is 0.1, which is reasonable for a compatibility module with no known vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, given the nature of the code)  \n\nThe scores in the reports are consistent and justified. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured compatibility layer with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk. The provided reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
