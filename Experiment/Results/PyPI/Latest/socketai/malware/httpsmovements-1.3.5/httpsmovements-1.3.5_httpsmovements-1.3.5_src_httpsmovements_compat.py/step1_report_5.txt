{
  "purpose": "This module handles compatibility issues between Python 2 and Python 3 and manages imports for HTTP requests, character detection libraries, and JSON handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules such as importlib, sys, urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer, simplejson/json, collections, http.cookies, io, urllib.parse, urllib.request, and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "None of the imported modules or functions directly lead to untrusted data processing or security-sensitive operations within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules and defining variables that determine environment and library presence. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward, primarily focused on compatibility and import management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various compatibility and utility modules required for HTTP operations, JSON handling, character detection, and environment detection. It includes version checks, dynamic import resolution, and compatibility shims for Python 2 and 3. No user input handling, data processing, or network operations are performed that could introduce security risks. The code appears standard and safe for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard compatibility layer with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. It is purely for maintaining compatibility across different Python versions and managing imports.",
