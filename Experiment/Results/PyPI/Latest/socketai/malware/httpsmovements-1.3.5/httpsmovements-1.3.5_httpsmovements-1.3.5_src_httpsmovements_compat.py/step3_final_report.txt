  "purpose": "Compatibility support, version detection, and import resolution for Python 2 and 3, including optional character detection libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version info retrieval, dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', environment variables, and version checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks; primarily import and version detection logic.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; import and variable assignments are static and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation; standard compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility setup with safe import patterns, version detection, and optional dependencies. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure operations are present. The dynamic import of optional modules is typical for compatibility layers. No data processing from untrusted sources occurs, and no network or system modifications are performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility layer with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate, though a securityRisk of 0 would be more precise given the benign nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
