{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility functions and imports for handling differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as managing dependencies like urllib3, chardet, and json.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from urllib3, attempting to import chardet or charset_normalizer, importing json or simplejson, and reading sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or system modification; primarily import statements, variable assignments, and version checks.",
  "flows": "Version info and module imports are read, with conditional logic based on their values; no untrusted data flows to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and standard for compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version detection, conditional imports, and setup for compatibility across Python versions. It dynamically imports modules like chardet and simplejson, with fallbacks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard library setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and dependency setup module with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard import and version detection tasks for supporting legacy Python environments.",
