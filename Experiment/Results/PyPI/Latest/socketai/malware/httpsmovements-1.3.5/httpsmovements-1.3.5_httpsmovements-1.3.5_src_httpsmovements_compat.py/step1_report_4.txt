{
  "purpose": "The module handles import compatibility and version detection for Python 2 and 3, as well as imports for various standard libraries related to URL handling, JSON parsing, and character detection.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (importlib, sys, urllib3, collections, http, io, urllib), dynamic module import in _resolve_char_detection()",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up environment compatibility; no data flows from external inputs to outputs are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The dynamic import of chardet/charset_normalizer is a common pattern for compatibility",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility setup for Python 2 and 3, conditional imports, and version detection. The function _resolve_char_detection dynamically imports character detection libraries based on availability, which is a typical pattern for optional dependencies. No untrusted data handling, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. All modules and functions are standard and publicly documented. The code does not perform any network activity or data processing beyond setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a compatibility and setup module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows common patterns for managing imports and environment differences without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
