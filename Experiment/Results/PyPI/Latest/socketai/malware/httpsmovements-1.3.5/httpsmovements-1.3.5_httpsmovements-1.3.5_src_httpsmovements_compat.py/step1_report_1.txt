{
  "purpose": "This module provides compatibility support for handling import issues and differences between Python 2 and Python 3, as well as utility functions for character detection and URL handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for various standard and third-party modules, dynamic import of 'chardet' or 'charset_normalizer', version detection for urllib3.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause security issues; the code primarily performs safe imports and version checks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly initializes compatibility variables and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The dynamic import of 'chardet' and fallback to 'charset_normalizer' is standard for compatibility and encoding detection.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility checks for Python versions and imports necessary modules for URL handling, JSON parsing, and character detection. It employs try-except blocks to safely import optional dependencies without exposing vulnerabilities. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or secret leaks are present. The code does not execute any untrusted input or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility and utility support module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for imports and version handling. Overall security risk is very low.",
