  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a compatibility and utility support module, mainly handling imports, version detection, and environment setup.\n- All reports agree that the code performs safe, standard operations with no untrusted data processing.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident across all reports.\n- The code employs common patterns like try-except for optional dependencies, dynamic import resolution, and version checks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with no evident bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious constructs.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None. The code follows standard practices for compatibility.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n\n  - **Malware score:**  \n    All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n  - **Obfuscated score:**  \n    All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n  - **Security risk score:**  \n    The highest is 0.1, which seems to overstate the risk slightly. Given the code's nature, a score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n\n- The **securityRisk** score of 0.1 in all reports is slightly high. The code does not process untrusted data, execute network operations, or contain any vulnerabilities. It is purely for compatibility and import management.\n\n- The **malware** score of 0 is correct; no malicious code or behavior is present.\n\n- The **obfuscated** score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and readable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n\n- No justification is needed for malware or obfuscated scores, as the code is transparent and safe.\n\n- The **securityRisk** score should be **0**, reflecting the absence of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Additional points:\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n\n- No claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions are made; the analysis is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust the securityRisk score to 0** for all reports to better reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n- The current scores for malware and obfuscated are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk | Justification                                              |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0              | No malicious or obfuscated code; purely compatibility code. |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0              | Same reasoning; no security issues.                          |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0              | Standard import and version detection; safe.                |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0              | Compatibility setup; no vulnerabilities.                     |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0              | No untrusted data or security risks present.                |\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a benign compatibility layer with no malicious intent.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0.\n- The securityRisk score should be **0** across all reports, as there are no security concerns.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's purpose.",
