{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for the Requests library, handling various network errors and warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from urllib3.exceptions and local compatibility module; class initializations and method overrides within the module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external output; exception handling is local.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation flows within class constructors, especially in __init__ methods and __reduce__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The code follows standard exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions and external modules. The __init__ methods initialize attributes and preserve error messages. The __reduce__ method ensures correct pickling behavior. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious patterns are present. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception module for handling network errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception class definitions module for the Requests library with no malicious or suspicious elements. It serves its purpose of error handling without any indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
