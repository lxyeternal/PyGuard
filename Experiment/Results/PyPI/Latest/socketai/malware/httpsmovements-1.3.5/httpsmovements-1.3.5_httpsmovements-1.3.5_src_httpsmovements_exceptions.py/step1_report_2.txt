{
  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for the Requests library, handling various HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__), exception inheritance, attribute access (e.g., response.request), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data in exception arguments, response/request attributes, and during pickling (__reduce__).",
  "flows": "Exceptions are instantiated with args; response/request attributes may hold untrusted data; pickling uses __reduce__ for serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code mainly defines classes and methods for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of exception class definitions for the requests library, with standard inheritance and attribute handling. It imports external exceptions and defines custom exceptions, including handling for JSON decoding errors. The __reduce__ method in JSONDecodeError ensures proper pickling behavior. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious logic detected. The code appears standard and safe, focusing solely on exception handling with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception classes for the Requests library, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified.",
