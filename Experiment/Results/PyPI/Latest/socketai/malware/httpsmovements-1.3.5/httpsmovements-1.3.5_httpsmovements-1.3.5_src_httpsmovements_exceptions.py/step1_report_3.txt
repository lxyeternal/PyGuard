{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Requests library to handle various HTTP and network errors.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and import statements at the beginning of the module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; no data processing or external communication occurs here.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of standard exception class definitions with typical inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes a hierarchy of exception classes for handling different network errors within the Requests library. It imports necessary exceptions, defines custom exceptions for HTTP, JSON decoding, connection, timeout, URL issues, and other network-related errors. The class structures and inheritance appear standard and unremarkable. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. The module is a typical error handling framework used in a widely accepted library. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for error handling in the Requests library. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and safe.",
