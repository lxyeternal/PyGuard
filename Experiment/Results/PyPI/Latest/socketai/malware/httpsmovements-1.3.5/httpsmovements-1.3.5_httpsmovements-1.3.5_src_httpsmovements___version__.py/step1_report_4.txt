  "purpose": "This code defines metadata variables for a Python package or module, including title, description, URL, version, build, author, email, license, copyright, and a decorative emoji string.",
  "sources": "None; all data are hardcoded string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted inputs; no data leakage or external calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all variables are static assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated content, or suspicious patterns. Use of Unicode emojis in a variable is benign and decorative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple variable assignments for package metadata. No external data inputs, no code execution, and no dynamic behavior are present. The Unicode emojis are harmless and serve as decoration. The URL points to a common website (Google), not suspicious or malicious. Overall, this is straightforward metadata definition with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as package metadata without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
