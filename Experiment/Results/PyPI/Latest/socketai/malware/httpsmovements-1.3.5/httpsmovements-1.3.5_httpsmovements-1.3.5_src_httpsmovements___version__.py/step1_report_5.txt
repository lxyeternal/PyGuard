  "purpose": "Define metadata variables for a Python package or module, such as title, description, URL, version, author info, license, and miscellaneous info.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements defining string and integer variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; all are static variable definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code consists solely of static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Unicode escape sequences in __cake__ variable, which is benign but slightly unusual; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static values to module-level metadata variables commonly used for package info. All data are hardcoded, with no input, network activity, or execution of dynamic code. The Unicode escape sequences are safe and serve decorative purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple metadata declarations for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
