  "purpose": "Defines metadata for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Module-level attribute assignments at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of Unicode escape sequences in the __cake__ variable; no malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with static strings and values, including metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and a Unicode string. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns. The Unicode characters in __cake__ are harmless decorative emojis. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple metadata declaration for a package or module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
