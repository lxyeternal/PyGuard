  "purpose": "Define metadata for a Python package or module, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative elements.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to module-level variables (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of static variable assignments with no dynamic execution, input handling, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets descriptive metadata variables for a Python package, with no input handling, no external data processing, and no dynamic or obfuscated behavior. The __cake__ variable contains Unicode emojis, which are harmless in this context. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard metadata definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It is straightforward and safe.",
