  "purpose": "Provides classes and methods for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Input data from method parameters, URL parsing, headers, cookies, files, JSON data, and hooks.",
  "sinks": "Request bodies (including JSON and multipart data), headers (including cookies), URL components, and response content and headers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input parameters through preparation methods into request bodies, headers, and URLs; response content is read and decoded for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no suspicious network connections or data exfiltration observed. The code manages request and response data securely, with standard encoding practices. No obfuscated code or unusual runtime behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard HTTP request and response handling classes with methods for preparing URLs, headers, bodies, cookies, and hooks. It includes proper encoding, error handling, and compliance with RFC standards. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious network activities are present. The use of existing well-known libraries (urllib3, encodings, etc.) aligns with normal request handling. Security checks on headers and URL parsing are in place. The code appears to be a legitimate, security-conscious implementation of HTTP request handling in the requests library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard part of the Requests library for handling HTTP requests and responses. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It follows best practices for request preparation and response handling. No evidence of malware or security issues is detected.",
