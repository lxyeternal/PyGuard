  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of HTTP request and response handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk reflects typical request handling risks without active threats."
