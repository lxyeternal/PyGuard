{
  "purpose": "The code implements core classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses within the Requests library, facilitating request creation, URL parsing, header validation, cookie management, and response decoding.",
  "sources": "URL strings, headers, data, files, JSON payloads, cookies, hooks, environment variables (indirectly via standard libraries).",
  "sinks": "Request body (including multipart/form-data), headers (e.g., Content-Type, Cookie), URL components, response content, response headers.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (user data, URL, headers, files, JSON) flows into request construction; response data flows from server to response object, with decoding and parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard practices employed throughout.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and patterns for HTTP request and response handling, including URL parsing, header validation, cookie management, and response decoding. No dynamic code execution, network exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The structure is clear, and security best practices are followed. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected. The data flow from untrusted sources into request components is typical for such libraries and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of HTTP request and response handling, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk reflects typical request handling risks without active threats.",
