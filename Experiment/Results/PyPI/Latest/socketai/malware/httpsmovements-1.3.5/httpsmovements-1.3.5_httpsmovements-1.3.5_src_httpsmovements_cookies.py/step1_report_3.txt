  "purpose": "Compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, enabling integration with http.cookiejar.CookieJar and managing cookie extraction, setting, and manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reading request headers, response headers, cookie data (e.g., in extract_cookies_to_jar, get_cookie_header, cookie-related functions), environment variables, and request URL components.",
  "sinks": "Adding headers to requests, setting or removing cookies in the CookieJar, cookie extraction into jars, cookie header generation, and cookie deletion.",
  "flows": "Cookies are extracted from responses into a CookieJar; cookies are retrieved or set via headers or cookie objects; cookies can be merged or removed based on domain/path; cookies flow from response extraction to jar storage and then to request headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be standard cookie handling logic with clear, legitimate functions. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility and utility functions for cookie management in the requests library, including mock classes for requests and responses, cookie extraction, header formation, and cookie manipulation. All functions perform standard cookie operations without hidden or malicious logic. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network calls, or backdoors. The code relies on standard modules and typical practices for cookie handling. No anomalies such as obfuscated code or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for cookie management within the requests library. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It serves standard purposes like cookie extraction, setting, removal, and merging, with no signs of security risks beyond typical cookie handling concerns.",
