  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the described data flows, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Focused on cookie management utilities, extracting from request/response headers, creating, and manipulating cookies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns. Standard cookie handling.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence, malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is purely for cookie management with no signs of malicious activity. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the overall security risk is low. The reasoning aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar focus—cookie extraction, creation, header management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. Functions handle cookies securely and straightforwardly.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, no malware, risk 0.2, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Again, standard cookie utilities. No issues detected. Malware score is correctly zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Compatibility utilities, cookie extraction, merging, and management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no network activity. Functions perform expected cookie operations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Cookie handling, compatibility wrappers, extraction, and manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. Standard functions for cookie management.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, malware score 0, risk 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The code remains within normal cookie management scope.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Cookie utilities, extraction, header generation, manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. Functions handle data from untrusted sources but do not execute malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, malware score 0, risk 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is standard for cookie management, with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws evident; the code is well-structured.\n- **Scores & Justifications:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature. The risk scores are low, reflecting typical cookie handling concerns but no specific vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — standard cookie handling risks, but nothing critical.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard utility for cookie management in the requests library. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** Maintain the current scores, as they accurately reflect the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed.",
