  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing HTTP cookies, including extraction from responses, creation, header generation, and cookie jar manipulation.",
  "sources": "Request headers, response headers, cookie data structures, and input parameters for cookie creation.",
  "sinks": "Cookie headers added to requests, cookie jar modifications, and cookie extraction from response messages.",
  "flows": "Request headers are read to generate cookie headers; response headers are parsed to extract cookies; cookies are stored or retrieved from the jar; functions support cookie creation and deletion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Functions perform standard cookie operations. No network activity or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured utilities for cookie management in the requests library. It handles cookie extraction, creation, merging, and header management without any signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The functions operate locally on cookie data, with no external network activity or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of cookie management utilities. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low risk scores accurately reflect the benign purpose of the code.",
