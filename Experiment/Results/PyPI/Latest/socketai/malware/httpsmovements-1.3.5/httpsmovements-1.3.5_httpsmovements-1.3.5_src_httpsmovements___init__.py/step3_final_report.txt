  "purpose": "Detect malicious or suspicious behavior in Python code, focusing on embedded obfuscated payloads executed via exec() and related security risks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from base64-encoded strings, particularly the payload decoded and executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes decoded base64 strings, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Source: base64-encoded string decoded by invoke() -> sink: exec() executes the decoded payload.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on base64-encoded strings, heavy obfuscation, and dynamic code execution without transparency.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a pattern where a base64-encoded string is decoded and executed via exec(), which is a classic indicator of malicious or obfuscated code. The obfuscation level is high, and the payload's content is unknown but potentially dangerous. The rest of the code appears standard for an HTTP library, with dependency checks and version validations. The presence of such dynamic code execution is a significant security concern, warranting a malware score of 1.0, obfuscation score near 0.9-1.0, and risk score of 1.0. Without decoding and analyzing the payload, certainty is limited, but the pattern alone justifies high suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious intent due to the use of exec() on an obfuscated base64 payload. This pattern is a red flag for potential remote code execution or backdoor activity. Scores of malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 1.0 are justified. Immediate inspection of the decoded payload is recommended, and the code should be treated as malicious until verified otherwise.",
