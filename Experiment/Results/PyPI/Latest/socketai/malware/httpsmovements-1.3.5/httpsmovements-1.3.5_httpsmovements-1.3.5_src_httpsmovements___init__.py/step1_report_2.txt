  "purpose": "To provide an HTTP library for making requests, handling dependencies, and ensuring compatibility.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dependency checks, and the embedded base64-encoded code executed via exec().",
  "sinks": "The exec() call with the decoded base64 string is a critical sink that executes potentially malicious code.",
  "flows": "The code executes a base64-encoded script via exec(), which can run arbitrary code, leading to possible malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "The presence of a base64-encoded payload executed with exec(), which is suspicious and unusual in standard library code. The payload appears to import modules, set variables, and perform network operations without clear intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages dependencies and compatibility checks for urllib3, chardet, charset_normalizer, and cryptography. It suppresses certain warnings and sets up logging. However, a significant anomaly is the embedded base64 string that, when decoded, executes code that imports modules, makes network requests, and manipulates data. This indicates potential malicious activity, such as hidden backdoors or unintended remote code execution. The rest of the code appears legitimate, focused on HTTP request handling and dependency validation, but the embedded payload is highly suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded as a base64-encoded string executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent or sabotage. The rest of the code appears to be normal dependency and compatibility management for an HTTP library. Overall, this package should be considered unsafe until the embedded payload is thoroughly inspected and verified.",
