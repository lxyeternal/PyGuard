  "anomalies": [
    "Execution of dynamically decoded code via exec(invoke(...)), which can run arbitrary code if the base64 string is malicious",
    "The base64 string decodes to a large amount of code that appears to be related to request handling, possibly obfuscated or generated dynamically",
    "Potential reliance on the decoded code for core functionality or malicious behavior"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up an HTTP library, checks dependency versions, and handles compatibility. The critical point is the exec(invoke(...)) call, which decodes and executes code from a base64 string embedded directly in the script. This pattern is suspicious because it allows execution of arbitrary code and can be used to hide malicious payloads. The decoded code appears to be related to request handling and possibly obfuscated, which raises concern about malicious or unintended behavior. All other parts involve standard dependency management, warnings, and module imports, which are typical for such a library. The reliance on executing external-encoded code without transparency constitutes a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a potentially malicious behavior due to the exec(invoke(...)) call, which executes dynamically decoded code. This practice can be exploited to run malicious payloads hidden in the base64 string. The rest of the code is standard for a Python HTTP library. Given the critical nature of the exec call and the obfuscated code it runs, the overall security risk is high.",
