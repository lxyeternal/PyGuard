  "obfuscated": 0.9,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a high likelihood of malicious intent due to the use of exec() on an obfuscated base64 payload. This pattern is a red flag for potential remote code execution or backdoor activity. Scores of malware: 1.0, obfuscated: 0.9, security risk: 1.0 are justified. Immediate inspection of the decoded payload is recommended, and the code should be treated as malicious until verified otherwise."
