  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot and send it to a specified Discord webhook URL.",
  "sources": "ImageGrab.grab() for screenshot capture, reading the image data into io.BytesIO, and the webhook URL string.",
  "sinks": "requests.post() sending the image data to the webhook URL.",
  "flows": "Image data captured from screen (source) is sent via HTTP POST request (sink) to the specified webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "The webhook URL is hardcoded into the script, and there is no validation or user input for the URL or data. The code performs silent screenshot capture and transmission without user consent prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code captures the user's screen without any indication or consent, then uploads the image to an external Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL appears to be hardcoded and specific, which could be malicious if used maliciously. The functions involved are standard and do not contain obfuscation or malicious code such as data exfiltration beyond the screenshot. The script could be used maliciously to secretly capture and transmit user screenshots, constituting privacy invasion. There are no suspicious functions, no code injection, no use of environment variables, nor any attempts to obfuscate behavior. The code’s primary risk is privacy violation and potential misuse if the webhook URL is malicious or unauthorized.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly captures and uploads a user's screenshot to a specified Discord webhook, which could be used maliciously for privacy invasion. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads, but its purpose and silent operation pose privacy concerns. The code itself is straightforward, but its intent could be malicious if deployed without user consent.",
