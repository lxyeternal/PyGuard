  "purpose": "Capture a screenshot and upload it to a specified Discord webhook URL.",

  "sinks": "requests.post() sending image data to the webhook URL.",
  "flows": "screenshot captured -> stored in BytesIO -> sent via requests.post() to webhook URL.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded webhook URL embedded directly in code; no obfuscation or user prompts.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly captures a screenshot and uploads it to a fixed webhook URL. No malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The primary concern is privacy invasion through silent exfiltration of user screenshots. The webhook URL's presence is a security concern but not malicious per se. Malware and obfuscation scores should be zero; security risk scores should reflect privacy implications. The code's behavior could be misused for malicious purposes, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and functional, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security concern is privacy invasion via silent screenshot exfiltration using a hardcoded webhook. Malware score: 0; obfuscated: 0; security risk: approximately 0.6 due to privacy implications.",
