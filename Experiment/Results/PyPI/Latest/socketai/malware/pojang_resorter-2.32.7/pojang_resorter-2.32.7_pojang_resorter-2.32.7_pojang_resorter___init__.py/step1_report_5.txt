  "purpose": "Provides functionality for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool, mainly by importing main functions and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module .main, and package metadata variables (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths evident; code only defines metadata and imports a local module",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears standard with no suspicious or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module, defines version and author metadata. It does not contain any user input handling, network operations, or credential management. There are no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and typical for a package initializer.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
