  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal package module, importing `main` from `.main`.\n- It defines `__version__` and `__author__`.\n- No functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- No network activity, input handling, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. They note the absence of data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n\n- **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly interpret the code as a benign package initializer with no security risks.\n\n- **Scores Given:**\n  - All reports assign:\n    - `malware` = 0\n    - `obfuscated` = 0\n    - `securityRisk` = 0\n  - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n\n- **Risk and Malware Justification:**\n  - The code does not perform any dynamic or malicious actions.\n  - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external communications.\n  - Therefore, the risk scores should remain very low, close to zero.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?**  \n  The scores are consistent and justified. No report assigns a high malware or risk score, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They acknowledge the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Any overlooked issues?**  \n  No. The code is minimal and standard for a package entry point. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign `0`. The code does not contain malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  Correctly `0`, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Correctly `0`, given the absence of vulnerabilities or risky patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nThe reports are accurate, thorough, and consistent with the code snippet. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: the code is a benign package initializer with no security concerns.",
