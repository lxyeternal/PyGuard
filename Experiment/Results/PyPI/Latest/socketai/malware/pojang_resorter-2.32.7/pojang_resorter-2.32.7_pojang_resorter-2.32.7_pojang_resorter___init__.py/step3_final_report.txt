  "purpose": "Minimal package initialization script importing main function and setting metadata.",
  "sources": "Import from .main module, setting __version__ and __author__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Import statement and metadata assignment; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package module with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. It imports a local module and sets static metadata variables. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and comprehensive. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
