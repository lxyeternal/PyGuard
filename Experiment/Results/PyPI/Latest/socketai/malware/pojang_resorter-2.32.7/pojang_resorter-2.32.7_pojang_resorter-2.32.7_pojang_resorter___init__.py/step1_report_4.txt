  "purpose": "Provides a CLI tool for Pojang Resorter with version and author information.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, module-level metadata (__version__, __author__).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow analysis applicable due to lack of data processing code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no obfuscation or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module setup, importing a main function from a local module and defining package metadata. No input/output handling, no suspicious functions, and no malicious code segments are present. The import path indicates internal module reference, typical for a CLI package. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are observed in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package initialization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It only contains metadata and an import statement, which are standard for Python package modules.",
