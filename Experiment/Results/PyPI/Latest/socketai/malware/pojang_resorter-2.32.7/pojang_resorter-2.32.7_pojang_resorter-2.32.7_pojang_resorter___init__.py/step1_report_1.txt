  "purpose": "Provides basic metadata and imports the main function for the Pojang Resorter CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .main module, module metadata (__version__, __author__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; only static imports and metadata",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward module initialization with no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package initialization file. It imports the main function from a local module, sets version and author metadata. No code execution, no input handling, no external network activity, or sensitive data processing occurs here. The structure is simple, with no obfuscated or malicious-looking code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a package entry point with no malicious intent or security risks. It lacks any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. Overall security risk is very low.",
