  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\nFirst, I note that all reports describe the code as a minimal, straightforward package initialization module that imports a main function and sets some metadata (__version__, __author__). They consistently find no suspicious code, no data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscation.\n\n**Confirming code presence and logic:**\n- The code provided is a simple module that imports from `.main` and sets metadata variables.\n- No code execution, input handling, or data processing occurs here.\n- The import is from a local module, which isn't inherently suspicious.\n- The code structure is typical for a package's `__init__.py` or main module.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n- The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty.\n- No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n**Potential risks:**\n- Given the code's minimal and static nature, the risk is negligible.\n- No signs of malicious intent, such as code obfuscation, network activity, or data leaks, are present.\n- The import from `.main` could, in theory, be malicious if the `.main` module contains malicious code, but this cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. However, since the reports focus solely on this file and find no issues, and given the simplicity, the overall risk remains very low.\n\n**Malware score justification:**\n- No malicious behavior is observed.\n- No dynamic code, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Obfuscated score justification:**\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Overall security risk:**\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a minimal, standard package initializer with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- No changes to scores are needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code content.\n\n**Final note:**\n- While the code appears safe, a comprehensive security assessment would include analyzing the `.main` module and the actual runtime behavior during execution.\n- Based solely on this snippet, the risk remains negligible.",
