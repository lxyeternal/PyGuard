{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'pojang_resorter', specifying its dependencies, version, and entry point for installation.",
  "sources": "Read-only data from package metadata (name, version, dependencies, entry points, python_requires). No external input sources or untrusted data inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "Installation process and package runtime execution via entry points, but no direct sink for malicious actions are present in this script.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining package metadata to invoking setuptools for package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be standard package setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script that uses setuptools to specify package metadata and dependencies. It does not contain any user input handling, network communication, or runtime code execution beyond the setup process. The dependencies listed are common Python packages, with no suspicious or malicious packages explicitly involved. The entry point specifies a main function within the 'pojang_resorter' module, which is typical for command-line tools. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a normal package configuration file with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It simply declares package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
