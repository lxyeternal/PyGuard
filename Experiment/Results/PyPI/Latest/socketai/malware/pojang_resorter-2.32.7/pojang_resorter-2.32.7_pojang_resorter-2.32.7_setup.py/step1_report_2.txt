{
  "purpose": "This is a setup script for a Python package named 'pojang_resorter', defining its dependencies and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies from 'install_requires', and the package's main function is specified in 'entry_points'. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are present in this script.",
  "flows": "The script's flow is straightforward: defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points without processing untrusted input or executing dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. All dependencies and configurations are typical for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It specifies package name, version, dependencies, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. All dependencies are common Python packages; none indicate malicious intent. The script does not process external data, nor does it contain any hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign, typical for Python package distribution, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe to use.",
