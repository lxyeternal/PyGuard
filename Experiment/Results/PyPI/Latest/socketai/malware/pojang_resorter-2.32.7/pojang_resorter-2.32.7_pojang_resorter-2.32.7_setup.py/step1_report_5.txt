  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup for the 'pojang_resorter' Python package including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "User input, setup configuration parameters",
  "sinks": "Installation dependencies, entry point execution",
  "flows": "Installation process pulls dependencies; entry point executes main function from pojang_resorter.main module",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed; dependencies appear standard for GUI or network operations",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, specifying package info, dependencies, and a command-line entry point. All dependencies are common libraries used for image processing, automation, HTTP requests, and Discord interactions. The entry point points to a main function in the package's main module. No suspicious code, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated logic are present. The dependencies do not inherently suggest malicious intent and are typical for such applications. The code does not contain any input/output handling, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior within this script itself.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears legitimate and does not contain malicious code. It is a typical configuration file for a Python package with no signs of malware or security risks.",
