      "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, as it can run malicious code without user awareness. While the code appears benign, this pattern is commonly exploited for malicious purposes. The malware score should be increased to reflect this high-risk behavior, and the overall security risk should be considered high."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors typical of spyware or data exfiltration tools, with no direct malicious payloads but significant privacy and security risks. It should be flagged for potential malicious activity, and the activity warrants further investigation or mitigation. The malware score should be set around 0.7, reflecting high suspicion of malicious intent, with a security risk score around 0.75 due to privacy invasion and covert data transfer."
