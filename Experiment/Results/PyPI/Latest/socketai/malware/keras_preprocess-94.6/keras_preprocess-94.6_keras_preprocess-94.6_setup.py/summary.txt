  "conclusion": "The setup script's pattern of executing 'main()' during installation poses a significant security risk, as it can run malicious code without user awareness. While the code appears benign, this pattern is commonly exploited for malicious purposes. The malware score should be increased to reflect this high-risk behavior, and the overall security risk should be considered high."
