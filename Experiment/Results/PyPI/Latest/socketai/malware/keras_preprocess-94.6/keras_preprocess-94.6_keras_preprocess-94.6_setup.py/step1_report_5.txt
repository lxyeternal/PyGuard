  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'keras_preprocess' package, with a custom installation step that executes code from 'main.py'.",
  "sources": "Importing modules (setuptools, setuptools.command.install), executing 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation.",
  "sinks": "Executing 'main()' function in the custom install class, which could contain malicious code if 'main.py' is malicious.",
  "flows": "During installation, the 'run' method calls 'main()' from 'main.py', potentially executing untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "Custom install class that executes code from 'main.py' after installation; no validation of 'main.py'.",
  "analysis": "The setup script defines a custom installation class 'CrazyInstallStrat' that overrides the 'run' method to call 'main()' from an external module 'main'. This behavior occurs during package installation, which is a high-privilege event. If 'main.py' contains malicious code, it will execute automatically during installation. The rest of the setup uses standard practices, but the invocation of 'main()' in 'run()' is suspicious because it executes external code without validation. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on 'main.py' being safe, which is a potential security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code executes 'main()' from 'main.py' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main.py' contains harmful code. The script itself is otherwise standard, but this behavior poses a security risk due to execution of external code at install time.",
