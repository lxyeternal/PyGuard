  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'keras_preprocess' Python package, including custom installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements for setuptools and a custom install class, as well as the invocation of 'main()' from the 'main' module during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'main' module during the install process.",
  "flows": "The install process triggers the custom 'run' method, which calls 'main()' from 'main' module after standard installation.",
  "anomalies": "The call to 'main()' from an external module during the install process is unusual and could be used for malicious purposes such as executing arbitrary code upon installation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that extends the standard 'install' class from setuptools. During installation, it calls 'main()' from a module named 'main', which could execute arbitrary code. The setup parameters appear typical for a Python package, with dependencies on 'requests' and 'psutil'. The suspicious part is the invocation of an external 'main()' during setup, which could be exploited to run malicious code at install time. No other malicious or obfuscated code is present. The 'main()' function's behavior is unknown; it could be benign or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script includes an unusual post-installation hook that executes an external 'main()' function. This pattern can be exploited to run malicious code during package installation. Without further information about the 'main' module or function, the risk cannot be definitively assessed, but it raises suspicion of malicious behavior.",
