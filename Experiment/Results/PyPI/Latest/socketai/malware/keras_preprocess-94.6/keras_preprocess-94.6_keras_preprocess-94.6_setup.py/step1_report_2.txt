  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for a Python package named 'keras_preprocess' with a custom install command that executes a function from 'main' after installation.",
  "sources": "The import of 'main' within the CrazyInstallStrat class's run method.",
  "sinks": "Calling main() function from 'main' module during installation process.",
  "flows": "During installation, the run method executes and then calls main() from 'main' module.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install command executes an external function 'main' during setup, which could contain arbitrary code. No visible hardcoded credentials or suspicious code within the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom install class that inherits from setuptools' install class. It overrides the run() method to perform the normal installation and then import and execute main() from a local 'main' module. This behavior occurs during package installation. The code itself does not contain any malicious code or suspicious behaviors but executing 'main()' during install could be potentially dangerous if 'main' performs malicious actions or downloads code. There are no signs of obfuscated code or hidden behaviors within this snippet. The dependencies 'requests' and 'psutil' are common and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes a potentially risky operation by calling main() during installation, which could run arbitrary code if 'main' is malicious. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no concrete evidence of malicious intent or malware. The main concern is the execution of external code at install time, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
