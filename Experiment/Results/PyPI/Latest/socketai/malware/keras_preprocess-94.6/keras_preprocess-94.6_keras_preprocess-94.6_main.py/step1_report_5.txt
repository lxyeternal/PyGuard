  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data encoded in Base64 to multiple remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading network interfaces.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send data to external URLs with encoded system information.",
  "flows": "Source functions (e.g., get_mac_addresses(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser()) gather data; data is encoded in base64 and URL-encoded; then sent via HTTP GET requests to remote URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple suspicious domain URLs, Base64 encoding of MAC addresses (which could be used for fingerprinting), silent exception handling without logging, collection of MAC addresses potentially for tracking, no explicit user consent or purpose stated.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info: hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, which might obscure their nature but does not prevent tracking. Data is transmitted to multiple external URLs with potentially malicious or tracking intent, especially given the suspicious domain names. The code does not perform any harmful system modifications or destructive actions but is designed to exfiltrate system info. The silent exception handling reduces traceability, and the use of obfuscated, non-transparent URLs suggests potential malicious tracking or surveillance. No signs of backdoors or malware payloads are present, but the data collection and transmission behaviors are suspicious and could be malicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system info collection and exfiltration to potentially malicious domains, indicating a tracking or surveillance purpose. While it doesn't contain destructive malware, its activity is suspicious and could be used for malicious surveillance or data collection without user consent.",
