  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, and current directory, encode the MAC addresses, and send this data to a set of remote URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() (which reads network interfaces to get MAC addresses), and the random.randint() call for rd_num.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen(full_url) which sends data over the network to external servers.",
  "flows": "Sources (hostname, username, current_path, MAC addresses, random number) → encoding (base64) of MAC addresses → construction of URL with query parameters → network request to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, encoding MAC addresses and system info, and sending this data without any form of encryption or user consent. No hardcoded credentials, but the network activity to unknown domains suggests potential malicious intent or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers host system details and MAC addresses, encodes the MAC addresses, and sends this information to multiple suspicious-looking URLs. The URL endpoints are obscure, and the code performs network communication with external servers, which may be used for data exfiltration or tracking. There are no explicit malicious commands such as file modification or malware payloads, but the data collection and transmission without user consent and to suspicious domains indicate potentially malicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious tricks detected. Overall, it appears designed to surveil or exfiltrate system info, which could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is collecting system information and transmitting it to external, suspicious URLs without user knowledge or consent. Although it does not execute harmful system commands or malware directly, the data exfiltration to unknown domains suggests malicious or at least privacy-invasive behavior.",
