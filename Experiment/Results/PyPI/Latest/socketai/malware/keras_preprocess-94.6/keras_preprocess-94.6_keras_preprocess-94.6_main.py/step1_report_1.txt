  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and send this data encoded in base64 to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses, and hardcoded URLs.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send HTTP requests with system info parameters to external domains.",
  "flows": "Data from platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), and MAC address retrieval flows into URL parameter encoding and is transmitted via HTTP requests to external URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to execute system commands for MAC address collection; encoding MAC addresses in base64 and sending to potentially suspicious external domains; no explicit validation or user notification; silent exception handling which suppresses errors.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers host-specific information, encodes MAC addresses, and sends this data to multiple external URLs. The use of subprocess to collect MAC addresses is typical but could be exploited if misused. The external URLs are non-standard and appear suspicious, suggesting potential data exfiltration. The code does not perform any user notification or consent, and silently ignores exceptions during URL requests. The overall purpose seems to be tracking or data collection rather than benign operation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to collect system identifiers and transmit them covertly to external domains, which could be malicious or used for tracking. It does not perform any malicious actions directly but facilitates potential privacy violations and data exfiltration. The URL endpoints and silent error handling are concerning. Overall, this code warrants suspicion as potentially malicious or at least privacy-invasive.",
