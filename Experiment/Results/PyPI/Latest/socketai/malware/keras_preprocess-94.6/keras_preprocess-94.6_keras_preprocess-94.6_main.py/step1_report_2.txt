{
  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory, and send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() which reads network interface info to obtain MAC addresses.",
  "targets": "External URLs that are invoked with parameters containing system data; network requests send potentially sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info) are encoded, then appended as URL parameters and sent via urllib.request.urlopen to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 encoding for MAC addresses, multiple external URL endpoints with suspicious domain names, no validation or sanitization of data, no error handling beyond exception pass.",
  "analysis": "The code gathers hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, encodes MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data via GET requests to multiple external domains. The external domains are suspicious and may be used for tracking or data exfiltration. The code does not perform any validation or encryption beyond base64 encoding, which is easily reversible and does not provide security. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads like reverse shells are present. The code's behavior suggests data collection, potentially for malicious surveillance or reconnaissance, without user consent. The network communication to suspicious domains indicates malicious intent or a potential security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is collecting and exfiltrating system information to external servers, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. It resembles data harvesting behavior commonly associated with malware or spyware. No immediate destructive actions are observed, but the communication with untrusted domains and data collection raise security concerns.",
