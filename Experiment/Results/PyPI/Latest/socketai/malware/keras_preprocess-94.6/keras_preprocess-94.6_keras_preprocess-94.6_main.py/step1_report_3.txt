  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, and send this data to multiple URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function, which executes system commands to retrieve MAC addresses.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send data via HTTP GET requests to specified URLs.",
  "flows": "Data collected from system info sources is encoded (MAC addresses), then included as URL parameters in HTTP requests sent to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to execute system commands for MAC address retrieval, encoding MAC addresses in base64, and sending data to suspicious external domains. The URLs used are non-standard and potentially malicious or maliciously compromised. No validation or sanitization of data before transmission. Exception handling suppresses errors silently.",
  "analysis": "The code collects hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses via platform-specific commands. MAC addresses are encoded in base64. The data is then transmitted via HTTP GET requests to three external URLs that appear suspicious and possibly malicious, given their non-standard domains. The code does not perform any validation, does not obfuscate its intent explicitly, and silently handles exceptions, which could hide failures or malicious intent. The external domains could be used for data exfiltration or command and control. The overall structure suggests data harvesting without user consent, potentially for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This script gathers system information and sends it to suspicious external URLs, indicating potentially malicious behavior aimed at data exfiltration. The use of system commands for MAC addresses, silent exception handling, and communication with dubious domains heighten concerns about malicious intent.",
