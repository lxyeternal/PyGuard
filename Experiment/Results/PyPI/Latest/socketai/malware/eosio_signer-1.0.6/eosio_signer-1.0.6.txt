      "conclusion": "The code contains legitimate cryptographic functions but is embedded with malicious behavior—covertly collecting system info and exfiltrating it to an external server during class initialization. This activity indicates high malicious intent and security risk, warranting maximum scores. The cryptography itself is standard; the primary concern is the environment info exfiltration, which is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous."
