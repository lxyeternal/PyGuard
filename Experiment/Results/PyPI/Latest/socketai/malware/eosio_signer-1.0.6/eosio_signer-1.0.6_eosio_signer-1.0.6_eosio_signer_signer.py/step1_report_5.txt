  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations",
  "sources": "None; no input reading or external data sources are present in the provided code",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external interaction points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow exists within the code snippet; abstract methods are placeholders without implementation",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward abstract class with method signatures only",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Signer' with a constructor accepting a private key string parameter (default empty) and four abstract methods: to_public, to_wif, sign, verify. There are no implementations, external calls, or data processing. The constructor's parameter is stored but not used within this snippet, and no logic or data handling occurs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. This appears to be a standard, safe abstraction intended for subclass implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard abstract base class defining an interface for cryptographic signing. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security issues are evident. It does not perform any operations or handle sensitive data directly, and there are no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
