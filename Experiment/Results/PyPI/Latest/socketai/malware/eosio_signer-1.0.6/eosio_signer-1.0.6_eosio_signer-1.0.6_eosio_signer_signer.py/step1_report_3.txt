  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for cryptographic signing operations",
  "sources": "Initialization of private_str attribute (though unused), abstract method signatures",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "No executable flows; abstract methods imply subclasses will implement actual logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class 'Signer' with an unused parameter 'private_str'. All methods are abstract and intended for subclass implementation. No data is processed or transmitted within this code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The class structure appears to be a standard interface for cryptographic signing functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, harmless abstract class interface for signing operations. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks present.",
