  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow identified beyond the import statement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code observed in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing EOSIOKey from a local module named key. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. The import alone does not indicate malicious intent, though it depends on the contents of the imported module, which are not provided. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no detectable malicious behavior or security issues based on the provided code.",
