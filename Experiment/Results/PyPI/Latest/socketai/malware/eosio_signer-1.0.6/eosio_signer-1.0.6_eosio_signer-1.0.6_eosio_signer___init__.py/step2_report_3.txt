  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code snippet: `from .key import EOSIOKey`.\n- The reports consistently conclude that this is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the lack of malicious activity in the snippet.\n- Security risk scores are very low (0 to 0.1), which is reasonable for such a trivial import statement.\n\n**Confirmations and potential issues:**\n- The code snippet itself does not contain any errors, flaws, or suspicious logic.\n- The import is from a local module, which is standard practice.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code in the provided snippet.\n- Since the imported module's contents are unknown, we cannot assess if `EOSIOKey` itself is malicious or insecure, but based on the import statement alone, there's no indication of risk.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the minimal code:\n  - Malware: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n  - Risk: very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is justified for such a benign import.\n\n**Any adjustments needed?**\n- No, the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The high confidence levels are justified, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.05 (slightly above zero to account for unknowns about the imported module, but still negligible)\n\n**Final note:**\n- If future code involving `EOSIOKey` or the `key` module introduces suspicious behavior, re-evaluation would be necessary.\n- For now, based solely on this import statement, the code is safe and poses no security concern.",
