{
  "purpose": "This code imports the EOSIOKey class from a local module named key, likely for cryptographic or key management purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs a static import operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no functions, data processing, or network activity. The import of EOSIOKey from the local key module does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent. Given the absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution, the snippet appears benign. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The confidence in this assessment is high, as the code is straightforward and standard. The overall security posture based on this snippet is very low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
