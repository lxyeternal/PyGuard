  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'eosio_signer' package, intended to prepare installation and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA), system commands (hostname, whoami, ifconfig), and file read/write operations.",
  "sinks": "Sending data via curl POST request to an external IP (61.28.229.27); writing to /tmp/r; reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> /tmp/r file; system commands -> /tmp/r; /tmp/r content -> HTTP POST request to external server.",
  "anomalies": "Unconditional execution of system commands that gather system info and send it over the network; use of environment variables without validation; hardcoded external IP address; appending sensitive info to a temporary file.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves environment variables that could contain sensitive data. It executes system commands to gather system information and appends this data, along with environment variable values, into a temporary file. Immediately afterward, it uploads this file to an external IP address via a curl POST request, indicating potential exfiltration of sensitive or system data. The setup function is otherwise standard, but the inclusion of network communication and data collection at setup time is suspicious. No other dependencies or entry points are configured. The code does not perform any benign setup tasks; instead, it collects and transmits system info, which is typical of malicious or exfiltration behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits malicious behavior by collecting system information and exfiltrating it to an external server without any user consent or safeguards. This behavior indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, potentially for spying or data theft.",
