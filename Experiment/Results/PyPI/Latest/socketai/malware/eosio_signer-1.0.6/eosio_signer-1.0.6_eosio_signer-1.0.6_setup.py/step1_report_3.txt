{
  "purpose": "Set up a Python package named 'eosio_signer' and execute system commands during installation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'BX_API_HOSTNAME', 'BX_PRIVATE_KEY', 'BX_API_METADATA'; system commands executed via os.system",
  "sinks": "System commands: hostname, whoami, ifconfig, and a curl POST request transmitting data to an external IP",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and appended to a temporary file; system commands gather system info and then send data over network via curl",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system to run multiple system commands including potentially sensitive data exfiltration; writing environment data and system info to a file and then uploading it to an external IP address",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves sensitive data from environment variables, captures system information, writes all this to a temporary file, and then uploads that file to an external IP address. The data includes hostname, private key, and metadata, which suggests potential exfiltration. The use of os.system to run commands and send data over the network without validation or user consent indicates malicious intent or at least malicious behavior. No dependencies or entry points are configured, and the rest of the setup appears standard but is overshadowed by the data exfiltration activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive environment data and system info, then exfiltrating it to an external server, indicating high security concern. This is likely malicious activity disguised within a package setup script.",
