{
  "purpose": "The code collects environment variables and system info, then exfiltrates this data to an external IP during package setup, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BX_API_HOSTNAME, BX_PRIVATE_KEY, BX_API_METADATA), system commands (hostname, whoami, ifconfig).",
  "sinks": "The file /tmp/r where data is written, and the curl command that uploads /tmp/r to an external server.",
  "flows": "Data is read from environment variables and system commands, written to /tmp/r, then exfiltrated via curl to an external IP.",
  "anomalies": "Execution of system commands via os.system, writing sensitive info to a temporary file, and immediate exfiltration during setup without validation or encryption.",
  "analysis": "The code reads sensitive environment variables and system info, appends this data to /tmp/r, and uploads it to a hardcoded external IP address using curl. The commands are straightforward, with no obfuscation, indicating clear malicious intent. The exfiltration occurs during package installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious. The high malware score (1.0) and security risk score (1.0) are justified due to the data theft behavior. The lack of obfuscation is consistent with the straightforward nature of the code. The activity aligns with malicious data exfiltration or spyware, warranting high concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior involving data collection and exfiltration to an external server. The high malware and security risk scores are justified and should be flagged for further review or removal from supply chain sources.",
