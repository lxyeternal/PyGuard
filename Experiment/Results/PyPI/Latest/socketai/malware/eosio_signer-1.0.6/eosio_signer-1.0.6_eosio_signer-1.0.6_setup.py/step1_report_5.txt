  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package 'eosio_signer' with additional code executing system commands and environment variable collection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'BX_API_HOSTNAME', 'BX_PRIVATE_KEY', 'BX_API_METADATA'; os.system commands executing hostname, whoami, ifconfig; file reading and writing to /tmp/r; network POST request to a suspicious IP.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing system commands and network POST request; writing to /tmp/r; reading environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> /tmp/r content (hostname, user, network info) -> os.system commands -> POST request to external IP with /tmp/r contents.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for executing system commands, including gathering system info and network activity, which can be suspicious. Uploading /tmp/r to an external IP is highly suspicious and indicates potential data exfiltration. The code gathers environment info and system details unconditionally, then exfiltrates it.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables that could contain sensitive data. It executes system commands to collect system info and appends the environment variables to a temporary file. Subsequently, it uploads this file to an external IP address via an HTTP POST request. This behavior suggests data collection and potential exfiltration, which is indicative of malicious activity. The setup function appears normal, but the additional code outside setup introduces security concerns. No obfuscation is evident, but the behavior of collecting and exfiltrating data is malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains suspicious behavior related to system information gathering and data exfiltration via an external network request. This indicates malicious intent, likely aimed at spying or data theft. The setup process itself appears standard, but the added commands are malicious. Overall, the package exhibits high security risk due to these activities.",
