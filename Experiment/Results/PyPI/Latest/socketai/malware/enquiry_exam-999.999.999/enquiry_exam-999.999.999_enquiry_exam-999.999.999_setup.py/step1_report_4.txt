{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'enquiry_exam'.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() function such as name, version, author, author_email, description, packages, and install_requires.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no dynamic code execution or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "N/A, all data is hardcoded in the setup function.",
  "anomalies": "The version number '999.999.999' is unusually high, which is unconventional. The description claims it is a 'Malicious backdoor package,' indicating intent to deceive. The author email 'attacker@example.com' is suspicious and suggests malicious intent. The package name matches internal expectations, potentially to disguise maliciousness.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script but contains several suspicious indicators. The version number is abnormally high, possibly to evade version checks or appear as a custom build. The description explicitly states 'Malicious backdoor package,' which is a direct indicator of malicious intent. The author email 'attacker@example.com' is suspicious and likely intentionally chosen to mislead or for malicious attribution. Overall, the code itself does not perform malicious actions but is intentionally deceptive, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is designed to appear as a legitimate package but explicitly states it is malicious. The metadata suggests the package aims to deceive users or other systems into trusting it, likely to deliver malicious payloads or backdoors when installed. This code constitutes malicious intent based solely on its declared purpose and metadata.",
