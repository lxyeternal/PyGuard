{
  "purpose": "Define and package a Python library named 'enquiry_exam' with metadata, potentially including malicious intent as indicated by description.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded package metadata such as name, version, author, author_email, description, and package list.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks like network, file, or system commands are present. No untrusted data is processed or stored.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs. The setup script solely defines package metadata without dynamic data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a very high version number ('999.999.999') and the description 'Malicious backdoor package' are suspicious and unusual. The email address 'attacker@example.com' is potentially malicious or deceptive.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' to define package metadata. The metadata includes an intentionally high version number and a description suggesting malicious intent. No dependencies or code execution are present. The suspicious elements are limited to metadata fields that could mislead users about the package's intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself performs a standard package setup with suspicious metadata indicating potential malicious intent. There is no active malicious code, backdoor, or malicious behavior in this script, but the metadata hints at a malicious purpose if installed or used.",
