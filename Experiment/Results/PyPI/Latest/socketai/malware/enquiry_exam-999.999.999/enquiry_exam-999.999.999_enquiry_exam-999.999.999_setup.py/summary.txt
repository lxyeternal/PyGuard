  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but designed to appear malicious through deceptive metadata. The explicit description and suspicious version number and email suggest malicious intent. Therefore, the malware score should be high (~0.8), the obfuscated score zero, and the security risk score also high (~0.8), indicating a package that could deceive users and potentially deliver malicious payloads if additional code exists elsewhere. The overall assessment is that this package is highly suspicious and warrants caution."
