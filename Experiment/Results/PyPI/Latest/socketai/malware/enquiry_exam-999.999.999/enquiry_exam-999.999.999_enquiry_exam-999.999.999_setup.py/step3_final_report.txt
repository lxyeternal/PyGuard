  "purpose": "Define package metadata for distribution; no malicious behavior embedded.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields: name, version, author, author_email, description, packages, install_requires.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or code execution beyond static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious metadata: high version number '999.999.999', author_email 'attacker@example.com', description explicitly states 'Malicious backdoor package'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with static metadata. No dynamic code, payloads, or obfuscated logic are present. The suspicious elements are solely in the metadata, which explicitly indicates malicious intent. The high version number and malicious description are common tactics to mislead or evade detection. The author email is also suspicious. Since no malicious code exists in this snippet, the actual malware and obfuscation scores should be low. However, the metadata's explicit malicious indicators justify high security risk scores. The scores should reflect the potential for deception and malicious intent based on metadata, not active payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but designed to appear malicious through deceptive metadata. The explicit description and suspicious version number and email suggest malicious intent. Therefore, the malware score should be high (~0.8), the obfuscated score zero, and the security risk score also high (~0.8), indicating a package that could deceive users and potentially deliver malicious payloads if additional code exists elsewhere. The overall assessment is that this package is highly suspicious and warrants caution.",
