  "purpose": "The code collects system hostname, IP address, and username, then exfiltrates this data to an attacker-controlled server. It also contains a commented-out reverse shell payload for remote access.",
  "sources": "socket.gethostname(), socket.gethostbyname(), os.getenv('USER') or os.getenv('USERNAME')",
  "sinks": "requests.post() to external URL, subprocess.call() executing bash reverse shell",
  "flows": "Data from hostname, IP, username → requests.post() to attacker server; (if activated) reverse shell payload → remote attacker via subprocess.call()",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded attacker URL and IP, presence of reverse shell code commented out, straightforward data exfiltration without obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The script explicitly performs data exfiltration by sending system info to a hardcoded external server, indicating malicious intent. The reverse shell payload, though commented out, is present and capable of remote code execution if activated. No obfuscation or benign purpose is evident. The code's behavior aligns with typical malicious activity such as data theft and remote control capabilities. The hardcoded attacker details and the payload's presence justify high malware and security risk scores. The code's straightforward structure and lack of obfuscation support a low obfuscated score. The malicious capabilities are clear and significant, warranting maximum risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, designed for data exfiltration and potential remote access via reverse shell. The presence of hardcoded attacker details and the payload confirms malicious intent. The scores of malware=1, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=1 are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
