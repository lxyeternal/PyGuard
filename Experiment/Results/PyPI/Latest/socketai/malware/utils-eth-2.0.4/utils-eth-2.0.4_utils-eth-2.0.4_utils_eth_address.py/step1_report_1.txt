  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for handling and validating Ethereum addresses in various formats, including normalization, checksum validation, and conversion between representations.",
  "sources": "Input values are read in functions like is_hex_address, is_binary_address, is_address, to_normalized_address, is_normalized_address, to_canonical_address, is_canonical_address, is_same_address, to_checksum_address, is_checksum_address, and _is_checksum_formatted. Data can originate from user input, other modules, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data into system-critical operations such as file I/O, network, or subprocess execution are present. The functions mainly perform validation, conversion, and comparison without executing external commands or affecting system state.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables through validation and transformation functions, often involving normalization or formatting. For example, user-provided address strings flow through normalization functions, then into checksum validation, but no harmful or unsafe operations are performed on these flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalous or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The regex is straightforward for address validation. The functions rely on standard cryptographic hashing (keccak) for checksum calculation, which is typical for Ethereum address handling. There are no indications of malicious behavior or covert operations.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly offers address validation, normalization, and formatting utilities consistent with Ethereum standards. Functions like is_hex_address, is_binary_address, and is_address are simple validation checks. Conversion functions like to_normalized_address and to_checksum_address use standard procedures, including keccak hashing for checksum creation. No code executes external commands, handles sensitive data insecurely, or performs any system modifications. The code is structured clearly with validation at each step. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful side effects. The regex and string manipulations are standard and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward utility module for Ethereum address handling with no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks detected. It functions solely to validate, convert, and compare addresses following Ethereum standards. Its design appears safe and consistent with expected cryptographic and data validation practices.",
