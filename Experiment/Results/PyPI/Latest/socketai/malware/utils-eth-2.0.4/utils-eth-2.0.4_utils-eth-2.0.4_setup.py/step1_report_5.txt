{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for a Python package called 'utils-eth', including dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "File reading the README.md for long description, and static data in setup() parameters including dependencies and package info.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "The static data from file read and the data passed to setup() are used for package configuration; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setup utilities from setuptools, reads a README.md file for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network operations, or data manipulations that could introduce security issues. The dependencies are version-restricted, and the code structure follows standard Python package setup patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies, with no external or untrusted data handling.",
