{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'utils-eth', including dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup and find_packages from setuptools, and defining dependencies within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs that handle untrusted data or user input; the code mainly deals with package setup metadata.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code flows from reading static files and defining package configuration to invoking setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; all code pertains to package setup and dependency management without any obfuscated or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, including reading a README file, defining dependencies, and configuring package metadata. It uses common practices for Python package distribution with no code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious activities. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or dynamic code execution are present. The dependencies specified are standard for Ethereum-related Python projects and are appropriately constrained. There are no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration file for publishing a package related to Ethereum utilities.",
