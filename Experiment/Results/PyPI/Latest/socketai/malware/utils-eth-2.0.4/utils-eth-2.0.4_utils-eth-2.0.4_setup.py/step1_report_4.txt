{
  "purpose": "This code defines setup configuration for a Python package called 'utils-eth', including dependencies, package data, and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, defining dependencies, and package discovery with find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; setup parameters are static or from controlled sources.",
  "flows": "Reading file content for long_description, passing static data and dependencies into setup(), no untrusted data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code; dependencies are standard and well-defined.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup procedures using setuptools, with dependency specifications and package metadata. No dynamic or unsafe code execution is present. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The dependencies are standard for package setup, and all code appears to be static configuration. The file reads a README file for description, which is standard practice. No anomalies or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious activity.",
