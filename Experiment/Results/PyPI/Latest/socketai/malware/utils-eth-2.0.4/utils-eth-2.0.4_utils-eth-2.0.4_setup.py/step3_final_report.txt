  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'utils-eth', configuring dependencies, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, importing setuptools modules, defining dependencies and extras.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reading static files and setting package metadata; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, static setup script utilizing setuptools. Dependencies are version-constrained and from trusted sources. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The code structure is clear, and the purpose is solely package configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score of 0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
