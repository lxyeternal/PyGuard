{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'utils-eth', including dependencies, metadata, and packaging instructions.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, and defines dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified. No execution of external or untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads external file (README.md) for description, then proceeds with package setup. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The dependencies and code are typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines using setuptools, specifying dependencies, package metadata, and extras. No code execution, network operations, or untrusted data processing is present. All external dependencies are versioned and sourced from known repositories. No obfuscated code, malicious constructs, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily manages package configuration and dependencies.",
