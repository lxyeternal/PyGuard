  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present",
  "sinks": "No data output or external data writing present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; class is a simple exception definition",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class 'ValidationError' inheriting from Exception. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose and a 'pass' statement. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. The structure is straightforward and conventional for custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
