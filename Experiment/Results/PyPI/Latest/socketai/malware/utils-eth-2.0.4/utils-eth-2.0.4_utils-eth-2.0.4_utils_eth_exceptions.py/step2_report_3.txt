  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for `ValidationError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no signs of data handling, external inputs, outputs, or complex logic.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1 or 1.0, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The code is purely definitional, with no operational or dynamic behavior that could pose a security risk.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since the code only defines a class with no executable or malicious code, malware score should remain 0.\n   - All reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they do not speculate about hidden behaviors or future integrations.\n   - They focus solely on the static analysis of the provided snippet.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports, all indicating no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n- No modifications or concerns are necessary based on the provided reports.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
