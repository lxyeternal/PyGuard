  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward class definition with no unusual or suspicious elements; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class definition inheriting from Exception, intended for raising validation errors. It contains only a docstring and a 'pass' statement, indicating no logic or data handling. There are no external data sources, sinks, or flows. The code is minimal, clean, and standard for defining custom exceptions in Python. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, benign class definition for handling validation errors. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and appears to be standard boilerplate code for exception handling.",
