  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains only a class definition with a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the class is a simple exception definition with no operational flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with a docstring and pass statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from Exception, serving as a custom validation error. It contains only a docstring and a pass statement, with no data handling, external interactions, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is benign and standard in Python for custom exceptions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
