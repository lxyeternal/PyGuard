  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for `ValidationError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data sources, sinks, or flows; no external interactions or data processing.\n   - The code is minimal, with only a docstring and a `pass` statement.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly state that this is benign boilerplate code for a custom exception class.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are present.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 or 1.0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature.\n     - `obfuscated`: 0, correct.\n     - `malware`: 0, correct.\n     - `securityRisk`: 0, correct.\n   - These scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining a custom exception class with no external interactions, data handling, or malicious content, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The reports' assigned scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware present.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus solely on the code snippet.\n   - Their conclusions are appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code snippet, I would maintain the scores as they are. There is no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless class definition for a custom exception.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nKeep the scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
