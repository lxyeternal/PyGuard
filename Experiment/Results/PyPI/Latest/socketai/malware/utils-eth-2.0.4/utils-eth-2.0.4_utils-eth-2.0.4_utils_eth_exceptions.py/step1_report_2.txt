  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors",
  "sources": "No data sources or external inputs are read in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist in this code",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition for a custom exception inheriting from Exception, with a docstring explaining its purpose. It does not include any logic, external data handling, or system interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this minimal class definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a benign part of a larger application for handling validation errors.",
