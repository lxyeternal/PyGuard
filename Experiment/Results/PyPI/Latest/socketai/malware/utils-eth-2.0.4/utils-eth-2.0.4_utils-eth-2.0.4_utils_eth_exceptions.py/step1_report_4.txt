  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for validation errors",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling observed",
  "anomalies": "Simple class definition with no unusual or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden functionalities",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception called ValidationError with a docstring explaining its purpose. It contains only a 'pass' statement, indicating an empty class definition. There are no data sources, sinks, or untrusted data flows. The code appears to be a standard custom exception class implementation with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves a specific purpose for validation error handling without any suspicious elements.",
