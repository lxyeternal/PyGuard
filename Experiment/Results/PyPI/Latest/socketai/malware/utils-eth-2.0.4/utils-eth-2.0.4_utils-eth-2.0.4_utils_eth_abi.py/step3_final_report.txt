  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting Ethereum ABI components into function signatures, event signatures, and generating their keccak-based selectors and log topics.",
  "sources": "Reads ABI dictionaries, specifically 'type', 'components', and 'name' fields, and input data for hashing.",
  "sinks": "Uses keccak hash function to generate 4-byte selectors and log topics from signatures and event signatures.",
  "flows": "Extracts type info from ABI, constructs signatures, hashes signatures with keccak, and slices the first 4 bytes for selectors or topics.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The use of 'del' is standard for list cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Ethereum ABI signature processing, including handling nested tuples and converting ABI definitions into function signatures. It uses a 'keccak' hash function to generate function selectors and event topics, which is typical in Ethereum tooling. The code is straightforward, with input validation for 'type' fields, and does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The cryptographic hashing is applied on trusted ABI data, and no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Ethereum ABI signature and topic generation. It contains no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero, and the low security risk score (around 0.1) reflects standard cryptographic operations on ABI data.",
