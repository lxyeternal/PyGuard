  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for Ethereum ABI signature and topic generation. It contains no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are justified as zero, and the low security risk score (around 0.1) reflects standard cryptographic operations on ABI data."
