  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for processing Ethereum ABI definitions and generating cryptographic signatures and log topics.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input dictionaries (ABI definitions) and function parameters such as event_signature strings.",
  "sinks": "The keccak hashing function is called with string inputs derived from ABI data, generating cryptographic hashes used in blockchain signatures.",
  "flows": "ABI dictionaries are processed to produce signatures, which are then hashed with keccak. The outputs are used as 4-byte selectors or log topics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. The keccak function usage is standard for Ethereum-related operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for Ethereum smart contract interaction: converting ABI components to signatures and generating hashes for event logs or function selectors. It uses straightforward string processing, dictionary access, and cryptographic hashing with keccak. The functions follow predictable patterns, with input validation for 'type' fields. No suspicious code paths, hardcoded credentials, or malicious data flows are present. All operations align with typical blockchain development practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for Ethereum ABI processing and signature/hash generation. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The implementation is standard and adheres to expected patterns for blockchain-related cryptographic functions.",
