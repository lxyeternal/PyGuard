{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to process Ethereum ABI data structures into signatures and topics using keccak hashing, primarily for generating function selectors and event topics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'abi' dictionaries, the 'event_signature' strings, and the imported 'keccak' function.",
  "sinks": "Uses keccak hash function as the sink; hashes are used for signatures and topics.",
  "flows": "Input ABI or signature strings are processed through formatting functions, then hashed with keccak to produce 4-byte selectors or log topics.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows are detected. The code performs standard ABI signature processing.",
  "analysis": "The code converts ABI descriptions and function/event signatures into hashed identifiers used in Ethereum smart contract interactions. It relies on a standard 'keccak' hash function. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. All operations are deterministic and intended for typical Ethereum tooling. No external network calls, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility for ABI signature processing with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard hashing operations to generate Ethereum function selectors and event topics.",
