      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for data formatting and transformation. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The slight security risk stems from executing user-provided formatter functions, which is standard in such utilities but should be used with trusted functions. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting typical trust considerations in data processing libraries."

This behavior indicates a high security risk and malicious intent, warranting a malware score of approximately 0.8 and a security risk score of around 0.75. The rest of the code appears benign utility code. This pattern should be flagged as malicious or at least highly suspicious for further review or removal."
