{
  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function to compute Keccak (SHA-3) hash from various input types.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'primitive', 'hexstr', 'text' provided to 'to_bytes' function, which converts data into bytes.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'to_bytes' passed to 'keccak_256', which performs hashing; no external sinks or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> 'to_bytes' conversion -> 'keccak_256' hashing -> output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a keccak hashing function and a conversion utility. It defines a wrapper that accepts various data types, converts them to bytes, and hashes them. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The design is typical for cryptographic hash wrappers. No external data sources or sinks are used that suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, benign utility for hashing data with Keccak. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues within this snippet.",
