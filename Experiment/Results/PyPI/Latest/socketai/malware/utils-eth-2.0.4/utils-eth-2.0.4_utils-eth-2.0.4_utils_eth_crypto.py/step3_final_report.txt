  "purpose": "A utility function that hashes various input types using keccak_256 after converting them to bytes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text; the external to_bytes function.",
  "sinks": "The keccak_256 hashing function; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> to_bytes conversion -> keccak_256 hashing -> output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; reliance on external to_bytes function without its implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper for keccak hashing, converting inputs to bytes and hashing. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. The only external dependency, to_bytes, could pose a risk if insecure, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The code's simplicity and the use of reputable cryptographic functions indicate a benign purpose. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cryptographic utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, considering the external utility's trustworthiness. Overall, supply chain risk is negligible.",
