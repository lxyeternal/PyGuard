  "purpose": "Provides a wrapper function for keccak hashing using the eth_hash library, converting various input types to bytes before hashing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: primitive, hexstr, text, and the imported keccak_256 function from eth_hash.auto.",
  "sinks": "The keccak_256 function which computes the hash on the byte-converted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (primitive, hexstr, text) -> to_bytes conversion -> keccak_256 hash function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual dynamic code, and no suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple wrapper around the eth_hash keccak implementation, converting various input types to bytes via to_bytes before hashing. It relies on an external library for hashing, and the conversion function is imported from a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The functionality appears standard for cryptographic hashing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, legitimate utility function for keccak hashing with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
