  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code behavior, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily composed of import statements from internal modules within the 'utils-eth' package.\n- It includes a deprecation warning for Python 2, which is standard practice.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are evident.\n- No network activity, file writes, or execution of untrusted code is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The package version is retrieved via `pkg_resources`, which is standard.\n- The code appears to serve as an initialization or utility setup script for an Ethereum-related Python library.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Importing utility functions; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (standard for import modules, minimal risk)\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, initializing utility imports.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (appropriate)\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Utility module setup; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (appropriate)\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above; utility imports and version info.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (appropriate)\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import statements for Ethereum utility functions; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (appropriate)\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Presence of malware:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Risk scores:** All are set at 0.5, which is reasonable for library import code that doesn't process untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The deprecation warning for Python 2 is standard and does not introduce security concerns.\n- No changes are necessary for the scores.\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 (standard for library initialization code, minimal risk)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard utility setup module for an Ethereum-related Python library. The current scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
