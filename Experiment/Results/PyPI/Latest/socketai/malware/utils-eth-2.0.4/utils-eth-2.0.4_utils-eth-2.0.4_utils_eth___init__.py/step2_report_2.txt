  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of import statements from the 'utils-eth' library, along with a Python version check and a deprecation warning.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The only noteworthy behavior is the Python 2 deprecation warning, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is purely import statements and a version check; **no security issues or vulnerabilities are present**.\n- The deprecation warning for Python 2 is benign and standard.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no malicious behaviors or vulnerabilities.\n- They consistently note the absence of data leaks, untrusted data handling, or external communication.\n- The reports do not overstate the security implications of the Python 2 warning, which is appropriate.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- All reports assign:\n  - **malware: 0**\n  - **obfuscated: 0**\n  - **securityRisk: 0**\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence score is 1 in all cases, which is justified given the clear analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since the code is just imports and a version warning, **risk scores should remain at 0**.\n- No hidden malicious intent, no dynamic code, no data leaks, and no external dependencies that could be exploited.\n\n### Malware score:\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- There is no malicious activity or code.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about potential vulnerabilities; they focus on what the code actually does.\n- The deprecation warning is standard and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, utility nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\nGiven the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity, I agree with the assigned scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign module setup with imports and a deprecation warning.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n- Maintain confidence at 1.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe and free of security issues.",
