{
  "purpose": "This code imports various utility functions and modules from the 'utils-eth' library for use in other parts of a larger project, mainly related to Ethereum blockchain data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input directly; imports modules and functions. Uses 'pkg_resources.get_distribution' to obtain package version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; no network, file, or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; mainly module imports and version retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and a version retrieval call. It includes a warning about Python 2 deprecation if Python 2 is detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling present. The import structure is typical for a utility library. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The only potentially suspicious aspect is the warning for deprecated Python version, which is benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard library initialization script with no malicious activity or security risks identified. It simply imports various utility functions and retrieves package version info. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
