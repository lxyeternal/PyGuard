{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the 'utils-eth' library by importing various utility modules, functions, and constants related to Ethereum operations. It also issues a deprecation warning if Python 2 is detected and retrieves the package version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules and the package version retrieval via pkg_resources",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static imports and version check",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a Python 2 deprecation warning, which is standard; no suspicious or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a version fetch, with a conditional warning for Python 2. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The deprecation warning is standard and benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup module for the 'utils-eth' library, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
