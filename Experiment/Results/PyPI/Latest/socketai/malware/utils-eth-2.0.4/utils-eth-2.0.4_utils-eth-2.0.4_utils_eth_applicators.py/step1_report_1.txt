{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying various formatters, transformations, and mappings to lists and dictionaries, mainly for data processing and formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments such as lists and dictionaries; no external input sources are directly used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved in untrusted data leaks or external communications; all data manipulations are local and in-memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments through formatter functions, with no external output or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses deprecated warnings, but nothing suspicious or malicious is evident. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data transformation functions, primarily applying formatters to lists and dicts. No external I/O, network access, or code execution features are present. The only notable aspect is the deprecation warning in combine_argument_formatters, which is benign. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is identified. The functions operate purely on passed data with no external side effects. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility library for data formatting and transformation.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code. It is a straightforward utility module focused on in-memory data transformations with no external or suspicious activities.",
