{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying formatters, key mappings, and conditional transformations to data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sequences.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from function parameters, especially lists and dictionaries passed as arguments to the functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions yield transformed data or return results directly; no sinks perform network operations, file writes, or system modifications. No untrusted data is sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting or mapping functions, with transformation logic applied locally within each function. No external data flow to network or storage is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes deprecation warnings, but no suspicious or malicious code such as hidden backdoors, network communications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are present. The code appears straightforward with standard use of decorators and functional composition.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data transformation utilities, including applying formatters at specific indices, combining multiple formatters, conditionally applying formatters, mapping dictionary keys, and applying formatters to sequences or arrays. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation indicates awareness of code lifecycle but not malicious intent. No network operations, system calls, or external dependencies with side effects are present. No suspicious behavior or malicious patterns are identified. The code functions as a data processing utility with safe, standard patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions for data formatting and transformation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates solely on in-memory data structures with no external interactions. The presence of deprecation warnings does not indicate malicious intent but suggests maintenance considerations. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with typical utility function patterns.",
