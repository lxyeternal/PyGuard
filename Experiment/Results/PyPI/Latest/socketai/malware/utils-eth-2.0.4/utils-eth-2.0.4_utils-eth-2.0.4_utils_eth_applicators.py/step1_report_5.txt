{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for applying various formatters and transformations to data structures like lists and dictionaries, primarily for data processing or formatting workflows.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters: lists, dictionaries, and callables (conditions, formatters). It does not read from external sources or network inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are where data is yielded or returned, which could be used downstream. There are no external system calls, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through transformation functions, applying formatters conditionally or by index, and yields transformed data. No external data flows or system interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. No suspicious dynamic code execution or external system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for applying formatters to data structures, with proper error handling for index and type errors. The use of warnings for deprecation is benign. All transformations are local, do not include external data or system modifications. No suspicious logic, such as network activity, file operations, or credential handling, is present. The code appears to be a set of utility functions designed for safe data formatting tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a set of data formatting utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely applies transformations to data without external interactions or potential exploits.",
