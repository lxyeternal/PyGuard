  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for data formatting and transformation. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The slight security risk stems from executing user-provided formatter functions, which is standard in such utilities but should be used with trusted functions. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting typical trust considerations in data processing libraries."
