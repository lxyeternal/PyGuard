{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for applying various formatting functions to sequences, dictionaries, and array data, mainly for data transformation and validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'value', 'sequence', 'value' (dict), and 'key_mappings'. No external input sources or user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "The code yields transformed data, raises exceptions for errors, and applies formatters or key mappings. No data is sent over networks, written to files, or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting functions, with conditional and index-based processing, and possibly raises exceptions if formatting fails or key conflicts occur.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs deprecation warnings, which are benign; no suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No obfuscated or intentionally malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily offers data formatting utilities: applying functions at specific indices, combining formatters, applying formatters to sequences, dicts, and arrays, as well as key mapping. It includes deprecation warnings indicating transition to newer functions. No external network calls, file manipulations, or system modifications are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are identified. The use of warnings and exception handling appears standard for robust data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for data formatting with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or malware indicators. It is well-structured, with no signs of sabotage or malicious payloads. The deprecation warning indicates maintenance activity rather than malicious code.",
