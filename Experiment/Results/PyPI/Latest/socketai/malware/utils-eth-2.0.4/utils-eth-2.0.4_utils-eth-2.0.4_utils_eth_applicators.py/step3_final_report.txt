  "purpose": "Utility functions for applying formatters, key mappings, and transformations to lists and dictionaries, operating solely on in-memory data.",
  "sources": "Function arguments providing data to be transformed or formatted.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures; no external I/O, network, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatter functions or mappings, yielding transformed data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecation warnings; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard data transformation utilities that operate purely on passed data. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The main potential security concern is that formatter functions are user-supplied and could be malicious if untrusted, but this is a common pattern in such utility libraries. The code itself is straightforward, with proper exception handling and no obfuscation. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The deprecation warning is benign. Overall, the code is safe, with minimal inherent security risk primarily depending on trust in external formatter functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for data formatting and transformation. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The slight security risk stems from executing user-provided formatter functions, which is standard in such utilities but should be used with trusted functions. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting typical trust considerations in data processing libraries.",
