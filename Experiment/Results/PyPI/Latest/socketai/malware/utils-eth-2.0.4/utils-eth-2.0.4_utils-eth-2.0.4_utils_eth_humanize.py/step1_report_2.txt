  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable representations of time, bytes, hashes, URIs, and sequences.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (e.g., bytes, Hash32, URI strings, integer sequences).",
  "sinks": "Output formatting; no direct data leaks or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through formatting functions to output strings; no external or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious external calls or data exfiltration methods.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various utility functions for formatting durations, byte arrays, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences into human-readable formats. Functions use standard library modules and straightforward logic. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. The functions process data and generate strings for display purposes only. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. The only external interactions are parsing URLs and validating IPFS hashes, which are standard operations. The code is well-structured and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and performs formatting tasks without side effects.",
