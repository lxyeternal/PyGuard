{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for human-readable formatting of time durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as seconds, bytes, hashes, URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned as formatted strings; no external data sinks or network transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed within functions and converted into human-readable formats without external side effects or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. All functions perform straightforward data formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that transform input data into human-friendly strings. It uses standard Python libraries and common programming constructs. No code injection, network operations, or suspicious behavior observed. The IPFS-related functions check for specific hash schemes and parse URLs without performing any malicious actions. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or dynamic code execution identified. Functions are self-contained and perform safe string manipulations and data checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely utility-oriented, designed for formatting and displaying data in a human-readable form. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious side effects. It appears safe and benign.",
