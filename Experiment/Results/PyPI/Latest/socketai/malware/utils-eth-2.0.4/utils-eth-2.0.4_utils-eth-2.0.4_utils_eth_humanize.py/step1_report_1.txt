{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for humanizing time durations, byte sequences, hashes, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function inputs such as bytes, strings, and iterables. It also parses URIs using the urlparse method.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data, network communication, or sensitive operations. The code mainly formats and processes data for display.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into formatting functions, with some parsing of URIs and byte data, but no dangerous or malicious data manipulation paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The functions perform straightforward formatting and parsing tasks without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code performs utility operations such as converting seconds to human-readable formats, truncating byte arrays and hashes for display, parsing and validating IPFS URIs, and creating concise string representations of integer sequences. All functions operate on well-defined inputs with no external system interaction or sensitive data handling. No network calls, no eval, no subprocess, no data exfiltration mechanisms, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It is purely for data formatting and validation, with proper handling of edge cases.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of formatting and parsing utilities with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates solely on input data for presentation purposes without any side effects or dangerous operations.",
