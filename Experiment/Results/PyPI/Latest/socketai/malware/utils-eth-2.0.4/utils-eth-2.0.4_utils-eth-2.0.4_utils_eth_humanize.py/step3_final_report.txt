  "purpose": "Utility functions for humanizing durations, byte sequences, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences, primarily for formatting and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as seconds, bytes, Hash32 hashes, URI strings, and integer sequences.",
  "sinks": "Formatted string outputs; no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed through validation and formatting functions, with no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs straightforward data formatting and validation without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for converting raw data into human-readable formats, including durations, byte sequences, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences. It performs validation on IPFS URIs and CIDv0 hashes, and slices byte arrays for humanization. No network calls, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The functions are simple, well-structured, and serve purely formatting purposes. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign utility nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and purely utility-oriented. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1).",
