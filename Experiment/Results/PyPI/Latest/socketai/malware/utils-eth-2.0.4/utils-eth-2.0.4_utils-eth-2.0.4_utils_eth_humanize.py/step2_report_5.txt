  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as utility functions for formatting durations, bytes, hashes, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences.\n- They emphasize the absence of network calls, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- The functions operate on well-defined inputs, produce formatted strings, and include validation where appropriate.\n- The overall confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9–1), indicating strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct and performs as described.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** No evidence of malicious behavior is present.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities or security flaws are evident based on the description.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or mistakes are apparent in the code or the reports.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- The reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- `securityRisk` scores are low (mostly 0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, aligning with the absence of obfuscation.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely for data formatting and validation, with no network activity, no data leaks, and no suspicious constructs, **a risk score higher than 0.2 would be unwarranted**.\n- The `malware` score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is identified.\n- The `obfuscated` score should stay at 0.\n\n### Potential discrepancies:\n- The first report assigns a `malware` score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The other reports also assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the detailed reviews, I concur that the code is safe and free from malicious intent.**  \n**The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.**  \n**No changes are necessary.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to the utility nature, but acknowledging that parsing URIs could be misused if misused, though no evidence here)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided reports' assessments.**  \nThe code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
