{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for humanizing durations, byte sequences, IPFS URIs, and sequences of integers for display purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant values, function parameters (bytes, Hash32, URI, integers), and external modules like 'parse' and 'toolz'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data or perform actions that could be considered sinks in a security context. It mainly processes and formats input data for display.",
  "flows": "Input data such as bytes, URIs, or integers flows through functions like humanize_bytes, humanize_hash, humanize_ipfs_uri, and humanize_seconds to produce formatted string outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The functions perform straightforward data formatting without side effects. No network calls or suspicious obfuscation are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that perform data formatting and human-readable conversions. It handles various data types including durations, byte sequences, IPFS URIs, and integer sequences. The functions rely on standard libraries and simple logic. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions are self-contained and do not perform network operations or access sensitive system data. The only potential concern could be the handling of URIs, but the code properly validates IPFS schemes and CIDv0 formats. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate, serving purely as formatting helpers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions for data formatting with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and lacks any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
