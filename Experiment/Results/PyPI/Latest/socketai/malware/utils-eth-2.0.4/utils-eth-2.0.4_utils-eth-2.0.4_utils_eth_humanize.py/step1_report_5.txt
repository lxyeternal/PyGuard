  "purpose": "Utility functions for human-readable formatting of time, bytes, hashes, URIs, and integer sequences.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions such as 'humanize_seconds', 'humanize_bytes', 'humanize_hash', 'humanize_ipfs_uri', and sequence inputs for range functions.",
  "sinks": "Formatting output strings, parsing URIs, and returning processed data; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., seconds, bytes, URIs, integer sequences) processed through formatting functions to generate human-readable strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Functions perform straightforward formatting and parsing. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no suspicious variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code provides various utility functions for converting raw data (time in seconds, bytes, IPFS URIs, sequences) into human-readable formats. All functions perform input validation, formatting, and simple parsing. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, no use of untrusted data sources beyond input parameters. The functions are purely computational, focusing on formatting and parsing, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable activity is URI parsing and validation, which is safely handled. Overall, the code appears to be benign utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of formatting and parsing utilities with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe operations, and no anomalies or suspicious activities are detected. The code is considered safe for use.",
