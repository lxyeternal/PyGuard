  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward import block with a try-except fallback between 'cytoolz' and 'toolz'.\n- No dynamic code execution, no data processing, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets.\n- The list of imported functions is extensive but standard for utility libraries.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n- The fallback mechanism is common for compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly states the code imports utility functions.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, benign, standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, security risk, or malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0 (correct)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Analysis:** Notes the extensive import list and fallback pattern. Recognizes that it might seem unusual but isn't suspicious.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — Slightly higher, perhaps due to the large import list, but still benign.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — Acceptable, given the large import list but still low.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score is slightly elevated but justified; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes the fallback pattern as standard, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros for malware and obfuscated, security risk at 0.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same conclusions, standard import pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others, standard fallback import pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, justified by the large import list but still very low.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — standard dependency import pattern, no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code snippet. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a standard, safe import pattern with fallback logic.  \n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Note:** No further security concern arises from this code snippet alone.",
