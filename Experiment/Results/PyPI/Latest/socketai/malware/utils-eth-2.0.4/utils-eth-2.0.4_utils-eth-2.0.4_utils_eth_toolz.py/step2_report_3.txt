  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a straightforward import block with a fallback mechanism.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Security risk is 0, which is reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The code only imports functions; no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, with a note that extensive imports might seem suspicious but are standard.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** The concern about the extensive import list is noted, but it’s not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0.1. The slight security risk might be due to the large import list, but it's minimal.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity detected; just a large import list which is typical in utility setup code.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Standard dependency fallback logic.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The pattern is common.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0. This aligns with benign dependency management.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The import block is straightforward.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The pattern is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0. Consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to others, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The extensive list is typical for utility modules.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated at 0, security risk at 0. The detailed reasoning supports this.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. I agree with a malware score of **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's benign nature, the risk score should be very low. The highest is 0.1 in one report, which is acceptable considering the large import list, but it does not indicate real security risk.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (minimal, likely due to the extensive import list but not indicative of real risk)\n\nThis code is a standard dependency import pattern with fallback logic, common in Python projects for compatibility. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (due to the large import list, but not a security concern)",
