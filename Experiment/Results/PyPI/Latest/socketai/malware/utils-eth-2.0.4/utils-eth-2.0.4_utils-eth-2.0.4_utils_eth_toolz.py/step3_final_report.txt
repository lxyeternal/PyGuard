{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a comprehensive set of utility functions from 'cytoolz' with a fallback to 'toolz' for compatibility, establishing a utility library dependency.",
  "sources": "The import statements are the source points, reading from the 'cytoolz' or 'toolz' modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data, execute code dynamically, or perform network operations; thus, there are no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statements; there are no data flows to external systems or untrusted data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a straightforward dependency fallback pattern with a large list of imported functions, which is typical for utility modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for importing utility functions with a fallback mechanism, involving no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. The extensive list of imports is typical for utility libraries and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The fallback approach enhances compatibility but does not introduce security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency setup pattern for importing utility functions, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0 or very low) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
