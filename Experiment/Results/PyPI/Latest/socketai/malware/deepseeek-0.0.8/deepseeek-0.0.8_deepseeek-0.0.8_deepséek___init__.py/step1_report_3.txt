  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script possibly intended for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, its purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, possibly input functions or file reads, but these are not explicitly shown or are minimal.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, or database operations if present; however, none are explicitly identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or system interaction points, but the code does not clearly demonstrate these flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are apparent. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly at all segments; no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior were identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. No malicious payloads or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to serve a legitimate purpose without any hidden or harmful intent.",
