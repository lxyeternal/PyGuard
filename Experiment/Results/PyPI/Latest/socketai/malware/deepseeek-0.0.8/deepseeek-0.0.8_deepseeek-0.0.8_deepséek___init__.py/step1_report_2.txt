  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform data processing or some form of computation. No explicit purpose can be determined from the code snippet alone.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function arguments, environment variables, and potentially from external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to the console, files, network sockets, or external services, depending on implemented functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like output functions or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident. The code uses standard libraries and patterns; no backdoors or covert channels are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure and content do not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. All dependencies are standard, and no external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent. No hardcoded secrets, eval statements, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code adheres to common coding practices, and the data flows seem legitimate based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears to be a typical Python application with no suspicious features. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
