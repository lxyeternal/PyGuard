  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on static code analysis summaries.",
  "sources": "Code inputs, environment variables, data flows from code comments; no specific code snippets provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables or external interactions, but none identified as malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from code inputs or environment variables to outputs; no suspicious or malicious flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns reported.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently describe benign, standard Python scripts with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are justified given the descriptions. High confidence levels (0.8-0.9) support the benign assessment. No code snippets suggest malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score appropriately reflects minimal concern, though static analysis cannot guarantee absolute safety. The reports are internally consistent and cautious, with no evident flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 could be considered for increased conservativeness, but 0.2 remains acceptable.",
