  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions. No clear purpose indicating malicious intent is evident from the provided code fragment.",
  "sources": "Reads data from local variables, possibly external inputs if present, but none explicitly shown. No obvious external input sources like network, files, or environment variables are detected in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no direct outputs or external sinks like network transmissions or file writes are evident in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No apparent source-to-sink data flow is visible; the code operates on local data, with no evidence of untrusted data handling or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual function calls are present. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation without malicious behavior. It contains no signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity. The absence of external data sources or sinks further reduces concern. As the code is likely a utility or processing script, it does not perform any unsafe operations or access sensitive data without context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign with no signs of malware, malicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities in this fragment.",
