The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the static and straightforward nature of the code."

Slightly lowering the security risk score to 0.1 could be considered for increased conservativeness, but 0.2 remains acceptable."

      "conclusion": "The script is primarily engaged in covert data collection and transmission, which poses significant privacy and security concerns. While it does not deliver malware payloads, its behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration activities. The malware score should be around 0.75, reflecting high potential for malicious intent, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.8 due to insecure transmission, suppression of warnings, and silent operation."
