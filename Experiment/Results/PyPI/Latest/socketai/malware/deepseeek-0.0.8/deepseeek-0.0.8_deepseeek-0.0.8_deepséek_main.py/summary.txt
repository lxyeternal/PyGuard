  "conclusion": "The script is primarily engaged in covert data collection and transmission, which poses significant privacy and security concerns. While it does not deliver malware payloads, its behavior aligns with malicious exfiltration activities. The malware score should be around 0.75, reflecting high potential for malicious intent, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.8 due to insecure transmission, suppression of warnings, and silent operation."
