  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static variables and package metadata; no untrusted input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static package information, dependencies, and a console script entry point. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The entry point references a function in the package, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. All signals point to benign, standard package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the static and straightforward nature of the code.",
