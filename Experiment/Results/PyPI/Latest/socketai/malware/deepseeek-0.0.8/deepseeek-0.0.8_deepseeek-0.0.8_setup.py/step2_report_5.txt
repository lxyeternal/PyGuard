  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static setup script for a Python package.\n- No external or untrusted input is involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The only potentially dynamic component is the entry point `deepseeek.main:main`, which is standard for console scripts, and its maliciousness cannot be assessed from this setup script alone.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- It is a typical setup.py configuration script.\n- No external data, secrets, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The entry point is a standard console script, which, unless the actual `deepseeek.main:main` function is malicious (not assessable here), does not pose a risk.\n\n### Potential issues or discrepancies:\n- The reports are consistent and do not suggest any security concern.\n- The scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all zero, which seems appropriate.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The **malware score** is correctly set to 0 because there's no malicious code.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- The **securityRisk** score is 0, as the script does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, benign package setup script.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the script is a typical setup configuration with no security issues.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
