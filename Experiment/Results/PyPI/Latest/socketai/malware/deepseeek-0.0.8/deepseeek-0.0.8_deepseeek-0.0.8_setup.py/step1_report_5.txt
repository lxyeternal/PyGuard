{
  "purpose": "Define the package configuration for the 'deepseeek' Python project, including setup parameters and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Constants and function parameters such as VERSION, package metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which registers package info and dependencies for installation.",
  "flows": "The VERSION constant flows into the version parameter; user or environment data does not influence the setup parameters directly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard package setup practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to configure package installation. It defines a version constant and calls setup() with metadata, package inclusion rules, dependencies, and entry points. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are used. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. All components are typical for Python package distribution. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
