{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package named 'deepseeek', including metadata and dependencies, to facilitate packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Constants (VERSION), imported modules (setuptools), and setup parameters (name, version, description, etc.)",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external interactions in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated elements, or suspicious behavior. All code appears standard for a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, defines a version constant, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The code strictly manages package metadata and dependencies, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
