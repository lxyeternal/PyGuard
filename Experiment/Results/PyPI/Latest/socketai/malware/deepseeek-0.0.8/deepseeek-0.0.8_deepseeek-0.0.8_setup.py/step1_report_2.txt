  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It does not contain any dynamic code, input handling, or potentially malicious constructs. The only variable is the VERSION string, which is standard for versioning and does not pose a security concern. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no malicious or suspicious content. It poses no security risks.",
