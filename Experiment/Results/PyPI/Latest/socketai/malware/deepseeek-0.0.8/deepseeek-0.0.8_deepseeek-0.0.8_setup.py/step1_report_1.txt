{
  "purpose": "Define and configure the package setup for the 'deepseeek' Python project, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration data, package requirements, and package metadata; no external or untrusted input is read.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious activity are present; setup configuration does not execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The static configuration data flows into setup functions and package metadata definitions; no runtime data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or unusual behaviors are observed. The URL field is empty, which is acceptable for a local setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It uses static data only, with no user input or untrusted data sources. The entry point is a standard console script, and dependencies are typical for a Python package. There is no code execution, data manipulation, or network activity beyond dependency declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate configuration file for distributing a Python package.",
