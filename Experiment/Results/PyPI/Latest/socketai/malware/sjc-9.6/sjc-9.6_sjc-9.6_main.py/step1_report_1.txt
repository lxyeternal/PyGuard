  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it encoded to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network info, random.randint() for generating a number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() sending data via HTTP GET request to external URLs, passing system info as URL parameters.",
  "flows": "Sources (system info and random number) are encoded and included in URL parameters, then sent via HTTP requests to external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external URLs with suspicious domains, encoding MAC addresses in base64, and sending system info to multiple third-party servers without clear purpose. The URLs are obscure and possibly malicious. The code does not validate or sanitize inputs before sending. No explicit user consent or security checks are present.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses. MAC addresses are retrieved via system commands depending on OS. The MAC addresses are encoded in base64 and sent as URL parameters to three external URLs that are suspicious, using HTTP GET requests. No input validation or user interaction occurs, and the data transmission appears to be covert, possibly tracking or exfiltration. The code does not perform any malicious actions directly on the file system, but the data exfiltration behavior and communication with suspicious domains suggest potentially malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious payload execution is present, but the data exfiltration pattern is concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs system data collection and transmits it to suspicious external URLs without user consent or validation. While it does not execute malicious payloads directly, its behavior indicates potential data exfiltration or tracking, which is suspicious. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to the covert transmission to suspicious domains.",
