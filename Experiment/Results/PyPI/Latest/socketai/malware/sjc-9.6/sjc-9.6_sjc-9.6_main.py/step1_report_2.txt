{
  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to multiple external URLs encoded in base64, possibly for tracking or reconnaissance purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), retrieves MAC addresses via subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Performs HTTP GET requests to external URLs with encoded parameters containing system information.",
  "flows": "System info is collected, encoded (MAC addresses), then included as URL parameters, and sent over HTTP GET requests to multiple external domains.",
  "anomalies": "Uses multiple external URLs that appear suspicious and unrelated to typical package functionality. Encodes MAC addresses and system info, potentially for tracking. No validation or sanitization of data before transmission. No user consent prompts or logs; data is sent automatically.",
  "analysis": "The code collects sensitive system data (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) without user consent and encodes MAC addresses in base64. It then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and makes HTTP GET requests passing the collected data as URL parameters. The URLs seem to be part of a tracking or reconnaissance infrastructure, not related to any legitimate package functionality. No malicious system modifications or backdoors are evident, but the data exfiltration behavior indicates privacy violations and potential surveillance.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs automatic collection and transmission of system information to external, suspicious domains, which is indicative of tracking or reconnaissance activities. There is no indication of malicious payloads like system damage or backdoors, but the behavior is privacy-intrusive and potentially malicious in intent.",
