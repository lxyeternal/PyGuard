  "purpose": "Collect system information such as hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, then send this data to remote URLs encoded with a base64 version of the MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function reading system network info, and random.randint() for generating identifiers.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() to send data to external URLs.",
  "flows": "Collects hostname, username, directory, and MAC addresses; encodes MAC addresses in base64; constructs URLs with these parameters; sends data via HTTP GET requests.",
  "anomalies": "Uses external URLs that appear suspicious and obscure (oast domains), encodes MAC addresses in base64 potentially for obfuscation, and sends data without validation or encryption. No explicit hardcoded credentials, but the URL patterns and data collection behavior are suspicious. No malicious payloads or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system info including MAC addresses, encodes them, and transmits this data to multiple external URLs. These URLs are hosted on suspicious domains that resemble malicious infrastructure (oast domains often used for tracking or testing). The code does not perform any malicious activity directly but is designed to exfiltrate system identifiers, which is characteristic of tracking or reconnaissance behavior. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious payload, or malicious commands. The usage of base64 encoding might be an attempt to hide data content. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious code constructs, but its intent to collect and send system info to untrusted endpoints raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is collecting system information and exfiltrating it to suspicious URLs, which could be used for tracking or reconnaissance. No direct malware behavior detected, but the data exfiltration to untrusted endpoints is suspicious. Overall, it exhibits potentially malicious behavior primarily due to data collection and transmission to suspicious domains.",
