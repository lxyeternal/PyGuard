      "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits a high-risk pattern by executing 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' is compromised. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.75, security risk ~0.8) are appropriate. Caution is advised, and the 'main' module should be reviewed before trusting or deploying this package."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily performing covert data exfiltration of system identifiers to suspicious external domains. While it does not execute malicious payloads or system modifications, its behavior is privacy-invasive and potentially malicious in a supply chain context. The malware score should be low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the absence of active malicious payloads, but the security risk score should be high (around 0.75), due to covert exfiltration activity. The obfuscation is minimal, with base64 encoding, which is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code's behavior warrants caution and high security alertness, but it does not constitute malware payloads per se."
