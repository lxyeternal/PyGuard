{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'sjc' that installs dependencies and executes a main function after installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data sources during execution; it primarily imports modules and calls a function from 'main'.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'main()' from 'main', which could potentially execute arbitrary code if 'main' contains malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone.",
  "flows": "The setup process involves executing the custom install class 'CrazyInstallStrat', which then calls 'main()' from 'main'. Data flow is limited to module imports and function calls; no external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The custom install class executes 'main()' unconditionally after installation, which is unusual for setup scripts. The 'main' function's source and behavior are unknown, raising concern over potential malicious behavior. No other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom installation class that runs 'main()' from 'main' module during installation. This could be exploited to execute arbitrary code if 'main' contains malicious logic. The setup process itself is standard but the automatic invocation of 'main()' during install is suspicious. No external input, secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code's primary concern lies in executing 'main()' at install time, which could be malicious if 'main' is compromised or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script executes 'main()' from 'main' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' is malicious. No other malicious behaviors or security risks are evident in this snippet, but the automatic execution warrants caution.",
