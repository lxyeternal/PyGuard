  "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits a high-risk pattern by executing 'main()' during installation, which could be malicious if 'main' is compromised. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.75, security risk ~0.8) are appropriate. Caution is advised, and the 'main' module should be reviewed before trusting or deploying this package."
