  "purpose": "Importing the 'perm' object or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file named 'main.py' or a similarly named package component.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are observable from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any anomalies; it is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "This code performs a standard import operation from a relative module, which is common in Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behaviors. As it is a single line, there are no hidden flows or suspicious patterns. Since it only imports 'perm' from 'main', unless the 'main' module itself is malicious, this line is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger program and on its own is safe.",
