  "purpose": "Importing the 'perm' attribute or function from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'perm' from a relative module, which does not involve data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident in this single line of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual features or signs of obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports 'perm' from a local module 'main'. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs present. As this is a minimal import statement, it does not pose an immediate security risk by itself. Without additional context or code, it is not possible to identify malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and typical for Python module imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues based solely on this line.",
