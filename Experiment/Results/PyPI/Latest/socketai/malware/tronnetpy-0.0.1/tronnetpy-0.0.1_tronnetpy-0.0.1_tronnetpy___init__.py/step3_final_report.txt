  "purpose": "This code imports the 'perm' object from a local module named 'main'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'main' module relative to the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects are present; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The import loads 'main' and makes 'perm' available in the current namespace; no data flows or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of external effects. Given the limited context, no further concerns are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
