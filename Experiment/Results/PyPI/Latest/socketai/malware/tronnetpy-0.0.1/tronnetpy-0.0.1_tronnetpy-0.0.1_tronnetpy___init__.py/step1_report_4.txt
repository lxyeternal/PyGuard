  "purpose": "Import the 'perm' object or function from the local module 'main'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of context; the import statement itself is benign. No suspicious or unusual code constructs or hardcoded secrets are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a standard import of 'perm' from a relative module 'main'. This is a common practice in Python projects to organize code. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or data leaks. Without additional context or code, it's impossible to identify malicious intent or security issues from this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal component of a larger codebase.",
