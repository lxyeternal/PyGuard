  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report to ensure consistency, accuracy, and appropriateness of the scores.\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**\n   - All reports describe a straightforward import statement: `from .main import perm`.\n   - The code is minimal, does not execute any logic, and does not interact with external systems or data.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:**\n   - No report indicates any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious payloads.\n   - The code appears standard for Python projects, with no signs of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n3. **Scores Analysis:**\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n   - **Malware Score:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of any malicious indicators.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Mostly very low (0 or 0.1). Given the import alone, this is appropriate. Importing a module isn't inherently risky unless the module itself is malicious, which cannot be inferred here.\n\n4. **Confidence Levels:**\n   - High confidence (1.0) in most reports, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature.\n   - Slightly lower in some reports (0.9), still acceptable.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies & Justifications:**\n   - The only point to consider is the **securityRisk** score of 0.1 in some reports. Since the import line itself is benign, this could be lowered to 0 unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n   - The **malware** scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency & Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports are consistent with each other.\n   - The scores align with the analysis that the code is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the import alone, a very low risk score (0 or 0.1) is reasonable. No evidence suggests higher risk.\n\n### My Overall Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, just for conservative safety, but effectively negligible)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code snippet. No adjustments needed unless further context indicates otherwise.",
