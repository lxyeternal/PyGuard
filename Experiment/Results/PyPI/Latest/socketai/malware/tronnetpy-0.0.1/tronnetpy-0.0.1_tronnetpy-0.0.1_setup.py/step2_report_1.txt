  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly describe the code as a standard, benign Python setup script using setuptools.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are identified.\n- No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code reads a local README.md for description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, author info, and project URL.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a security risk of 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (1.0 or 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior. The logic matches the code provided.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or mistakes are apparent. The code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — No malicious activity or code.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n  - **Risk:** 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risks identified.\n\n### Potential Concerns:\n- The email address `'qutyjeje@joliys.pro'` is unconventional and appears random or non-standard, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. It could be a placeholder or a pseudonymous contact.\n- The project URL points to a GitHub repository, but no suspicious activity or malware is implied.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a benign setup script.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made beyond what the code shows.\n- The scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Keep at **0**.\n\nThe code is a standard, safe package setup script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
