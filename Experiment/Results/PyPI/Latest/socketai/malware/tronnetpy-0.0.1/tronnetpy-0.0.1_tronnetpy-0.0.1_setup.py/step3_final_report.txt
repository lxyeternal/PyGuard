  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a library, reading README.md for description, and specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata including name, version, author, email, license, URL; uses find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data or user input handling; no network or file operations beyond static setup.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from local README.md to long_description; package metadata assigned directly; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional email address 'qutyjeje@joliys.pro' noted but not suspicious; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard setup script with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. All five reviews correctly identify it as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is solely to package a Python library, and it does so in a typical manner. The provided code and reports are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk. The reports are accurate, and no improvements are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
