{
  "purpose": "This code provides Windows console manipulation functionalities such as changing text attributes, cursor positioning, and console titles, mainly for enhancing terminal output display.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information via WinDLL functions, specifically from kernel32.dll such as GetStdHandle, GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, and SetConsoleMode.",
  "sinks": "The functions interact with system console handles and modify console display properties. No direct sink involving untrusted data, user input, or network activity is present.",
  "flows": "The code obtains system console handles, retrieves console info, modifies console attributes, cursor position, and titles through function calls that manipulate the console state via system API functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no indications of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code performs standard console manipulation tasks with proper API usage. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes console API functions, checks for environment support, and provides utility functions for console info retrieval and manipulation. It uses ctypes to load Windows API functions, with error handling for missing or incompatible DLLs. All functions serve legitimate console management purposes. No external data sources or outputs are involved that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity. The code strictly interacts with local system APIs without any network or data exfiltration logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Windows console handling utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical implementation of console API functions for display management.",
