  "purpose": "Provides Windows console manipulation functions via system DLLs, enabling control over console display attributes, cursor position, title, and buffer info.",
  "sources": "Reads console handle information, console buffer info, and system API calls for console control.",
  "sinks": "Modifies console display attributes, cursor position, and title; interacts with system console handles.",
  "flows": "API functions read console handle info and write console attributes, cursor position, and title; no untrusted data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; uses standard Windows API calls for legitimate purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around Windows console API functions, with proper error handling and platform support fallbacks. It does not process untrusted input, nor does it perform network operations or data exfiltration. The functions serve legitimate purposes such as changing console colors, cursor position, and title. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console utility module with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
