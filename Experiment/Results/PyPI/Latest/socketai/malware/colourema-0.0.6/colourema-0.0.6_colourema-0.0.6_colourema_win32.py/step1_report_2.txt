{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for interacting with the Windows console, including changing text attributes, cursor positions, console titles, and retrieving console information.",
  "sources": "The code reads system handles for stdout and stderr via _GetStdHandle; it also reads environment and system info via Windows API functions.",
  "sinks": "Functions that can modify console display attributes, cursor position, or title which could be used maliciously to manipulate user interface, but not to leak data or execute malicious actions directly.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves console handles, reads console info, and sets console properties based on input parameters, mainly via API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is focused solely on Windows console manipulation using standard APIs. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Windows console utility module, making use of ctypes to access Windows API functions. It includes checks for the presence of ctypes, loads necessary functions, and defines helper functions for console operations. The functions appear safe and typical for console handling, with no indications of malicious intent. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network operations. The structure is clear and matches standard usage of Windows console APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for Windows console interactions. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. It solely interacts with system console features for display and control purposes, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
