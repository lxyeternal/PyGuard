  "conclusion": "The package contains legitimate terminal handling code but embeds a heavily obfuscated payload in deinit() that executes dynamically decoded code via eval. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious intent or backdoor, warranting caution. The high obfuscation and eval usage justify high malware and risk scores. It is recommended to deobfuscate the payload to verify its content before trusting or deploying this package."
