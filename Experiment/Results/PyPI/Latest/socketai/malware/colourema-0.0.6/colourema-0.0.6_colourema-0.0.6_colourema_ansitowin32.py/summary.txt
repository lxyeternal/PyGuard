  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for handling terminal ANSI sequences on Windows. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The minimal risk stems from the inherent capability of ANSI sequences to manipulate terminal appearance, but this is a known, non-malicious feature. The scores should be adjusted to malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk approximately 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting the low, inherent risk without malicious intent."
