{
  "purpose": "The code manages ANSI escape sequences and converts or strips them for Windows terminal compatibility, acting as a wrapper around output streams such as stdout or stderr.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include calls to the write() method, and reading from environment variables (os.environ), file descriptors, and stream properties.",
  "sinks": "Data output occurs through wrapped streams (stdout, stderr), with potential for data manipulation or redirection within write() and write_and_convert().",
  "flows": "Data flows from write() or write_and_convert() (source) to the wrapped stream (sink), with internal processing involving regex matching and conditional ANSI sequence conversion or stripping.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network activity are detected. The code performs terminal output formatting and conversion, which is standard. No obfuscated code, malicious file access, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements stream wrapping and ANSI sequence handling for terminal compatibility, including on Windows systems. It uses regex to parse ANSI sequences and optionally converts or strips them. The conversion functions interact with Windows API calls to change terminal colors or cursor positions via winterm. No external network connections, file manipulations, or data exfiltration behaviors are present. The code operates solely on terminal output streams, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. Its purpose is purely formatting and compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard terminal formatting utility code with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It handles ANSI sequences and Windows terminal compatibility without external data leaks or harmful actions.",
