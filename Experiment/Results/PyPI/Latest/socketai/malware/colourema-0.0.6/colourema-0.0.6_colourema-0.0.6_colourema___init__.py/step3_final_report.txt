  "purpose": "Module initialization for a terminal styling library, importing styling functions and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import statements and version assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; straightforward import and version declaration, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, a version string, and a license comment. There are no data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or setup file. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is to initialize the module with styling functions, which is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: near zero) are consistent with this benign assessment. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for a terminal styling library with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
