  "purpose": "Unit tests for ANSI color code definitions and their attributes in the 'ansi' module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, unittest, and local modules; usage of sys.stdout and sys.stderr for environment checks.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data leaks, network operations, or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily assertions and environment checks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard testing libraries and local modules for ANSI escape code definitions. It performs environment checks to ensure stdout and stderr are not wrapped by AnsiToWin32. The tests verify that specific ANSI escape sequences match expected strings for foreground, background, and style attributes. No data input, network communication, or system modification occurs. The code is straightforward, intended for testing ANSI color code constants, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of unit tests validating ANSI escape sequence constants. It performs no harmful actions or malicious behaviors, and there are no security concerns.",
