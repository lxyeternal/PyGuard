{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for ANSI escape code attributes and ensuring proper setup/teardown of sys.stdout and sys.stderr in the ansi package.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, unittest, and internal module imports (..ansi and ..ansitowin32). No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs attribute checks and setup/teardown operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code strictly consists of test cases verifying ANSI escape sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite verifying the correctness of ANSI escape sequences for foreground, background, and style attributes. It uses only in-memory checks and standard library features. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or insecure practices. No external data or network operations are performed. The test ensures ANSI codes are correctly defined and that sys.stdout and sys.stderr are restored after tests, which is typical for test isolation. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. It verifies ANSI escape code constants and proper test setup/teardown procedures. No signs of malware or security threats detected.",
