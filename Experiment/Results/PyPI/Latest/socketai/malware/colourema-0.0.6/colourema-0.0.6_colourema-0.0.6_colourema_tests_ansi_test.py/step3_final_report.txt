{
  "purpose": "This code is a set of unit tests verifying static ANSI escape sequence constants for foreground, background, and style attributes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it accesses predefined constants within the module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data; the code only performs assertions on static string constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply compares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static test suite verifying ANSI escape sequence constants. It does not involve dynamic code execution, external data, or system modifications. The environment setup and teardown ensure no interference with system state. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The assertions are on predefined constants, and no data flows or external effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for testing static ANSI escape sequences, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
