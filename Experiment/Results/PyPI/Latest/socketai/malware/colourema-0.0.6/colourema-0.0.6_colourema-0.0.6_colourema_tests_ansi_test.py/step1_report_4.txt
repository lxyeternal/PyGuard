  "purpose": "Unit testing for ANSI escape code attributes and terminal behavior handling in the 'ansi' and 'ansitowin32' modules.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout and sys.stderr, imported modules 'ansi' and 'ansitowin32'. No external or untrusted input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs assertions and restores original sys.stdout/stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. The code is a standard test suite.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard testing modules and custom modules for ANSI codes. It performs assertion checks on color and style constants, verifying their values. It also ensures sys.stdout and sys.stderr are unwrapped before tests and restores them afterward. The code contains no network activity, file operations, or external data handling. It is purely a test suite for ANSI color codes and terminal behaviors, with no malicious or suspicious components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, safe test suite for verifying ANSI escape code constants. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
