  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for verifying ANSI escape sequences for text styling in terminal output.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys, unittest modules, and internal ANSI style definitions",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or external output manipulation detected",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; test assertions verify constant values of style codes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward unit testing of ANSI style constants, verifying that predefined style variables match expected escape sequences. It uses standard Python modules and internal style definitions. No input/output from external sources, no code execution or data manipulation, no suspicious behaviors or malicious code patterns. The code structure and usage are typical for test modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign unit test suite verifying ANSI style constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
