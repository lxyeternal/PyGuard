  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape codes for coloring and formatting terminal output, including cursor movements and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions for color and style codes, function parameters for title, mode, and cursor movement values.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations that generate ANSI escape sequences; functions returning these sequences for terminal control.",
  "flows": "Class attributes are used to generate escape sequences via code_to_chars, which are then returned or assigned as instance attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No external data inputs, network calls, or environment variable usage. No obfuscated or misleading code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor control. It uses straightforward string concatenation and attribute handling. No external data input, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be a standard implementation for terminal coloring, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and does not perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and solely intended for terminal display enhancements.",
