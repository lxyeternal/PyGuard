{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for coloring terminal output and controlling cursor position.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only defines constants and functions for terminal formatting.",
  "targets": "The functions generate ANSI escape sequences; these sequences are intended for terminal display purposes and do not interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the functions produce static or parameterized escape sequences without external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code consists of standard ANSI escape code generation and class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, functions, and classes for terminal text formatting using ANSI escape sequences. It uses standard string concatenation and class attribute wrapping without dynamic code execution or data manipulation. No input handling or network activity is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are evident. The implementation appears straightforward and standard for terminal styling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for generating ANSI escape codes for terminal text styling and cursor control. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module.",
