  "purpose": "Generate ANSI escape sequences for coloring and formatting terminal output",
  "sources": "Constants and functions that generate ANSI codes; class attributes defining color and style codes",
  "sinks": "Functions returning ANSI escape sequences; class attribute assignments",
  "flows": "Constants and class attributes -> functions like code_to_chars -> generated escape sequences",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. No use of dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for terminal color and cursor formatting using ANSI escape codes. The functions generate escape sequences based on standard terminal codes, with no user input or external data processed. The class structures initialize attributes with these escape sequences upon instantiation, which is standard practice for such utilities. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for terminal formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides terminal color and cursor formatting functions and classes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical implementation for ANSI code generation, with no indications of malware or security concerns.",
