{
  "purpose": "The module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text styling and cursor positioning, allowing colored and styled terminal output.",
  "sources": "The code defines static constants and functions; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no external data is processed or output in a manner that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions simply return string escape sequences based on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, using fixed escape sequences and constants. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code is present. No suspicious or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides classes and functions for ANSI terminal styling, including colors, styles, and cursor movements. It uses standard escape sequences with no external input, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. All code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. It serves purely for terminal styling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for terminal styling with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not process untrusted data, connect to networks, or perform any system-altering operations.",
