  "purpose": "Provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal styling, including colors, styles, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "Constants defining ANSI codes, functions returning escape sequences, class attributes for styling codes.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "Functions generate escape sequences based on parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module for generating ANSI escape sequences used for terminal text styling and cursor control. It defines constants and functions that produce escape sequences without processing external input, executing dynamic code, or performing network operations. The classes encapsulate styling codes, and the functions assemble escape sequences based on parameters. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, readable, and aligns with standard practices for terminal styling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for terminal styling with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unwarranted; the risk should be considered zero, as the code does not facilitate any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
