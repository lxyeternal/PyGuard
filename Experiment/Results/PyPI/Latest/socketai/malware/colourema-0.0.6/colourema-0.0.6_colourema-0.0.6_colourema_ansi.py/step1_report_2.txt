{
  "purpose": "Generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting and cursor control",
  "sources": "Definitions of ANSI code sequences, functions returning escape sequences, class attributes defining color and style codes",
  "sinks": "Functions that produce terminal escape sequences, which are generally safe; no untrusted input handling or external data sources present",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from input to output; code only defines constants and functions for formatting terminal output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded escape sequences and color codes are standard for terminal control; no suspicious code behavior or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions and classes for ANSI escape codes used in terminal formatting. It includes methods to generate sequences for cursor movement, screen clearing, and text coloring. There is no input handling, network communication, or external data processing. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic are present. The structure is straightforward, and the implementation adheres to standard practices for terminal control codes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for terminal text formatting using ANSI escape sequences. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies. Overall, it is a safe and standard implementation for its purpose.",
