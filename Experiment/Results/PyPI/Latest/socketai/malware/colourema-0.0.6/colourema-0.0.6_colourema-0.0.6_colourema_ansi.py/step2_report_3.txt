  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code in detail.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code consists solely of functions and classes that generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, including colors, styles, cursor movement, and screen clearing.\n- There is no input handling, network activity, or external data processing.\n- The constants and functions are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a standard utility module for terminal styling.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No anomalies, benign, standard ANSI code generation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues detected. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; no suspicious behavior, standard implementation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; straightforward ANSI escape code utility.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Again, standard ANSI code generator, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar, with a note on `securityRisk` being 0.1, but still no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The slight security risk score (0.1) seems to reflect a very minimal concern, possibly due to the fact that the code generates escape sequences that could, in theory, be used maliciously if misused. However, the code itself does not contain any malicious logic or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis & Final Justification:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is a benign ANSI escape code utility.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected.\n- **Scores consistency:** All malware scores are 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Risk scores:** The overall risk is minimal; the only slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) in Report 5 is justifiable as a very minor potential concern, but not indicative of actual malicious behavior.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** None are based on assumptions; the code does not process untrusted input or perform unsafe operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n**Estimated scores for the code:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. No modifications or security concerns are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe entire set of reports correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and the code is safe for use in terminal applications.",
