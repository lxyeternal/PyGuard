  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code's security implications step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states the code is a benign utility for generating ANSI escape codes, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No external input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Comments:** The report is accurate; the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's utility nature, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** No input handling, no external data, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, justified.\n- **Comments:** The assessment aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is standard for terminal styling, with no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward constants and functions, no external data, no dynamic execution.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Comments:** Correct evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—benign terminal styling utility.\n- **Analysis:** No data leaks, no unsafe operations.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Comments:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also states the code is standard, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** No external data, no obfuscation, no malicious code, but assigns a **securityRisk** score of **0.1**.\n- **Observation:** Given the code's nature, the **securityRisk** score should be **0**. The minimal risk might be considered negligible, but since there's no vulnerability or risk present, it should be zero.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Comments:** The slight non-zero securityRisk score appears unjustified. It should be adjusted to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No issues are present. The code is a straightforward ANSI escape code generator.\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, except report 5, which should also be 0.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain any malicious logic.\n- It is a utility module for terminal styling, widely used and well-understood.\n- No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present.\n- The minimal security risk is appropriate for such utility code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Adjusted Scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | **0** (was 0.1, now corrected) |\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:** The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores should all be zero, reflecting its safe utility nature.",
