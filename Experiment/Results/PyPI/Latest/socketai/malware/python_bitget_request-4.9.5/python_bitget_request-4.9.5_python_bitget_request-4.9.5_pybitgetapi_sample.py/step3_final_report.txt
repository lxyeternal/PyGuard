{
  "purpose": "A simple addition function that returns the sum of two inputs.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'a' and 'b' as input sources.",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs the result; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' flow directly to the return statement without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic addition function with no external dependencies, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. It reads inputs from parameters and outputs their sum directly. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external calls or complex logic indicate a benign utility function. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscation score of 0 are consistent with the code's behavior. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward addition function with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
