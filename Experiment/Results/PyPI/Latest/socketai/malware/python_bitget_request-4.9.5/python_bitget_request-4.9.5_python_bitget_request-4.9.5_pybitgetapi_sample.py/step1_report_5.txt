  "purpose": "Simple addition function for mathematical operations",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b'",
  "sinks": "Return statement output",
  "flows": "Input 'a' and 'b' flow directly to the output via addition",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'add' that returns the sum of two parameters. There are no input/output operations beyond function parameters, no external data reads, and no suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign addition function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
