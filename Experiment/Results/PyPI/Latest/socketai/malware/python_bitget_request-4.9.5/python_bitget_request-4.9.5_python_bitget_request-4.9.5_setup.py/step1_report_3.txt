{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup process for a Python package named 'python-bitget-request'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package description from 'README.md' via open().",
  "sinks": "The only file operation is reading the README.md; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The source (reading 'README.md') does not flow into any sensitive sink; it's a safe read operation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() to read 'README.md' is standard; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration for packaging a Python project. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. The only notable operation is reading a Markdown file for long description, which is standard practice. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. No external inputs or untrusted data processing is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It appears safe and legitimate for its intended purpose.",
