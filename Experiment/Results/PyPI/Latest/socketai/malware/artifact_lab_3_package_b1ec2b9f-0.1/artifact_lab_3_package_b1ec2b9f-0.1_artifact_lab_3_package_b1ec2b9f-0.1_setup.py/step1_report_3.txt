  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The entire code reads static data such as package name, version, and dependencies from the script itself.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted or external data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely specifies package setup information.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools functions and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It uses find_packages() to locate package modules. The dependencies listed are standard Python packages with version constraints. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or insecure practices are evident. The structure is typical for a Python package setup file. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup configuration script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
