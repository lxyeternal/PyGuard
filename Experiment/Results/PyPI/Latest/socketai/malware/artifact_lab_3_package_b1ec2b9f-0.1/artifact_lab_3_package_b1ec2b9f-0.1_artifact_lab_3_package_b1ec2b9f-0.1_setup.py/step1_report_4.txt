  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package distribution, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "User input for package requirements and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Installation process using specified dependencies, potentially vulnerable to malicious dependencies if any are compromised.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'install_requires' flows into package installation; package metadata is used during distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard 'setuptools' functions and straightforward dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package using 'setuptools'. It specifies package name, version, and dependencies. No suspicious or malicious patterns, such as malicious code injection, backdoors, or hidden behaviors, are present. The dependencies listed are standard, and there are no indications of obfuscated or suspicious code segments. The script does not perform any network activity, data collection, or other potentially malicious actions. Its purpose is solely to configure packaging parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
