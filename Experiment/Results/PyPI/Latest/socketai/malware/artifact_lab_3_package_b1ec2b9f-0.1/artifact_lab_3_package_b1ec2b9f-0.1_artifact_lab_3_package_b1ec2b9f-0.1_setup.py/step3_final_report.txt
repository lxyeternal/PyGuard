  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static code reading package name, version, packages via find_packages(), and dependencies; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no code execution, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration without dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with a package name that appears generic or hash-like but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup.py script with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The package name's randomness does not imply malicious intent. Dependency usage is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (around 0.05-0.1), mainly due to the package name. Confidence in benign assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or assessments are necessary.",
