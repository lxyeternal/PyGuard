  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to a suspicious URL, with no obfuscation. The scores should reflect high maliciousness and security risk, with malware score around 0.9 and risk score around 0.9. The behavior is consistent with data theft malware, and the assessment is justified."
