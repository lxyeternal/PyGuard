{
  "purpose": "The code collects environment variables, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to an external URL.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed through os.environ",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to an external domain with encoded environment data",
  "flows": "os.environ -> encode to ASCII -> base64 encode -> send via requests.post to external URL",
  "anomalies": "The code exfiltrates environment variables without any validation or user interaction; the target URL appears suspicious and non-standard.",
  "analysis": "The script captures all environment variables as a string, encodes them into ASCII, then base64 encodes this data, and finally transmits it via an HTTP POST request to a remote server. The use of a suspicious domain (oast.fun) suggests potential malicious intent, such as data exfiltration. There are no input validations, user prompts, or other security measures, indicating an automated or malicious data theft behavior. The code is straightforward but designed to secretly send system info externally.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears malicious as it secretly collects and exfiltrates environment variables to a suspicious external server. The lack of user interaction and the nature of the target URL suggest malicious intent, possibly for data theft or system reconnaissance.",
