  "purpose": "Collects and encodes environment variables, then sends them via an HTTP POST request to a specified URL.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables from os.environ.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over the network using requests.post to an external URL.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are encoded and transmitted to an external server via HTTP POST.",
  "anomalies": "The code encodes environment variables and exfiltrates them to a potentially suspicious external URL; the URL appears to be a dynamic or non-standard domain, possibly for command-and-control or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves all environment variables, encodes them in base64, and then posts them to an external server. This pattern indicates potential data exfiltration, as environment variables may contain sensitive information such as credentials or system details. The URL used is suspicious and could be part of a malicious activity. No user input is involved; the code runs automatically, exfiltrating system info without user consent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by exfiltrating environment variables to an external, suspicious domain. It appears designed for data theft or covert communication, indicating high malicious intent.",
