{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a sample or template for analyzing Python code for security issues, malicious behavior, and supply chain risks. It is structured as a security review utility.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imports, potential environment variables, and possibly external inputs if present (though none are explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include any use of network connections, file operations, or environment variables, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Since the code is a static analysis template, there are no active data flows from source to sink present in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a boilerplate or template with no actual functional logic; no anomalies or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a placeholder or template for conducting a security review, not executable or functional code. It lacks input handling, data processing, or any operations that could be exploited. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors visible. The structure emphasizes identifying sources, sinks, and data flows, but none are present in this snippet. Therefore, it does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. It serves as a guideline for code review rather than an actual package or script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-functional template for security analysis and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It provides a framework for assessing real code but does not itself pose any security risks.",
