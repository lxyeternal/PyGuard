  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, module imports, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential system or network calls, data leaks, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, args) to processing functions, possibly leading to dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected; lack of concrete malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify minimal or benign code with appropriate scoring. Reports 1 and 2 show no suspicious activity, with moderate confidence and low malware risk. Report 3 mentions suspicion but lacks concrete evidence; thus, its malware score should be lowered from 0.3 to 0.2 to reflect uncertainty. Reports 4 and 5 correctly note insufficient or non-functional code, warranting zero scores for malware and obfuscation. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, with the main adjustment being the reduction of Report 3's malware score due to lack of concrete suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports. The suspicion in Report 3 is overstated without actual code evidence; therefore, its malware score should be lowered. All other scores are appropriate. Overall, the security posture is low risk, with minimal likelihood of malicious activity.",
