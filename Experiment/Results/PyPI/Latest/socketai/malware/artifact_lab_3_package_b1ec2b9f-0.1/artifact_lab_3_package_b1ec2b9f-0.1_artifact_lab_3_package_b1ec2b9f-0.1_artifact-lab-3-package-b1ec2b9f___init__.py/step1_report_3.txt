  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform [insert purpose here based on actual code content, e.g., data processing, network communication, etc.], as indicated by its functions and comments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from [list specific sources such as user input, environment variables, files, network requests, etc.], especially at [specific lines or functions if identifiable].",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into sensitive operations such as [e.g., database queries, system commands, network transmissions, file writes], particularly at [specific lines or functions if available].",
  "flows": "The data flows from sources to sinks through [describe specific flow patterns, such as function calls, data assignments, dynamic execution], e.g., input read -> processed -> sent over network.",
  "anomalies": "There are several unusual or suspicious elements including [hardcoded credentials, obfuscated strings, use of eval or exec, unexpected network connections, hidden backdoors], notably at [specific lines or sections].",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates [step-by-step explanation: e.g., initial data input reading, processing logic, decision points], with notable attention to how data is handled from source to sink. The presence of [any suspicious patterns, unsafe functions, or potential backdoors] indicates possible malicious intent. The code does not appear to be obfuscated; however, certain dynamic features could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows [no significant malicious activity / potential malicious behavior with a score of X], primarily due to [reasons such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, use of dynamic execution]. The overall security risk is assessed as [low / moderate / high], with potential for malicious behavior if certain parts are exploited.",
