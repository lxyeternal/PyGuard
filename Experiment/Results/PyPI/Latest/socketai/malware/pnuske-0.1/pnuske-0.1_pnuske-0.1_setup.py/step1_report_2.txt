  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'pnuske' Python project, defining package metadata, entry points, and including all sub-packages.",
  "sources": "Import of setuptools module, find_packages() to gather packages, and setup() call with package info and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data; the script only defines static package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script does not process runtime data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools module and calls setup() with static parameters for package name, version, packages, and console script entry point. It uses find_packages() to include all sub-packages. The entry point defines a console script that executes 'pnuske.main:run'. The script is typical for packaging Python modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
