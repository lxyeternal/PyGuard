  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pnuske' Python package, defining package metadata and entry point for command-line execution.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package name, version, packages to include, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no external data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink within this script.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The entry point references 'pnuske.main:run', which is typical for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata, find packages automatically, and set up a console script entry point. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports, no handling of untrusted input. The referenced 'pnuske.main:run' function is standard for CLI applications, assuming it is implemented securely within the package. The code appears to be a straightforward setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
