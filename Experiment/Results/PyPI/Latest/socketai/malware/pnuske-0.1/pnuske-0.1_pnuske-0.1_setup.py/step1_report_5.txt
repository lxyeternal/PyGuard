  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and installing the 'pnuske' Python project, defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "import statements for 'setuptools' functions; data within 'setup()' function such as 'name', 'version', 'packages', and 'entry_points'.",
  "sinks": "The 'entry_points' setting, which could execute 'pnuske.main:run' when the command line tool is invoked.",
  "flows": "The 'entry_points' defines a source-to-sink flow: user runs 'pnuske' command -> invokes 'pnuske.main:run' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to facilitate package setup. It specifies package metadata including name and version. It dynamically finds packages via 'find_packages()'. It defines a console script entry point that maps the command 'pnuske' to the function 'run' inside 'pnuske.main' module. No code execution, external data handling, or obfuscated elements are present. The entry point could execute user-defined code, but this is standard for Python packages and does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It simply defines how the package should be installed and invoked. There are no anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
