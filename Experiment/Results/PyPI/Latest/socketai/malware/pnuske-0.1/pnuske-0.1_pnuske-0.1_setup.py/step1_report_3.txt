  "purpose": "Setuptools setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'pnuske'.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata and entry points for creating installable distribution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions from setuptools, defines package metadata such as name and version, and specifies packages via find_packages(). It also defines a console script entry point pointing to 'pnuske.main:run'. All constructs are standard for Python packaging and do not involve any suspicious behavior or malicious intent. There are no hidden or obfuscated elements, no external data leaks, and no dynamic code execution beyond standard setup script usage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script used for packaging a Python project. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and appears safe.",
