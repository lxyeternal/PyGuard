{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'pnuske', defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package setup parameters and dynamically finds packages to include.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; no user input handling or data output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears to be standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script uses setuptools to define package metadata and entry points, employing find_packages() to include all sub-packages. It sets up a console script entry point that executes 'pnuske.main:run'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, and no obfuscation or malware signals are detected.",
