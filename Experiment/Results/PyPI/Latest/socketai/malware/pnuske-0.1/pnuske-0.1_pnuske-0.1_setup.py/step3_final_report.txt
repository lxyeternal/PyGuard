  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, including an entry point for CLI execution.",
  "sources": "The setup() function parameters, including find_packages() and entry_points with 'pnuske=pnuske.main:run'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data handling, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Invocation of 'pnuske.main:run' when the CLI command 'pnuske' is executed; no other data flows or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It imports setuptools, discovers packages with find_packages(), and defines a console script entry point. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The entry point references a function that will execute when the CLI command is run, which is standard for CLI tools. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero, consistent with the code's benign nature. The slight elevation of securityRisk in one report (0.1) is acceptable given the context, but overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
