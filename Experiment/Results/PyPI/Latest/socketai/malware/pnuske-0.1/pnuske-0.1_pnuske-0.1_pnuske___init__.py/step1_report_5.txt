  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely to execute or utilize it elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; no external data inputs or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data leaks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identifiable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Code is extremely minimal, only an import statement. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscated code, secrets, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module named 'main'. There are no inputs, outputs, or behaviors observable beyond the import statement. Without additional context or the content of 'main', there is no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks. The snippet is standard Python code with no anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears benign and typical for Python modules.",
