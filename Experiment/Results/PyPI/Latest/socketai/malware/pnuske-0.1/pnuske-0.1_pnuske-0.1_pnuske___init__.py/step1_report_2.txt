{
  "purpose": "Importing the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely to execute or invoke application logic.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is not a data source; it simply loads code from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is processed or transmitted in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow is visible beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement importing 'run' from a local module. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or network communication. Since it's a minimal snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The absence of additional context limits the assessment, but based solely on this code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing a simple import with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
