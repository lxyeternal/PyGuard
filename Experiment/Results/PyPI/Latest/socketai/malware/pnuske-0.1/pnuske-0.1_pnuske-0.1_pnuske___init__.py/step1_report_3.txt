  "purpose": "Import the 'run' function from the local 'main' module, likely for execution or further use within the package.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'run' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external output, or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no anomalies detected in this fragment. Lack of context prevents deeper analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module, which is standard in Python packages. It does not execute any code, read input, or handle data. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are evident. Given the brevity, it provides no malicious signals, but also limits thorough assessment of the entire package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to import a function. No malicious behavior or security risks are identifiable in this minimal fragment.",
