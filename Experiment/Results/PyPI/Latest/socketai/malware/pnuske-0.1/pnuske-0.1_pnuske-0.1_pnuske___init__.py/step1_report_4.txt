  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function named 'run' from a relative module 'main'. There is no execution, data handling, network activity, or security-sensitive operations shown. Since this is only an import statement, it cannot by itself contain malicious behavior. Without additional context or code, no malicious intent or security risks can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It is a minimal, benign snippet.",
