  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'opshub' Python library.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata such as name, version, description, author, classifiers, and Python version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data is processed or outputted in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; the script solely defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The script follows standard setup.py conventions without suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The setup.py imports setuptools for package configuration and defines the package metadata with static values. No external input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no hardcoded secrets, no code injection points, or suspicious behaviors. The code strictly adheres to typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py file appears to be a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks.",
