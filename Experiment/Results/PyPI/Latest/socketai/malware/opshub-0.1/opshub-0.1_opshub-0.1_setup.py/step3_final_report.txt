  "purpose": "A standard setup script for packaging a Python library using setuptools, defining package metadata without dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static metadata definitions within setup(), find_packages() for package discovery.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data or execute external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup.py script that imports setuptools, then calls setup() with fixed parameters. It uses find_packages() to include all sub-packages. There are no dynamic elements, external data reads, or code execution. The script is typical for Python package distribution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No vulnerabilities or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and consistent. No further action is necessary.",
