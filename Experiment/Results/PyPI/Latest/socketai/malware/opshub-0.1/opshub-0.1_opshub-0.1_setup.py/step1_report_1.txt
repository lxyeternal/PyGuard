  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'opshub' Python library, defining metadata and package contents.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present; static configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no code executing external commands or handling sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; primarily static package setup information.",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup script with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; no dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py used to package a Python library, using setuptools. It specifies package metadata and dependencies without reading external inputs or executing suspicious code. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. It is a straightforward configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign package setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
