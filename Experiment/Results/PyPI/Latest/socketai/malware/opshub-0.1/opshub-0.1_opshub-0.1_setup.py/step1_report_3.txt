  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; no data is transmitted or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the script only configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is standard setup.py configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata. It specifies package details like name, version, author, and classifiers. There are no dynamic code executions, external data sources, or suspicious constructs. The script appears straightforward and intended solely for package installation setup.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py file contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard package configuration script with no anomalies or signs of malware.",
