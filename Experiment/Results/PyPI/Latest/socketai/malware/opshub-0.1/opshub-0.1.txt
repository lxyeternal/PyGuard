      "conclusion": "The main security concern is the embedded, obfuscated code in the status() method that is decoded and executed dynamically. This pattern strongly indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution or backdoor access. The high obfuscation and malware scores are justified, and the code should be treated as malicious or compromised. Further review and removal of the obfuscated payload are recommended."
