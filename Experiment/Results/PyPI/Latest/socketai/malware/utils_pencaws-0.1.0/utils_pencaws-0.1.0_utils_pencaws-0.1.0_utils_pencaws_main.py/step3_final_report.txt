{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the supply chain security posture of the open source dependency based on provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "No actual code snippets provided; analysis based solely on report descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data sources or sinks identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; absence of code prevents source-to-sink flow analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; reports consistently indicate no suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code or suspicious activity, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0. and low security risk scores (~0.2). Confidence levels vary appropriately based on the limited information, with cautious but justified assessments. No logical inconsistencies or contradictions are present. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, reflecting a benign evaluation in the absence of concrete evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities based on current reports. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the conservative risk score reflects limited context but no detected threats.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
