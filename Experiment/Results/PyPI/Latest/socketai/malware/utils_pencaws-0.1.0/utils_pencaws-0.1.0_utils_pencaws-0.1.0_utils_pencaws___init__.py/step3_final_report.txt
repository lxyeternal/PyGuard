  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data handling functions, potentially eval() or exec() calls.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file operations, eval()/exec() execution points.",
  "flows": "Input data -> eval()/exec() or other functions -> potential code execution or data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() or exec() without input validation, absence of code in some reports, empty scripts.",
  "analysis": "Most reports lack actual code, relying on descriptions; no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of eval() is flagged as a security concern but not confirmed malicious. Confidence levels vary based on available information. Malware scores are appropriately low; security risks are conservative but could be slightly elevated where eval() is involved. Obfuscation is not detected. The assessments are consistent with the evidence provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no confirmed malicious payloads or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of eval(), which warrants cautious handling but does not constitute malicious behavior without further context. Overall, the security posture is low risk, with minor adjustments recommended for eval() usage in risk scoring.",
