{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility script for data processing, possibly involving reading input data, processing it, and outputting results.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from environment variables, user inputs, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Data may be output to the console, files, or network connections; potential sinks include system calls or external servers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, potentially passing through insecure or unvalidated steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses some dynamic features like eval() or exec(), which could be risky, but only if combined with untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and files, processes data with standard Python functions. There is no evidence of malicious network activity or data exfiltration. The use of eval() is a concern if untrusted input is involved, but this is not confirmed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. The structure is straightforward and appears to serve a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical data processing script with no obvious malicious behavior or security risks. The primary concern is the use of eval() with untrusted input, which could pose a security risk if exploited. Overall, it does not demonstrate malware characteristics.",
