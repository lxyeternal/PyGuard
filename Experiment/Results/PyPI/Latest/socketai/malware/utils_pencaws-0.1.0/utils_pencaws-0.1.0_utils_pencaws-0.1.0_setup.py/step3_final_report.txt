  "purpose": "Embedded reverse shell backdoor connecting to a hardcoded IP and port, executing received commands.",
  "sources": "Socket connection to hardcoded IP (172.26.78.225) and port (4444), receiving commands via s.recv()",
  "sinks": "subprocess.Popen() executing commands with shell=True, sending output back over socket",
  "flows": "Data received from socket flows into subprocess.Popen() for execution, output sent back over socket",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded IP and port, persistent connection, command execution without validation, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a persistent reverse shell connection to a fixed IP, waits for commands, executes them via subprocess with shell=True, and returns output. The setup code is benign; malicious behavior is embedded after setup. No obfuscation or encryption is used. The code's behavior is characteristic of a malicious backdoor. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.9, security risk ~0.9-1, obfuscated 0) are consistent with this behavior. The code allows remote command execution, posing a high security threat. The connection to a fixed IP and unvalidated command execution confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a high-severity malicious backdoor (reverse shell) with full remote control capabilities. The setup code is benign. The embedded code's behavior warrants maximum malware and security risk scores. The code is straightforward, not obfuscated, but highly dangerous.",
