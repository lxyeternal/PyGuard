{
  "purpose": "The code installs a Python package called 'pojang_resorter' and runs a post-installation script that takes a screenshot and sends it to a Discord webhook.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the system to take a screenshot via PIL.ImageGrab.grab() and reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "The code sends an HTTP POST request to a Discord webhook URL with the screenshot file and message payload. It also invokes subprocess.check_call to run pip install commands.",
  "flows": "The code captures a screenshot and sends it via HTTP POST to the webhook (source: ImageGrab.grab(); sink: requests.post). It then installs required packages using subprocess (source: subprocess.check_call; sink: pip install).",
  "anomalies": "The post_install function is designed to run automatically upon package installation, which is unusual and potentially malicious. The script captures and uploads a screenshot to an external server without user consent. The code attempts to silently install additional packages without explicit user approval. The URL used for the webhook appears to be hardcoded and points to an external domain, which could be malicious or for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing necessary modules and defines a webhook URL. The post_install() function captures a screenshot using PIL.ImageGrab.grab() and uploads it to the specified Discord webhook, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The function then installs required packages silently. The setup() function registers a console script that points to the post_install function, indicating that it runs automatically after installation. This behavior is suspicious as it performs actions without explicit user consent, including capturing a screenshot and transmitting it externally. The use of subprocess to install packages without user approval further increases risk. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious monitoring or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by automatically capturing and transmitting a screenshot to an external server upon installation, and silently installing additional packages. This constitutes a security risk and is likely intended for tracking or data exfiltration without user consent.",
