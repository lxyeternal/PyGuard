{
  "purpose": "The code captures a screenshot during installation, exfiltrates it to a hardcoded Discord webhook, and installs dependencies silently, indicating malicious intent to spy on users without consent.",
  "sources": "ImageGrab.grab() for screenshot, requests.post() to send data, subprocess.check_call() to install packages",
  "sinks": "Network POST request to external webhook URL, silent package installation via pip",
  "flows": "Screenshot captured by ImageGrab.grab() → sent via requests.post() to webhook URL; subprocess installs packages during setup",
  "anomalies": "Capturing and transmitting user screenshots without consent during setup, hardcoded webhook URL, silent dependency installation, function linked in entry_points but not explicitly invoked in setup",
  "analysis": "The code defines a post_install() function that captures a screenshot and exfiltrates it via a network request, then installs packages silently. Although not explicitly invoked during setup, the presence of an entry point suggests it could be run as a CLI command, or potentially exploited. The network activity and data exfiltration are clear indicators of malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. The behavior violates user privacy and could be used maliciously. The high malware score (0.9) and security risk score (0.9) are justified by the covert collection and transmission of user data without consent.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains malicious behavior through covert screenshot exfiltration and silent dependency installation, posing a serious privacy and security threat. The high malware and risk scores are appropriate given the evidence.",
