  "purpose": "Platform detection and conditional import of OS-specific monitoring modules for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS; static imports of monitoring modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "OS detection source leads to conditional import of WindowsMonitoring; static imports of other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward platform detection and static imports; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple OS check using platform.system(), conditionally imports WindowsMonitoring if OS is Windows, and always imports MacMonitoring, initialize_system_monitoring, and InputMonitor. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no network activity. The structure is standard for cross-platform modules. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1). The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify these scores. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard platform-dependent import pattern with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
