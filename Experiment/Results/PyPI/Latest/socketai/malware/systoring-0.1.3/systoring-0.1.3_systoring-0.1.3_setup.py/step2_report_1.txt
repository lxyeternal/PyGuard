  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a standard setup script for a Python package named 'systoring'.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns are identified.\n- Dependencies are typical for a system monitoring library, with platform-specific optional dependencies.\n- No data sinks, network activity, or untrusted input handling are present.\n- The code is straightforward, reading a README.md file and passing data to setuptools.setup().\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.\n- The dependencies listed (pynput, pywin32, pyobjc-framework-Cocoa) are common for system interaction and monitoring.\n- The purpose appears educational and benign, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n| Aspect             | Reported Value | Justification / Comments                                    | Suggested Adjustment |\n|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Obfuscated         | 0              | No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward.            | Keep as is.          |\n| Malware            | 0              | No malicious behavior or code present.                        | Keep as is.          |\n| Security Risk      | 0              | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.           | Keep as is.          |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The malware score is correctly 0.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain unchanged.",
