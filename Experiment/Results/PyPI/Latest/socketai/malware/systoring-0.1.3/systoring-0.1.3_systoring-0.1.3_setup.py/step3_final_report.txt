  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'systoring' Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependency declarations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> passing data to setuptools.setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup code with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for a Python package, performing standard tasks such as reading a README file and specifying dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. Dependencies are common for system monitoring and platform-specific modules. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, with high confidence. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
