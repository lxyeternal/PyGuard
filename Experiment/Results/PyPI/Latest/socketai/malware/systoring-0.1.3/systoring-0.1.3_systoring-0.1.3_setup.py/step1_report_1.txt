  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'systoring' package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; setup parameters do not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Read file content -> pass data to setup() parameters; install_requires and extras_require specify dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading a README file, defining package info, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Dependencies are specified for different OSes, but no suspicious or malicious packages are listed. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
