  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement and an `__all__` declaration. There are no signs of data processing, input handling, or output that could introduce security risks. The code is benign and straightforward.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. This is accurate given the code snippet. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n   These scores seem reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign a security risk of 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity, this is justified. No higher risk scores are warranted.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis that the code is benign.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code only performs an import and export declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple module that imports a class and exposes it via `__all__`. It contains no logic, no data handling, no external inputs, and no suspicious patterns. There is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. No adjustments are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code snippet.",
