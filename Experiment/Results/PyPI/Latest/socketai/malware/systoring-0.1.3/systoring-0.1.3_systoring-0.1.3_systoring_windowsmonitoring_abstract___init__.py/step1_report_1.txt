  "purpose": "The code defines a module that exports the AbstractSender class from the sender module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing AbstractSender from a relative module; no input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations; code only performs import and export definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class and defining an export list. It contains no logic, no data input or output, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The simplicity suggests it is a straightforward module definition with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply exposes a class from another module.",
