  "purpose": "This code imports the AbstractSender class from a local sender module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a module export setup.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .sender module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs",
  "flows": "Import from sender module to module namespace; no data flow beyond import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a class and declares it in __all__. There are no data flows, input/output, or logic. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple reviews. No obfuscation or security issues are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No further action or concern is warranted.",
