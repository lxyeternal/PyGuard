  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal module that imports and exposes a class, with no input/output, data processing, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - malware: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely import/export with no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted. The current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's benign nature. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is a standard module setup with no security concerns.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' thoroughness, I agree with the current scores. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, with no security concerns.",
