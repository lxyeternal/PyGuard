  "purpose": "Defines and exports an abstract sender class for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.sender import AbstractSender). No input reading beyond module import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class called AbstractSender from a local module and exposes it via __all__, indicating it's intended for public use. No runtime data processing, no user input handling, and no side effects are present. The code appears standard and simple, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and appears benign. It functions as a module declaration for exporting AbstractSender, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
