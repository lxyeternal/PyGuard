{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes and enums from local modules and defines the public API for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data is processed or outputted directly",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely import and export statements",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; simple module imports and exports",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and an __all__ declaration. It does not include any logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or code injection. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, aimed at defining the package interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign package initialization script that sets up module exports. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
