  "purpose": "Module export setup for a Python package, exposing classes and enums for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific classes and enums from internal modules and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no logic, data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. All reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module setup with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should be maintained.",
