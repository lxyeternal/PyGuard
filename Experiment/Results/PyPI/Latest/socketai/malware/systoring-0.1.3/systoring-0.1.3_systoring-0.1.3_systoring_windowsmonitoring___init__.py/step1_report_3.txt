  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module import and export statement, likely part of a larger package related to Windows monitoring and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this code; it only imports and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; only import/export statements are present",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and enumerations from internal modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or suspicious behaviors. The snippet functions solely as a module interface declaration, which is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely re-exports symbols for external modules.",
