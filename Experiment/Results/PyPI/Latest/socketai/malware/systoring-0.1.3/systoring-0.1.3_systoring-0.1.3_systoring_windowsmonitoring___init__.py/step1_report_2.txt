  "purpose": "This code is used to import specific classes and constants from local modules for use in a larger Python project, likely related to monitoring or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication present in this code",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports symbols without processing untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple imports and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It does not process input, communicate externally, or execute any dynamic code. The import statements are relative and limited to local modules, which are typical in package structures. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module import and export declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard for organizing code in a package.",
