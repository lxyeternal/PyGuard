  "purpose": "This code defines an interface for importing specific modules and classes related to Windows monitoring, enums, and utilities, and exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .windowsmonitoring, .enums, .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leakage or malicious data flow are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily module and class imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and constants from local files and specifies them for export. It does not contain any runtime data processing, external data reading, or network operations. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file or module entry point, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard module declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It merely organizes imports and exports for a package.",
