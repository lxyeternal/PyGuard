{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports specific classes from sibling modules and exposes them via the __all__ list for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from sibling modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network communication, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Import statements directly load classes; no data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with static imports and an __all__ declaration",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module initializer importing classes and defining an export list. No dynamic code execution, external communication, or data processing occurs. The code structure is typical for a package's __init__.py. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the static and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module initializer with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the current scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
