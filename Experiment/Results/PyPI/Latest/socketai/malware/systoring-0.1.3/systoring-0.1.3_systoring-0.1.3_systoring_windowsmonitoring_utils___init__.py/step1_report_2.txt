{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import specific classes from relative modules and define an export list for the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; no untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; imports are static and do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; simple import statements and export list",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from local modules and defines __all__ for exports. There is no data processing, user input, or network interaction. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a package's __init__.py or module entry point. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard package initialization code with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as an interface for module exports without processing sensitive data or external interactions.",
