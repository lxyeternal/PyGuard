{
  "purpose": "The code is primarily used to import specific classes or functions from local modules and define an export list for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.ast, .mssg, .lfr, .prtt, .grb)",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or external data outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; import statements are static and do not process untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected; simple module import/export setup",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes/functions from local modules and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no runtime data processing, no external network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python modules. No signs of malicious intent or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as a module to organize and expose internal classes or functions. It does not contain malware or security risks.",
