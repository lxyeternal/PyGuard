  "purpose": "Initialize and start system monitoring for Mac or Windows platforms along with input monitoring.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for platform detection, threading.Thread for starting monitoring threads, InputMonitor().start_monitoring for input data collection.",
  "sinks": "Start monitoring functions (MacMonitor().run, WindowsMonitor().run, InputMonitor().start_monitoring) that could potentially collect and process sensitive data.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional platform check -> threading.Thread -> start() -> monitoring functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage appears straightforward for platform detection and thread management.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and starts input monitoring along with platform-specific system monitoring in separate threads. It imports monitoring classes from external modules, presumably for system surveillance. No data is transmitted externally, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present. The threading usage is standard, and the functions called seem intended for system monitoring purposes. No malicious intent or malicious code behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code initializes system monitoring and input tracking in a platform-aware manner. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a legitimate part of a monitoring tool.",
