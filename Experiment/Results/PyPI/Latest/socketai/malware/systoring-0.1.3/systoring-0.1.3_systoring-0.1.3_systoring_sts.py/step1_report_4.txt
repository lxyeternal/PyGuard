  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring threads for Mac and Windows platforms.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for platform detection, InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input monitoring, and platform-specific monitor classes for system monitoring.",
  "sinks": "Threads executing monitor functions, which could potentially capture system or input data.",
  "flows": "platform.system() → input_monitor thread → system_monitor thread",
  "anomalies": "Use of threading to run monitoring functions without explicit data validation or security checks; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious imports; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and starts input and system monitoring threads accordingly. No malicious or suspicious code such as network transmission, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. Monitoring functions are invoked as threads, which is typical for background monitoring. The imported modules seem to be related to system monitoring, with no indication of malicious intent. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script sets up system monitoring on Mac and Windows platforms in a standard manner. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment. It appears to be legitimate monitoring code.",
