  "purpose": "Detects the operating system and starts input and system monitoring in background threads based on platform detection.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for OS detection, InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input data, platform-specific monitoring classes (MacMonitoring, WindowsMonitoring).",
  "sinks": "Monitoring functions potentially collect system and input data; no data transmission or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "OS detection -> thread creation for input monitoring -> thread creation for platform-specific monitoring.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected. No hardcoded credentials or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward platform detection and initiates monitoring threads accordingly. It uses standard modules and patterns, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The monitoring classes are imported from external modules presumed legitimate. No data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code is clear, and threading is used appropriately. Privacy concerns are inherent but do not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified based on the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate platform-specific monitoring setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects privacy considerations rather than security threats. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate.",
