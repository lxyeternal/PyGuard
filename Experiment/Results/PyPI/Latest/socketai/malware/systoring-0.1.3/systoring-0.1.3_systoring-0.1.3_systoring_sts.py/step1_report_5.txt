  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring threads for Mac and Windows platforms.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for platform detection, threading.Thread for starting monitoring threads, imports of monitoring classes (MacMonitoring, InputMonitor, WindowsMonitoring).",
  "sinks": "None identified—no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "platform.system() determines platform; input_monitor thread runs InputMonitor().start_monitoring; system_monitor threads run MacMonitor().run or WindowsMonitor().run depending on platform.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; standard use of threading for monitoring tasks; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically determines the OS platform and starts monitoring threads accordingly, using imported modules for platform-specific monitoring. It employs threading to run monitoring functions concurrently. There are no indications of malicious actions, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward system monitoring setup with no hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a platform-specific system monitoring initializer. No signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code appears legitimate and safe for use.",
