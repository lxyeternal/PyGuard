  "purpose": "Initialize platform-specific system monitoring and input monitoring threads based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call to determine OS, import statements for monitoring classes, threading.Thread targets for monitoring functions.",
  "sinks": "threading.Thread targets (start_monitoring, run) executing potentially platform-specific monitoring code.",
  "flows": "platform.system() output -> conditionals -> thread target functions (start_monitoring, run) -> thread start.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code behaviors. Imports and threading are standard for monitoring tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports monitoring classes specific to macOS and Windows and starts monitoring in separate threads based on detected OS. It uses platform detection and threading, which are typical for monitoring applications. No suspicious or malicious activity detected, such as network communications, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The code appears to set up monitoring services safely and legitimately. No anomalies indicating sabotage or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code initializes platform-specific monitoring threads in a straightforward manner. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code snippet. The setup appears typical for system monitoring tools, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
