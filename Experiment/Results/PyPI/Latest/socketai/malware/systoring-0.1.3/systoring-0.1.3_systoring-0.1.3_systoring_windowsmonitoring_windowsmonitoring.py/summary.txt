  "conclusion": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior characteristic of spyware or data-stealing malware, with high confidence. It uses hardcoded credentials, disables SSL verification, and exfiltrates sensitive data covertly. The overall security risk is very high, and the malware score is justified at 0.9."
