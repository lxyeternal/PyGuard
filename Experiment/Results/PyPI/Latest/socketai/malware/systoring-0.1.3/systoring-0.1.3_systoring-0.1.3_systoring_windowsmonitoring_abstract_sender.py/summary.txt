  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious abstract class with a security-sensitive feature (SSL verification bypass). No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary risk is if the SSL bypass is invoked during sensitive operations, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2-0.3."
