      "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious intent to establish a reverse shell during package installation, representing a severe security backdoor. Despite the typo preventing immediate execution, the intent and structure are evident, warranting high malware and risk scores. The package should be considered malicious and unsafe for use."

The primary issue is a syntax error, which should be corrected for proper execution. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The overall security posture is safe, with only a simple bug present."
