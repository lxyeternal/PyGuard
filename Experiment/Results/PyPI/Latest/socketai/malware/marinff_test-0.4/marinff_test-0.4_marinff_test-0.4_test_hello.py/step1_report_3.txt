  "purpose": "A simple function to print 'hello world' when executed.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output to untrusted destinations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in the if statement: '=' should be '=='. No malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function hello() that prints a greeting. The main block is intended to call this function when the script runs directly, but contains a syntax error in the conditional statement (should be '__name__ == \"__main__\"'). No external data handling, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a simple demonstration or test script with an error.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The only issue is a syntax error preventing correct execution.",
