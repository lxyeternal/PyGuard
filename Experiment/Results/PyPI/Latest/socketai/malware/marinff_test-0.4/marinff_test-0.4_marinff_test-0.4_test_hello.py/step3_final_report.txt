  "purpose": "Simple demonstration of a 'Hello World' function with a main guard.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; the code is self-contained.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or external communication.",
  "flows": "Function call within main guard; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Syntax error in the main guard line (`if __name__ = \"__main__\":`) using `=` instead of `==`.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function `hello()` that prints a message. The main guard is intended to execute `hello()` when the script runs directly. However, the line `if __name__ = \"__main__\":` contains a syntax error due to the use of `=` instead of `==`, which would prevent execution. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling is present. The error is a simple typo, not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1) due to the syntax error preventing execution but not posing a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with a minor syntax mistake that causes a runtime error. There is no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary issue is a syntax error, which should be corrected for proper execution. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at 0. The overall security posture is safe, with only a simple bug present.",
