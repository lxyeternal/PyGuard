  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources; the code only outputs static text",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the main guard: '=' instead of '==' in 'if __name__ = \"__main__\"'",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello' that prints a static message. The main guard intends to execute the function if the script is run directly. However, there is a syntax error in the main guard ('=' instead of '=='), which would prevent execution and cause a runtime error. The code does not perform any input reading, data transmission, or contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. No anomalies related to obfuscation or malicious intent are present beyond the typo.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script with a minor syntax error that prevents execution. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
