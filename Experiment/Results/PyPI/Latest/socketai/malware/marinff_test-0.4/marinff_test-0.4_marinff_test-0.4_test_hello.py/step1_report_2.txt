  "purpose": "Simple script to print 'hello world' when executed",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static code with no data reads",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or commands that process untrusted input",
  "flows": "No data flows from input to output or sinks",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the main guard statement: '=' used instead of '=='",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function 'hello' that prints a message. The main guard is intended to execute 'hello()' if the script is run directly. However, there is a syntax error in the conditional statement: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":' uses a single equals sign, which is invalid in Python; it should be '=='. This error prevents the script from executing as intended. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is extremely simple and contains no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic 'Hello World' example with a syntax mistake in the main guard. It does not contain malicious code or security issues. The primary concern is the syntax error, not malicious intent.",
