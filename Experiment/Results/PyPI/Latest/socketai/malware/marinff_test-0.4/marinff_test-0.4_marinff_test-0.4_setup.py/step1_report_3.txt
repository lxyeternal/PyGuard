{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process to automatically establish a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port upon installation.",
  "sources": "LHOST and LPORT variables, encoded reverse_shell string, os.system command execution",
  "sinks": "os.system command which executes decoded base64 payload that initiates reverse shell",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, then decodes and executes it via os.system during package installation",
  "anomalies": "Embedding reverse shell command within setup script, encoding command in base64 to hide malicious intent, running system commands during package install",
  "analysis": "The script extends the setuptools installation process by defining a CustomInstall class that overrides the run method. During installation, it creates a reverse shell command targeting a specific IP and port, encodes this command in base64, and then executes it after decoding. This behavior is malicious as it establishes an unauthorized remote connection to the attacker-controlled server, allowing remote code execution. The use of base64 encoding suggests an attempt to obfuscate the malicious intent. The command is crafted to spawn a bash shell and redirect input/output to the socket, indicating control over the infected system. This pattern is typical of malicious package behavior designed to compromise user systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is malicious, embedding a reverse shell payload that automatically executes during package installation. It is designed to establish unauthorized remote access, which is a severe security threat. This package should be considered unsafe and malicious.",
