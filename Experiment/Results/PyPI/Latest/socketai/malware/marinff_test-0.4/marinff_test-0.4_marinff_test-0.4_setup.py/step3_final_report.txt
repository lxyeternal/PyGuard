{
  "purpose": "The code aims to execute a reverse shell during the installation process by constructing a malicious command, encoding it in base64, decoding, and executing it, thereby establishing remote access back to an attacker-controlled server.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded IP ('192.168.239.158') and port (1234), constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes the decoded base64 string, which runs the reverse shell command, establishing a network connection to the attacker's server and spawning a bash shell.",
  "flows": "The source (hardcoded IP and port) feeds into the construction of the reverse shell command, which is then base64-encoded (obfuscation), decoded during execution, and run via os.system, leading to the sink (reverse shell connection and shell spawn).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a typo ('secket' instead of 'socket') in the socket creation line, which would cause runtime errors; use of base64 encoding to obfuscate malicious intent; execution during package setup, which is highly suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code overrides the install command to execute a reverse shell payload embedded within the setup script. It constructs a command with hardcoded IP and port, encodes it in base64 for obfuscation, then decodes and executes it via os.system. The typo in 'secket' would prevent execution unless corrected, indicating either an error or an attempt to evade static detection. The core behavior—establishing a remote shell—constitutes a severe security threat. The use of base64 encoding is a common obfuscation technique, and executing such code during installation is highly malicious. The high malware and security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, though the typo reduces the actual functionality unless fixed.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious intent to establish a reverse shell during package installation, representing a severe security backdoor. Despite the typo preventing immediate execution, the intent and structure are evident, warranting high malware and risk scores. The package should be considered malicious and unsafe for use.",
