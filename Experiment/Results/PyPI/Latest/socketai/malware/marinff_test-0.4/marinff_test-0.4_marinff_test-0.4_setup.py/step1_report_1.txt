{
  "purpose": "Custom setup script that installs a Python module and attempts to establish a reverse shell connection during installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines static variables LHOST and LPORT, and encodes and executes a reverse shell command during installation.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands via os.system, which runs a base64-decoded shell command that initiates a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP and port.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, leading to network connection establishment to the specified IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded IP address and port for reverse shell, encoding and decoding commands, and execution during package installation. The reverse shell code is embedded directly in the setup process, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup tools and overrides the install command to execute malicious behavior during installation. It defines a reverse shell command in Python that connects back to a specific IP and port. The command is base64-encoded, then decoded and executed via os.system, which creates a remote connection, potentially allowing unauthorized access. The reverse shell code includes errors: 'socket(secket.AF_INET...' should be 'socket.socket(socket.AF_INET...'. Despite the typo, the intent is clear: establish a reverse shell. The code does not sanitize or verify inputs, and hardcodes sensitive connection details, indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script contains malicious behavior aimed at establishing a reverse shell upon installation, indicating high malicious potential. The presence of hardcoded IP, encoded commands, and execution during setup strongly suggests malicious intent.",
