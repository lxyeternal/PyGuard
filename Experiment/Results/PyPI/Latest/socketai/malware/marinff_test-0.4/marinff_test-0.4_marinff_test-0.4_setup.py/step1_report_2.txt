{
  "purpose": "This setup script installs a Python module and includes a custom installation step that executes a reverse shell connection to a specified IP and port.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input sources; it uses hardcoded IP address and port within the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The os.system call executes a base64-decoded script that opens a reverse shell, connecting back to the specified IP and port.",
  "flows": "The script encodes a reverse shell command in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, establishing a network connection back to the attacker-controlled host.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded IP and port, and automatically executes a reverse shell upon installation, which is malicious behavior. The reverse shell command is intentionally obfuscated via base64 encoding.",
  "analysis": "The setup script imports necessary modules and defines a CustomInstall class overriding the run method. In run, it constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP and port, encodes it in base64, and executes it via os.system after decoding. This causes the machine to connect back to a remote attacker, effectively creating a backdoor during installation. The reverse shell command is crafted in a way that it opens a socket connection and spawns a bash shell, which is highly suspicious and malicious. The use of base64 encoding for the command suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, the code's primary function during setup is malicious, creating a persistent backdoor.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains malicious behavior by executing a reverse shell during installation, which constitutes a backdoor. It uses obfuscation and hardcoded network parameters to facilitate unauthorized remote access. This is a serious security risk and should not be used.",
