{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the installation process to include a reverse shell payload that connects back to a specified IP and port, likely for remote control or malicious access.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command constructed with hardcoded IP and port, and the encoded command executed via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system execution of decoded base64 command, which runs a reverse shell payload, establishing an external connection.",
  "flows": "The script constructs a reverse shell command with hardcoded IP/port, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it via os.system, leading to remote access.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a reverse shell payload embedded directly into the setup script, hardcoded network parameters, and execution of decoded base64 payload at install time.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines the install command to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. It hardcodes IP and port for remote connection, encodes the payload in base64, and executes it through os.system. The payload attempts to establish a persistent connection back to a remote attacker-controlled host, effectively providing remote access. Such behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent, as it installs a backdoor during setup. The usage of base64 encoding is a common obfuscation technique to hide malicious commands. There are no signs of obfuscation beyond encoding, and the code is straightforward in its malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a clear malicious backdoor that initiates a reverse shell connection during installation. It hardcodes external network parameters, encodes the payload for obfuscation, and executes it automatically, indicating high malicious intent.",
