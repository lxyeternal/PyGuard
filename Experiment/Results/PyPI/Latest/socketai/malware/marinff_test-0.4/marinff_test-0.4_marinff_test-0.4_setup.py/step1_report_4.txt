{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package and overrides the installation process to execute a reverse shell command upon installation.",
  "sources": "The reverse shell command is constructed within the run() method of the CustomInstall class.",
  "sinks": "The encoded reverse shell command is executed via os.system after decoding from base64, leading to remote code execution.",
  "flows": "During installation, the code constructs a reverse shell command, encodes it in base64, decodes it, and executes it with os.system, establishing a remote connection to a specified IP and port.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded IP address and port for reverse shell, executes system commands during setup, and encodes the malicious command in base64 to obfuscate intent. The reverse shell code references a misspelled socket object ('secket' instead of 'socket'), which could cause runtime errors but suggests intent to perform remote code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and overrides the install command to run additional code post-installation. It constructs a reverse shell payload that connects to a hardcoded IP (192.168.239.158) on port 1234, encoded in base64, and executes it using os.system. The payload aims to spawn a bash shell over the network, effectively creating a backdoor. The use of base64 encoding is likely an attempt at obfuscation. The misspelling 'secket' instead of 'socket' indicates either an error or an attempt to evade simple static analysis, but the intent remains malicious. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it provides remote access without user consent during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior—install-time remote reverse shell with hardcoded network details and obfuscated execution—which indicates an intentional backdoor. The attempt to hide the payload with base64 encoding further supports malicious intent. Despite a typo in the socket object name, the overall behavior is dangerous and should not be used.",
