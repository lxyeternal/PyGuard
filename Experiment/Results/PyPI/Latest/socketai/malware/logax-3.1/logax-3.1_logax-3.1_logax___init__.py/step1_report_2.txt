  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'info' via an import statement.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this line, as it's a straightforward import.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'info' module into the current namespace, but no untrusted data handling occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement alone does not indicate malicious intent; however, without inspecting 'info', potential concerns remain if 'info' contains malicious code.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement that imports all definitions from the 'info' module located in the same package. It does not execute any code directly nor handle untrusted data. The security assessment depends heavily on the contents of 'info', which are not provided. If 'info' contains malicious code, it could be malicious, but based solely on this line, there is no indication of malicious behavior. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident. The code's minimal nature limits the ability to identify malicious activity without examining 'info'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic import statement with no inherent malicious behavior. The security risk depends on the contents of 'info', which are not visible here. No suspicious activity or malware indications are evident from this snippet alone.",
