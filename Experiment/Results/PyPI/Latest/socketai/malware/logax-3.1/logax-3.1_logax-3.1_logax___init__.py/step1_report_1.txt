  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'info'.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'info'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows are visible from this statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported contents, potentially hiding malicious code, but by itself it's not malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs an import from a relative module named 'info'. There are no direct signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data leakage, or code injection. The 'import *' syntax is generally discouraged due to readability and maintainability concerns, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Without additional context or code, it's impossible to identify malicious activity or obfuscation. No anomalous or suspicious code patterns are evident from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement importing all symbols from a local module. It does not show any signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this line. Further code review would be necessary to determine if the 'info' module contains malicious content.",
