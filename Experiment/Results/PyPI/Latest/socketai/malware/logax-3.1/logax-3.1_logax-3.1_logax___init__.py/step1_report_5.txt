{
  "purpose": "The code imports all definitions from the 'info' module, likely to use its variables, functions, or classes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.info).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the import statement could potentially load untrusted code if the 'info' module is malicious or tampered with.",
  "flows": "Import from .info → usage of imported symbols (not shown here).",
  "anomalies": "The use of a wildcard import ('*') can obscure which symbols are brought into scope, potentially hiding malicious functions or variables. However, the code itself is minimal and standard; no suspicious behaviors like network access or data manipulation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a single import statement from a local module, which is a common Python pattern. The wildcard import can be considered risky in larger contexts, but on its own, it is not inherently malicious. Without additional code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The potential concern is if the 'info' module is malicious or compromised, but that is outside the scope of this single statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import statement with no apparent malicious intent. The main concern is the use of wildcard import which can hide the origin and content of imported symbols, but does not itself indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the risk appears low based solely on this fragment.",
