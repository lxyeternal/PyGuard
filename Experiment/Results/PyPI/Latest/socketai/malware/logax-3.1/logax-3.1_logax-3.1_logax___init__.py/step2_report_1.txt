  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is a relative import that imports all symbols from the local module `info`.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation in this single line.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and maintainability issues, but it is not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Import all from `info`; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.6\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no signs of malicious activity. The risk score is low, justified by the lack of evidence. The confidence level is moderate, reflecting uncertainty about the contents of `info`.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same import; no direct signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.4\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The low security risk score aligns with the minimal code shown. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same import; potential for hiding malicious code if `info` is malicious.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.6\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk due to the wildcard import, which can obscure imported symbols. Still, no direct evidence of malicious activity. The reasoning is appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Same import; no malicious behavior, but namespace pollution concern.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence is justified given the commonality of such imports and the lack of suspicious activity. The security risk is minimal.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same import; potential concern if `info` is malicious.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.6\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The main concern is the potential for malicious content in `info`, but the code itself does not show malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores:\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the limited code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, consistent with the straightforward import statement.\n- **Risk scores:** They are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the minimal code and the fact that malicious activity cannot be inferred from this line alone.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign risk scores above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The highest is 0.2, justified by the potential for the imported module to contain malicious code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis. The primary concern is the content of `info`, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The import statement itself is not malicious.\n- The main security concern hinges on the contents of the `info` module, which is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- Use of `import *` is discouraged but not malicious; it can be flagged for maintainability reasons but not security.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to namespace pollution and potential malicious content in `info`)\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and best practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard import statement with no inherent malicious activity. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the contents of the `info` module, which cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
