  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Code Under Review:**\n```python\nfrom .info import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. Report 1\n- **Summary:** Import all from `.info`. No signs of malicious behavior; just a standard import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The import alone isn't malicious; the concern about obscurity is valid but not indicative of malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same import; depends on the content of `info`. No direct malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.4.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that the import itself isn't malicious but highlights dependency on `info` content.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Report 3\n- **Summary:** Wildcard import; potential namespace pollution but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The risk score reflects the concern about namespace pollution, not malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Report 4\n- **Summary:** Standard import; no signs of malicious activity; mainly a concern about best practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The high confidence is justified given the simplicity of the code. The risk score is low, consistent with the reasoning.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Report 5\n- **Summary:** Similar import; potential concern if `info` is malicious, but no signs here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6.\n- **Assessment:** Reasoning aligns with the previous reports. The concern about the import's content is valid but not reflected in the code itself.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The import alone does not imply malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, generally low, reflecting the potential issues with wildcard import and obscurity but not malicious intent.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high where the reasoning is strong.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a straightforward relative import with a wildcard, which is a known bad practice but not inherently malicious.\n- The reports correctly avoid assigning malware scores above zero.\n- The risk scores are conservative and aligned with the content.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to wildcard import, which can obscure code and pose maintainability issues but not necessarily security risks)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and reasonable. No significant flaws or overestimations are present. The overall security posture based on this line is low risk, with the main concern being coding best practices rather than security threats.",
