  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .info import *' can be considered bad practice as it imports all names without explicit control, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, importing everything from a local module named 'info'. This pattern can obscure what is imported and may hide malicious content if the 'info' module contains malicious code. However, based solely on this line, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. It is a common pattern in Python packages to facilitate modular code organization. There are no suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions evident in this single line. Without inspecting the 'info' module itself, the security implications are limited to the import practice, which is not malicious but can be risky if the imported module is malicious or compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement, with no direct malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for the imported module to contain malicious code, which cannot be determined from this line alone. Overall, this is a standard pattern, not inherently malicious, but warrants further inspection of the 'info' module for security.",
