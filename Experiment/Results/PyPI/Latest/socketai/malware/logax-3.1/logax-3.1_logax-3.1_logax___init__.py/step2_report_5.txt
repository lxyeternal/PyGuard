  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports are about the same line: `from .info import *`.\n   - This line performs a relative import of all symbols from a local module named `info`.\n   - The code itself does not execute any logic beyond importing.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**\n   - None of the reports indicate any signs of malicious code, such as network calls, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscation.\n   - The use of `import *` is discouraged for readability and maintainability but not inherently malicious.\n   - No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are evident.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks and Scores:**\n   - The reports assign malware scores of 0 across the board, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the minimal risk from a single import statement.\n   - Confidence levels vary but are generally moderate to high, based on the assumption that the code snippet is isolated and the content of `info` is unknown.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns & Limitations:**\n   - The main concern is that if the `info` module contains malicious code, it could be harmful when imported.\n   - However, this cannot be determined from this line alone.\n   - The wildcard import can obscure what is imported, potentially hiding malicious functions or variables, but again, this is a practice concern rather than a direct security threat.\n\n5. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the line is a simple import statement.\n   - They appropriately note that without inspecting the `info` module, no definitive security assessment can be made.\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions about maliciousness; they all lean towards low risk.\n\n6. **Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n   - The malware scores of 0 are justified given the evidence.\n   - The security risk scores are appropriately low.\n   - The confidence levels are reasonable considering the limited context.\n\n**Final Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — straightforward import statement.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal risk, mainly due to potential hidden content in `info`, which cannot be assessed here.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\nGiven the information, I concur with the provided scores. The only caveat is that if the `info` module is malicious, the risk could be higher, but this cannot be determined from the import statement alone.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard relative import.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk.\n- The main concern is the trustworthiness of the `info` module, which requires further inspection.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and reasonable. No changes needed. The security posture based on this line is low risk, with no malware indications.",
