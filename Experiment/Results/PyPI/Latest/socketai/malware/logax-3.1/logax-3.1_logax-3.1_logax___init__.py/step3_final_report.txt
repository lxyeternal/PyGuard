  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of the Python import statement 'from .info import *' in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'info' during import.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted symbols imported from 'info' could be used maliciously if the module is compromised.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads all symbols from 'info' into the namespace, potentially hiding malicious functions or variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure imported symbols, but no malicious code or obfuscation is evident in this line.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from 'info'. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation is present in this line. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the 'info' module, which cannot be assessed here. The use of 'import *' is discouraged for maintainability but not inherently malicious. Malware and obfuscation scores are set to 0, reflecting the lack of evidence of malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), indicating minimal risk but acknowledging potential issues if 'info' contains malicious code. Confidence in this assessment is moderate to high, given the limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation; no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are detected. The main security concern depends on the content of 'info', which is outside the scope of this analysis. The assigned scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating low risk and no malware presence.",
