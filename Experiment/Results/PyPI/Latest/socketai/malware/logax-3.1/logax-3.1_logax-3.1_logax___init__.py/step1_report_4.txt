  "purpose": "Import all contents from the local module named 'info'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the local module 'info'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; however, imported content may be used elsewhere which could lead to data flow issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows within this single statement; potential flows depend on usage of imported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The import is a wildcard import, which can lead to namespace pollution and obscured code behavior. No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets are present here.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a single import operation from a local module, which is common in Python projects. No malicious behavior is directly evident from this statement. The use of wildcard import can be considered bad practice but is not inherently malicious. No evidence of obfuscation, data leakage, or malware indicators in this isolated line.",
  "conclusion": "This code line is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. Its main concern is best practice related to namespace pollution, not security.",
