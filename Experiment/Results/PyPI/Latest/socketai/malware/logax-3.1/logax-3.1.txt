The assigned scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating low risk and no malware presence."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, characterized by remote code download and execution, obfuscation, and persistence mechanisms. The behavior is consistent with malware activity, and the scores assigned in the reports are justified. The overall security risk is very high, and the code should be treated as malicious."
