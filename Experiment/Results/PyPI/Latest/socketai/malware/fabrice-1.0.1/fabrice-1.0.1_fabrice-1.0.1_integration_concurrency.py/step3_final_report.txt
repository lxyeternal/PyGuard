  "purpose": "Testing SSH connection isolation, threading, and remote command execution on localhost for verifying connection independence and data processing correctness.",
  "sources": "Reads from local dictionary file (/usr/share/dict/words), constructs shell commands with internal variables, and establishes SSH connections to localhost.",
  "sinks": "Remote shell commands executed via SSH; no untrusted input or external data sources are used.",
  "flows": "Reads local data -> constructs shell commands -> executes commands over SSH connections -> processes output -> verifies data integrity through assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; command strings are built from controlled variables; test skip() indicates incomplete tests but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign testing utility designed to verify SSH connection independence, threading behavior, and remote command execution on localhost. It uses internal data and controlled command strings, with no external input influencing command construction. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The threading and connection assertions serve testing purposes. The command string formatting poses minimal risk given controlled inputs. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign, controlled testing nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, controlled testing utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its purpose. No modifications are necessary.",
