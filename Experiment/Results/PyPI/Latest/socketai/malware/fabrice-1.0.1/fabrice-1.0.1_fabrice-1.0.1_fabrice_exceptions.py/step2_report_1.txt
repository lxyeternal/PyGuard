  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the underlying code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Summary:**\n   - The code defines three custom exception classes:\n     - `NothingToDo`\n     - `GroupException` (which wraps a result object)\n     - `InvalidV1Env`\n   - The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n   - Comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **Security and Malware Assessment:**\n   - The code contains only class definitions for error handling.\n   - No data flows, external data sources, or sinks.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - The exception classes are typical in Python applications for control flow and error signaling.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct; no obfuscation)\n   - **Malware:** 0 (correct; no malicious code)\n   - **Risk:** 0 (appropriate; no security risk in defining exception classes)\n   \n   All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The comments and class definitions are standard and do not suggest any hidden malicious intent.\n   - The mention of potential future refactoring or modularization does not impact security.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is benign, standard boilerplate for error handling.\n   - No changes needed in scores.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the actual code content.\n\n**Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks present)\n\nThe reports' assessments are accurate and justified based on the code provided.",
