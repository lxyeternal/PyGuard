  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases related to task execution and environment validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines exception classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or execute sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three custom exception class definitions: 'NothingToDo', 'GroupException', and 'InvalidV1Env'. These classes are used for error handling and do not perform any data processing or external communication. The comments provide context but do not introduce malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, dangerous code, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is typical application code meant for error handling purposes.",
