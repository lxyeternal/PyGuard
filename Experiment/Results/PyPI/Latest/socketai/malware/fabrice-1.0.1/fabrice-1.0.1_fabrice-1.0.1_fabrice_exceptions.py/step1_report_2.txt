  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to task grouping and environment validation in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Code defines exception classes; no input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions with no dynamic or external data handling. The comments suggest potential future refactoring or modularization but do not introduce any suspicious logic or obfuscation. The code does not contain any malicious behavior, no data leaks, no network activity, nor does it perform any computations or operations that could be harmful.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, serving solely to define custom exception classes for use elsewhere in a larger application. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
