  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the underlying code carefully:\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code defines three custom exception classes:\n  - `NothingToDo`\n  - `GroupException` (which holds a result object)\n  - `InvalidV1Env`\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, external calls, or dynamic behavior.\n- Comments suggest potential future refactoring but do not introduce any suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of the code:** The code matches the descriptions in the reports; no discrepancies.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None observed.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The code is simple and correct for its purpose. No errors are evident.\n\n### Review of Each Report:\nAll five reports:\n- Correctly identify that the code is solely class definitions for error handling.\n- Do not identify any anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Appropriately assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n- Confidence scores are high (1), which is justified given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No malicious activity or code injection is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, with the latter being possibly conservative. Since the code is purely definitional, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0, as there is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** 0, no security risk or vulnerabilities present.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No adjustments needed to scores.\n- The code is benign, and the analysis aligns with the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions with no security implications.",
