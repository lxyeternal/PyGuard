  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for exceptions; no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are standalone.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with comments indicating potential future refactoring.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three exception classes: NothingToDo, GroupException, and InvalidV1Env. They are simple, with no dynamic behavior, external calls, or data processing. Comments suggest possible future modularization but do not introduce malicious intent. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or security risks are present. The code is standard boilerplate for error handling, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk being appropriate. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard error handling boilerplate with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
