  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled test suite for SSH and command execution functionalities. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The use of fixed credentials and environment variables is typical for testing but should be avoided in production. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2—are appropriate and reflect the controlled, non-malicious nature of the code."
