  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is only import statements, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; straightforward imports with no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, just imports, standard module initialization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct; no risks detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar import-only code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk, but given the code's nature, this seems overestimated. The code is purely import statements with no dynamic or risky behavior. The small score (0.1) is acceptable but perhaps slightly high; a 0.0 would be more accurate unless there's context not visible here.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others; standard imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is only import statements with no malicious activity.\n- The only point of contention is Report 4's securityRisk score of 0.1, which appears slightly inflated given the code's simplicity.\n\n### Malware and Obfuscated Scores:\n- All are 0, which is appropriate. No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n\n### Risk Scores:\n- All are 0 or very close to 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at 0 for all reports.\n- **Malware:** Keep at 0 for all reports.\n- **SecurityRisk:** For Report 4, consider lowering from 0.1 to 0.0, as the code does not present any security risk.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code snippets are benign, standard import statements.\n- No evidence suggests malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature, except for the minor securityRisk in Report 4, which can be adjusted.\n\n**My estimated scores for this code:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code, with no suspicious or risky elements.",
