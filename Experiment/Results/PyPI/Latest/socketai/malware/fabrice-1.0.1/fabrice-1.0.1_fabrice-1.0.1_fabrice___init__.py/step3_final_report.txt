{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or API exposure point, importing internal components for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module files _version, connection, runners, group, tasks, and executor during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to import statements; no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only loads modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward import statements from internal modules, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or external data handling. The absence of data flows, suspicious code, or anomalies indicates a benign and standard package setup. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module import block with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
