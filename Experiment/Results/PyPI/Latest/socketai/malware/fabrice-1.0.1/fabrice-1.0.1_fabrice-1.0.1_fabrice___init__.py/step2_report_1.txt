  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details and scores provided.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules.\n- No data flows, external inputs, or outputs are present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard module initialization or API exposure pattern.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code:**  \n   All reports conclude that there are no signs of malware, suspicious activity, or security risks. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py or similar module.\n\n2. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - Malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n   - Security risk scores are mostly 0, with one report assigning 0.1, which seems slightly cautious but still low.\n\n3. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, higher scores are unwarranted. The low scores seem appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n   The reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize that import statements alone do not constitute security risks.\n\n5. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- Given the analysis, **0** is appropriate. No malicious behavior is detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **0**, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- Since the code only performs imports with no suspicious activity, a low risk score (around 0.0 to 0.1) is justified. The one report's 0.1 is acceptable but slightly cautious.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (to account for cautiousness, but effectively negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe import module with no security concerns. The scores should remain very low, reflecting the benign nature of the snippet.",
