  "purpose": "Configure and set up the 'fabrice' package with environment-based naming, version retrieval, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, directory checks, '_version.py' file, 'README.rst' file",
  "sinks": "Execution of '_version.py' via exec(), reading files, setting up package metadata",
  "flows": "Environment variable and directory checks influence package and binary names; exec() runs code from '_version.py'; README content is read for description",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on '_version.py' without validation; no validation or sanitization of external files",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package, including environment-based configuration, version reading via exec(), and metadata setup. The primary security concern is the use of exec() to execute '_version.py', which could be malicious if the file is compromised. No network activity, credentials, or suspicious code are present. The code is straightforward and typical for such scripts. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior, acknowledging the minor risk associated with exec(). The overall structure and logic are benign, with the only caveat being the trust placed in '_version.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent. The use of exec() on '_version.py' is a common pattern but should be trusted or validated to mitigate minimal risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code analysis.",
