      "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits a high-risk pattern by executing arbitrary code during installation without validation, which could be exploited maliciously. While no malicious payload is confirmed, the pattern itself is dangerous and warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the severity, with malware around 0.7 and security risk near 0.85, indicating a significant supply chain security concern."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits covert data collection and transmission to suspicious domains, indicating malicious or tracking behavior. While it does not contain payloads like code injection, its activity is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, warranting high security concern and further investigation."
