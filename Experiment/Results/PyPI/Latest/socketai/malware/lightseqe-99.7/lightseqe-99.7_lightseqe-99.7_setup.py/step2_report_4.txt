  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating their reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The core concern is the execution of `main()` from a local module during the package's installation process.\n- No obfuscation or hidden code is evident; the code is straightforward.\n- The potential for malicious activity hinges on whether `main.py` contains harmful code, which is unknown here.\n- The scores assigned are generally consistent with the described behavior, but some may overstate or understate the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- The code **does** execute `main()` during installation, which is unusual and potentially dangerous.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads in the code snippet itself, but the behavior could be exploited if `main.py` is malicious.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n\n- The reports assume that executing `main()` is inherently malicious or dangerous. While it is suspicious, it is not necessarily malicious unless `main.py` contains harmful code.\n- The malware scores are somewhat high (ranging from 0.3 to 0.6), but without inspecting `main.py`, these are speculative.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately high, given the potential for arbitrary code execution.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n\n- **Malware score:** The reports assign scores from 0.3 to 0.6, which seems reasonable given the behavior. Since no malicious code is demonstrated, these are conservative estimates.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.5 to 0.75; consistent with the potential for malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly assigned as 0; no obfuscation is present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The main concern is executing external code during install, which is a security best practice violation.\n- The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments necessary unless more context about `main.py` is provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** ~0.3 — moderate concern, but no evidence of malicious code.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n**Risk score:** ~0.6 — significant because of arbitrary code execution, but not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe core issue is the execution of `main()` during installation, which could be exploited if `main.py` is malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are generally aligned with this concern. No evidence suggests actual malware, but the pattern is suspicious and warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** For a definitive risk assessment, inspecting the contents of `main.py` is essential. Without that, the conservative approach is to treat this as a potential supply chain risk.",
