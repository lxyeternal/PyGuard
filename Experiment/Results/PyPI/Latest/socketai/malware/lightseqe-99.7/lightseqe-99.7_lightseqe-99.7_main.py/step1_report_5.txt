  "purpose": "Collect system information and send it to multiple remote URLs for tracking or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), random.randint()",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() which sends data over the network",
  "flows": "System info (hostname, username, current directory) and a random number are sent via HTTP GET requests to external URLs",
  "anomalies": "The URLs appear suspicious and are hosted on domains associated with tracking or potentially malicious activities. The code sends system data without user consent or notification. Use of a random number as a URL path parameter may be to bypass simple detection.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information such as hostname, username, and current directory. It generates a random number, then constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains, appending system info and the random number as URL parameters. It attempts to open these URLs and logs responses or errors. The domains do not belong to legitimate services and appear to be designed for data exfiltration or tracking. There is no user notification or consent mechanism. The code's purpose seems to be covertly transmitting system data to external servers, which can be malicious or intrusive.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to secretly gather and transmit system information to external servers, indicating malicious intent. The suspicious domains and data exfiltration behavior strongly suggest malicious behavior. The code should be considered a security risk and potentially malicious.",
