  "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and poses a security risk, especially if 'main.py' contains malicious code. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main()', the pattern itself should be treated with caution. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a higher malware concern, around 0.5, and a security risk around 0.75, to account for this inherent danger."
