  "purpose": "Collect system information including hostname, username, current directory, and MAC addresses, encode the MAC addresses in base64, and send this data to multiple external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.node() for hostname, getpass.getuser() for username, os.getcwd() for current directory, get_mac_addresses() function executing system commands to retrieve MAC addresses, and random.randint() for generating a random number.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests to external URLs with encoded parameters containing system info.",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses, random number) are encoded and appended as URL parameters; these URLs are accessed via urllib.request.urlopen(), transmitting data to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to execute system commands to retrieve MAC addresses, which can be manipulated or cause security issues; sending system info to external domains without encryption or user consent; obfuscated URL domains that appear suspicious; no user notification or consent mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The script collects various system details, encodes the MAC addresses in base64, and sends this data to three external URLs. The URLs are non-standard and appear suspicious, possibly indicating data exfiltration. The code does not include any authentication or encryption, raising privacy and security concerns. Use of subprocess to gather MAC addresses can be exploited for malicious purposes if manipulated. No obvious malicious payloads like code execution, data theft, or system modification are present, but the exfiltration behavior itself is suspicious and potentially malicious. The lack of user notification or consent, combined with suspicious domains, suggests malicious intent or at least privacy-invasive behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily gathers system information and transmits it to external servers, which could be used for tracking or data theft. No direct malware actions such as damaging files or unauthorized system access are evident, but the data exfiltration behavior and suspicious domains pose security and privacy risks. The overall activity is potentially malicious, with a malware score likely around 0.3 due to data exfiltration tendencies.",
