  "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration tool, gathering sensitive system info and transmitting it to suspicious domains without user consent. While it lacks active malicious payloads, its stealthy nature and suspicious endpoints suggest malicious intent. The malware score is high (1) if considering covert exfiltration as malicious, but given no active payloads, a score around 0.6 is appropriate. The security risk is high due to privacy invasion and covert data transfer. Overall, the script poses a significant security concern and warrants caution."
