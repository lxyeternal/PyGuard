  "purpose": "Collect system information (hostname, username, MAC addresses, current directory) and send it to external URLs encoded in base64, potentially for tracking or reconnaissance.",
  "sources": "Reads system info (platform.node, getpass.getuser, os.getcwd), MAC addresses via subprocess calls, and random number generator (random.randint).",
  "sinks": "URLs constructed with system info and sent via urllib.request.urlopen, which performs HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "flows": "System info and MAC addresses are collected, encoded, then appended as URL parameters and sent to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "The code communicates with multiple external domains that appear suspicious or malicious, based on their structure. The use of base64 encoding of MAC addresses suggests an attempt to obfuscate or prepare data for exfiltration. The code does not process response data or handle data securely, and the domains are potentially malicious. The URL structure indicates command-and-control or data collection behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses via platform-specific commands. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, possibly to avoid detection or for data obfuscation. The script constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and performs HTTP GET requests with system info as URL parameters. No response data is processed, and exceptions are silently ignored. The external domains are non-standard and could be used for malicious purposes such as tracking, reconnaissance, or command-and-control communication. The code appears intentionally designed to silently exfiltrate system data without user consent or knowledge.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious behavior characteristic of reconnaissance or data exfiltration. It collects system details and transmits them to external, suspicious domains without user consent or security measures. The URL structure and data encoding suggest malicious intent, likely for tracking or covert data collection. No evidence of backdoors or malicious payloads like code execution or data theft beyond information gathering is present, but the data collection and transmission pattern is suspicious.",
