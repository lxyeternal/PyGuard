  "purpose": "Collect system information including MAC addresses, hostname, username, current directory, and send encoded data to external URLs.",
  "sources": "platform.system(), platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd(), get_mac_addresses() function (reading system commands and network interfaces), base64 encoding, and URL parameters.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() calls to external URLs with parameters containing system info, especially the encoded MAC addresses and other system details.",
  "flows": "System info sources (platform, getpass, os, MAC address retrieval) feed into encoding and URL parameter construction, then data is sent via HTTP GET requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domains, including obast.cn, i18n.oast-row, and oast.fun, which are commonly used for malicious C2 or data exfiltration. Base64 encoding of MAC addresses and sending to these domains is suspicious. The code does not log or verify responses. No user-visible indication of data transmission.",
  "analysis": "The code collects MAC addresses via platform-dependent system commands, gathers hostname, username, current directory, and encodes MAC addresses in base64. It constructs URLs pointing to suspicious domains and sends GET requests with the collected info as URL parameters. No validation or filtering is done on data before transmission. The use of oast domains indicates potential exfiltration or command and control activities. No malicious payload or command execution is evident, but the data collection and transmission pattern are characteristic of data exfiltration or malicious tracking. The code does not perform any harmful actions directly but communicates sensitive info to external servers, which is suspicious in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The script covertly collects system information and sends it to potentially malicious or suspicious external domains, indicating malicious intent for data exfiltration or tracking. The use of oast domains and base64 encoding of MAC addresses raises security concerns. While no destructive actions are performed, the data leakage to untrusted endpoints is suspicious and warrants caution.",
