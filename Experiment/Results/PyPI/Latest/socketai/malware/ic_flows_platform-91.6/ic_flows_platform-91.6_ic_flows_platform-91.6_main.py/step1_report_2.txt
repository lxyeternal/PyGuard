  "purpose": "Collect system information such as MAC addresses, hostname, username, and current directory, then send this data encoded in base64 via HTTP GET requests to multiple URLs.",
  "sources": "Reading system info (platform.node(), getpass.getuser(), os.getcwd()), obtaining MAC addresses via subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen() used to send HTTP GET requests to external URLs with system data as query parameters.",
  "flows": "System info sources (hostname, username, current directory, MAC addresses) -> URL construction with encoded MAC addresses -> HTTP requests to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of multiple external URLs with suspicious domain names, encoding MAC addresses in base64, and sending data without validation or consent. No explicit user input but gathers and transmits potentially sensitive data. The URLs look suspicious and could be used for data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script gathers system information including hostname, username, current working directory, and MAC addresses from the host system. MAC addresses are encoded in base64, then sent as URL parameters to three potentially malicious URLs. The code uses subprocess calls to retrieve MAC addresses, which could be a technique to evade detection. The URLs appear suspicious and could be part of a data exfiltration or tracking setup. There are no obvious malicious actions such as executing arbitrary code, backdoors, or system damage. However, the data collection and transmission to unknown servers without user consent indicates potentially malicious intent, such as privacy invasion or covert data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code secretly collects and encodes system information, then transmits it to suspicious external servers. While no active malicious code like backdoors or malware is evident, the data collection and transmission behavior, combined with suspicious URLs, indicate malicious or privacy-invasive activity. The overall risk is moderate, leaning towards malicious intent, with potential privacy violations.",
