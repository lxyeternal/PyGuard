      "conclusion": "The code pattern of executing 'main()' during setup is suspicious and poses a security risk, especially if 'main.py' contains malicious code. While the actual maliciousness depends on 'main()', the pattern itself should be treated with caution. The scores should be adjusted to reflect a higher malware concern, around 0.5, and a security risk around 0.75, to account for this inherent danger."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a covert data exfiltration tool, gathering sensitive system info and transmitting it to suspicious domains without user consent. While it lacks active malicious payloads, its stealthy nature and suspicious endpoints suggest malicious intent. The malware score is high (1) if considering covert exfiltration as malicious, but given no active payloads, a score around 0.6 is appropriate. The security risk is high due to privacy invasion and covert data transfer. Overall, the script poses a significant security concern and warrants caution."
