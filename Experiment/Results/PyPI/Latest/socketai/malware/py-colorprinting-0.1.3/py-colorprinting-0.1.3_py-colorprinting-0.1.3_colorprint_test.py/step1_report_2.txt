{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the exact purpose is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variable reads, or imported modules that handle external data, though no explicit sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, network connections, or file writes, but none are explicitly evident in the visible code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, but the specific flow paths cannot be fully determined from the given code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are apparent. The code structure is straightforward with standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks external input handling, suspicious API calls, or embedded secrets. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or abnormal behaviors. Usage of libraries and functions seems typical, and no obfuscation or unusual patterns are detected. Without additional context or hidden parts, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems safe but limited in scope; full assessment depends on the complete context.",
