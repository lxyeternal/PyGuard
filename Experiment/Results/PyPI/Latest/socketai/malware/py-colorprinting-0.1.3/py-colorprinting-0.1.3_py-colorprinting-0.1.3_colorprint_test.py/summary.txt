  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and reasonable given the lack of code. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at zero. The security risk scores should be adjusted to zero where no code or evidence exists. Confidence levels should be lowered accordingly in reports without code to reflect the uncertainty. Overall, the assessments are sound, with minor adjustments recommended for risk scores in the absence of code."
