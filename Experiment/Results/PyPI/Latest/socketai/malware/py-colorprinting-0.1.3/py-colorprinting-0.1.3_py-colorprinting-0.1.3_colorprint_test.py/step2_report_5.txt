  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the absence or presence of code, the reasoning, and the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No code provided; all fields indicate lack of content.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly notes that analysis cannot be performed without code.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - securityRisk: 0 (appropriate)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No code provided; all fields indicate lack of content.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly states that no analysis can be performed.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — this seems slightly high given no code or context.\n- **Recommendation:** Since there's no code, assigning a security risk score of 0.2 is unjustified. The risk score should be 0, as there's no evidence or indication of risk.\n- **Justification:** Without code, no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors can be inferred.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No code provided.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly states that analysis isn't possible.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No code provided.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly notes the absence of code for analysis.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, which is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** No code provided.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly states no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.1 — again, with no code, this seems slightly high.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score should be 0 for the same reasons as above.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- For reports with no code (Reports 1, 3, 4), the scores are appropriate.\n- For reports with some reasoning but no code (Reports 2 and 5), the assigned `securityRisk` scores of 0.2 and 0.1 are unjustified. These should be lowered to 0 because without code, no risk can be inferred.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remains 0 across all reports, as no code is provided.\n- **Malware score:** Remains 0 across all reports, as no malicious activity can be identified without code.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0 in all cases lacking code, as no evidence of risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are generally correct in their lack of findings, but the assigned small risk scores in reports 2 and 5 should be revised downward to 0, reflecting the absence of any code or evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Remove or adjust the `securityRisk` scores in reports 2 and 5 to 0.  \n- Confirm that all reports with no code have zero malware, obfuscated, and risk scores.",
