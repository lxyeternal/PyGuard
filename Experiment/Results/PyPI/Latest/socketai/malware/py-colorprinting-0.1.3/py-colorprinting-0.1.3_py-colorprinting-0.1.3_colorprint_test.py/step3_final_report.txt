  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, user input, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, system commands, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious API calls, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports lack actual code snippets, relying solely on descriptions. The assessments correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the lack of code. The small security risk scores (0.1-0.2) are conservative but slightly overstated given no evidence; they should be adjusted to 0. In reports where confidence is high despite no code, confidence should be lowered to match the absence of evidence. Overall, the evaluations are reasonable, but risk scores in the absence of code should be minimized.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and reasonable given the lack of code. The malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate at zero. The security risk scores should be adjusted to zero where no code or evidence exists. Confidence levels should be lowered accordingly in reports without code to reflect the uncertainty. Overall, the assessments are sound, with minor adjustments recommended for risk scores in the absence of code.",
