  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from .core import ColorPrint\n     ```\n   - This is a standard pattern in Python packages to expose classes or functions at the package level.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, dynamic code execution, external network calls, or other complex behaviors.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, serving only as package initialization.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, perform any I/O beyond import, or contain any logic that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated scores are all 0, consistent with the clear, minimal code.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, reflecting the lack of vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Issues:**\n   - Since all reports agree and the code is straightforward, there are no issues with the reasoning or scoring.\n   - The high confidence (1) scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a standard package initialization pattern with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest any hidden malicious intent or security vulnerabilities in this minimal import statement.",
