  "purpose": "Expose the ColorPrint class from the core module, serving as a package initializer.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .core: 'from .core import ColorPrint'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely an import statement with no external communication.",
  "flows": "Import source flows directly to the namespace; no data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python package __init__.py import statement. It does not process data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. High confidence is justified due to the straightforward nature of the code, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization snippet with no security risks or malicious intent. The provided reports are accurate and appropriate, with scores reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
