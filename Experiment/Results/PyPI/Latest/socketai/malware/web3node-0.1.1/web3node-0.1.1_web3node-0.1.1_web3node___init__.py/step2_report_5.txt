  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**Original Code Summary:**\n- Defines version info (`version_info`, `__version__`)\n- Declares `__all__` for exports\n- Imports three local modules: `.darwin`, `.win32`, `.gnu` via wildcard imports\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or suspicious patterns\n- No obfuscation, no malware, straightforward module setup\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No issues, straightforward static code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The code is benign and matches the report's conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1; standard package initialization with platform-specific imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to import statements)\n\n**Verdict:** Also accurate. The only minor point is the slight security risk due to platform-specific imports, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard module setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward version info and imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Notes the use of wildcard imports (`from .darwin import *`), which can be a concern for code clarity and maintainability but not inherently malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (due to wildcard import)\n\n**Justification:** Wildcard imports can sometimes mask malicious code if the imported modules contain malicious code, but in this context, they are local modules, and there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, all reports agree that the code is benign.\n- **Malware:** All scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated code:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly due to import practices, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- The only minor concern is the use of wildcard imports (`*`), which could be flagged for maintainability but not maliciousness.\n- Since the code is static, has no dynamic execution, no untrusted input, and only local module imports, the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to wildcard imports, but overall very low)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign module initialization script with no security issues. The existing scores are appropriate, and I agree with the assessments provided.",
