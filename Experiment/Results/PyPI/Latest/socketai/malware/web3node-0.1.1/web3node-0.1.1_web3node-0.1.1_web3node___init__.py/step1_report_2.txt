  "purpose": "Define package version information and import platform-specific modules.",
  "sources": "Reads package version string and imports from local modules darwin, win32, and gnu.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version variables, then importing all contents from darwin, win32, and gnu modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements and version definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version tuple and string, specifies __all__ for exports, then imports all contents from three platform-specific modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The import statements are standard for modular packages. No suspicious patterns or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module initializer that manages platform-specific imports. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.",
