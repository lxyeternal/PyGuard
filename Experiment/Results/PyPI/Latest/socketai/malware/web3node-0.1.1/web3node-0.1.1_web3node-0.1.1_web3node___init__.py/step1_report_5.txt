  "sinks": "None identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) which could mask imported code behavior, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables and performs imports of three modules: darwin, win32, and gnu. The imports are from relative paths, indicating local modules. Wildcard imports are generally discouraged as they can hide what is imported, but in itself, this code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions. There are no network calls, data handling, or credential usage. The code appears to be part of a larger package setup to load platform-specific modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward setup code for a cross-platform Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. The use of wildcard imports is a potential concern for code clarity and maintainability but not maliciousness.",
