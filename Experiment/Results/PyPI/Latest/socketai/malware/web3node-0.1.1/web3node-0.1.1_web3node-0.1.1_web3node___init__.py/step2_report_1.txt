  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines version info via tuple and string.\n- Declares `__all__` with [\"win32\", \"gnu\", \"darwin\"].\n- Performs static imports of local modules: `.darwin`, `.win32`, `.gnu`.\n- No dynamic code, user input, environment variables, or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Standard version info and static imports.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no dynamic code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; straightforward import and version setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The slight securityRisk of 0.1 is reasonable, given no actual risk but a minor concern about import structure.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; local platform-specific modules, no suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard module setup.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; straightforward, no malicious logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Noted the use of wildcard imports (`from .darwin import *`). While discouraged, this alone isn't malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; setup code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The observation about wildcard imports is valid, but they are common in package setup files and do not imply malicious intent. The risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, though some might argue it could be 0 if considering only maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is benign.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1), justified by the use of wildcard imports, which are a best practice concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a typical module initializer for a cross-platform package.\n- No dynamic execution, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- Wildcard imports are discouraged but not malicious.\n- No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to wildcard imports, but overall low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well within normal expectations for a package setup script. The scores in the reports are appropriate, with the minor concern about wildcard imports justifying a very low risk score.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** No changes needed. The assessments are consistent with the code's nature.",
