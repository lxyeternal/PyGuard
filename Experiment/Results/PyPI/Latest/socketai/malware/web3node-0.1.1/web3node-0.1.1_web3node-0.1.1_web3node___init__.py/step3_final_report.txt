  "purpose": "Define version information and import platform-specific modules for cross-platform support.",
  "sources": "Static import statements of local modules (.darwin, .win32, .gnu). No external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Static imports from local modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (from .darwin import *) which can obscure imported symbols but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version info and performs static imports of local platform-specific modules. No dynamic code execution, user input, environment variables, or obfuscation detected. Wildcard imports are discouraged for maintainability but do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module initializer for a cross-platform package. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the import practices, while not ideal, do not pose security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
