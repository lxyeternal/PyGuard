  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the web3node Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'web3node/__init__.py' via regex.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Reading version file (source) to assign package version (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version; potential manipulation if source file is compromised, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input. The regex-based version extraction could be manipulated if the source file is maliciously altered, but this is a common pattern and unlikely to be malicious unless the source is compromised. Dependencies are standard, and no suspicious patterns are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the low security risk score (~0.1) reflects minimal concern. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard packaging script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk score accounts for potential manipulation of the version file, but this is a low-probability concern. Overall, the package is safe to use.",
