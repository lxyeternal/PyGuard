  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'web3node' Python package",
  "sources": "Reading version string from 'web3node/__init__.py', importing setup functions, and specifying dependencies",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present in this code",
  "flows": "The version string is extracted from a file and used in the setup process; dependencies are specified for installation",
  "anomalies": "Use of 're.search' to dynamically extract version info, which is typical but can be manipulated if the file content is maliciously altered. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file used for packaging a Python project. It conditionally imports setup, reads the version from a source file, and calls setup() with package metadata. No untrusted data sources, user inputs, or network activities are involved. The dependencies listed are common and unrelated to malicious behavior. The version extraction via regex is standard but could be exploited if the file content is compromised, although this is unlikely here. Overall, the code appears legitimate and focused solely on package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads package version info, specifies dependencies, and prepares the package for distribution. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
