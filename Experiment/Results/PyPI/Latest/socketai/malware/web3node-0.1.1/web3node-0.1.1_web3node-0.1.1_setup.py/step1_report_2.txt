  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'web3node' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads the version string from 'web3node/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leaks or untrusted data processing points.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> used in setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward setup code with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to extract the package version from 'web3node/__init__.py' via regex, which is common. It then calls setup() with package details, dependencies, and metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. All dependencies are standard, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs typical package configuration without suspicious or malicious code elements.",
