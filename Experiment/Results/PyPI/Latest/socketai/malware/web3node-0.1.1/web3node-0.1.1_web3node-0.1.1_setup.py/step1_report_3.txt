{
  "purpose": "To set up the package 'web3node' for distribution, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string from 'web3node/__init__.py'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from file, then passing metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of a regex to extract version info from source code is typical but can be risky if the file contents are manipulated; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to retrieve the package version from 'web3node/__init__.py' via regex, which is common. The setup() call defines package metadata and dependencies. The dependencies include 'pyinstaller', which is used to create standalone executables, but this is a legitimate build tool and not inherently malicious. No code injection, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard package setup with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It properly reads version info, specifies dependencies, and prepares the package for distribution.",
