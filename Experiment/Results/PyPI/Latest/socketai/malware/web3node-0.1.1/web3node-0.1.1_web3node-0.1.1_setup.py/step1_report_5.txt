  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'web3node' Python module",
  "sources": "Reading version string from 'web3node/__init__.py'; importing setup functions; reading package data and requirements",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks detected; no network or system modification operations",
  "flows": "Reading version string from file → passing version to setup function",
  "anomalies": "None detected; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports setup tools, extracts version info from the package's __init__.py, and calls setup() with package metadata and requirements. It relies on standard Python packaging practices. The version extraction uses a regex on the package's init file, which is typical. No network operations, system modifications, or malicious code included. The install_requires list includes common libraries, with no suspicious entries. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script for packaging a module. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code appears safe and aligns with common package distribution practices.",
