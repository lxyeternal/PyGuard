  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is just a module import and version string assignment, with no data flows, sinks, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Potential issues:** None; the report's conclusion is sound.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard package initialization code with no external data handling.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is justified; no malware or malicious intent.\n- **Potential issues:** None; the reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, only import statements and version info; no input/output or system modifications.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 remains appropriate.\n- **Potential issues:** None; the assessment aligns with the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—imports and version string, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is correct.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Identical to previous reports—simple import statements and version declaration.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is justified.\n- **Potential issues:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a straightforward package initializer for terminal styling, with no data flows, external communication, or suspicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is accurate; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious intent, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code snippet is very minimal and typical for an open-source package's `__init__.py` file.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are present.\n- The consistent scoring across reports is justified.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, standard package setup code with no security concerns.",
