  "purpose": "This module appears to provide terminal styling and control functions, including ANSI escape sequences and Windows console compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and classes from local modules: 'initialise', 'ansi', and 'ansitowin32'. No external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident; the code only imports and defines a version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The version string is static, which is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a version declaration. It references internal modules related to terminal styling and Windows console handling. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. The license comment indicates open-source licensing but does not affect security. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward terminal styling utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
