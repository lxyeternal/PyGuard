{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text styling, including colors, cursor movement, and screen clearing.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attribute values, function parameters (like 'title', 'mode', 'n', 'x', 'y'), and uses string concatenation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the functions returning ANSI escape sequences that could be used to control terminal output or potentially inject escape sequences maliciously if misused.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., 'title', 'mode', 'n', 'x', 'y') flow into functions that generate escape sequences, which are then returned as strings. These strings are used to control terminal behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution present. The code is straightforward, primarily generating terminal control sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for ANSI escape sequences and provides functions to generate control codes for terminal operations such as setting titles, clearing screens/lines, moving the cursor, and setting text colors. Classes encapsulate ANSI codes for foreground, background, and styles, initializing instance attributes with escape sequences derived from class attribute values. The structure is clear and typical for terminal styling utilities. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code does not execute any untrusted input or perform network operations, and the functions return control sequences for terminal output without executing or altering system state beyond terminal control.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard ANSI terminal styling utility with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply generates escape sequences for terminal control, and all components are consistent with this purpose.",
