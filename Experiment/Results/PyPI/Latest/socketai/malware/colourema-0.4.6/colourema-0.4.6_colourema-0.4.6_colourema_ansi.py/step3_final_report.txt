{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, including text colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "Functions like code_to_chars, set_title, clear_screen, clear_line, and class attributes in AnsiCodes and its subclasses that define color and style codes.",
  "sinks": "The functions return strings representing escape sequences; no untrusted data is processed or output directly, so no sinks pose a security risk.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., color codes, position coordinates, title strings) flow into functions that generate escape sequences; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and does not perform dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for ANSI terminal styling, with functions that generate escape sequences based on static or parameterized inputs. It does not process external data, execute code dynamically, or connect to networks. The structure is simple, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The purpose is purely to facilitate terminal formatting, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
