{
  "purpose": "Generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor positioning.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is hardcoded within class attributes or method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate escape sequences and control terminal behavior, potentially affecting terminal output.",
  "flows": "Method calls like 'set_title', 'clear_screen', or 'AnsiCursor' methods create escape sequences based on input parameters; these sequences are sent to the terminal but do not process untrusted external data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior observed. The code mainly defines constants and simple functions/classes for ANSI codes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions and classes for creating ANSI escape sequences for text formatting and cursor control in terminals. It uses static class attributes for color codes and straightforward methods for generating escape sequences. No input validation issues, no external data processing, and no side effects or network activity. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate terminal text styling, with no indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for terminal styling using ANSI escape codes. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is safe and does not pose security risks.",
