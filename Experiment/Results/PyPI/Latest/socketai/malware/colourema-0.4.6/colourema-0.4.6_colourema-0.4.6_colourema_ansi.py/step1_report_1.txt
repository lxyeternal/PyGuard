{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text coloring and cursor movement, mainly for enhancing terminal output display.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; the code defines static methods, constants, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or input is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only generates escape sequences based on static values or method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code relies solely on straightforward string concatenation and class attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes to generate ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling and cursor control. It uses standard string operations and class attributes without dynamic code execution or external data handling. The methods are simple wrappers for static sequences, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. The design is typical for terminal formatting utilities, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign terminal styling utility library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no external input handling, no data leakage, and no suspicious network activity. The code appears safe for use.",
