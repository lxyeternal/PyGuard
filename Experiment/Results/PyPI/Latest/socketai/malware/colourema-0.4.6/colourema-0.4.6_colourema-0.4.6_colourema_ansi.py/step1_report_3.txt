{
  "purpose": "This module generates ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting, including colors and cursor control.",
  "sources": "Definitions of ANSI codes, class attribute values, and functions generating escape sequences.",
  "sinks": "Functions that output escape sequences, but no direct untrusted input handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Class attribute values are converted into escape sequences during object instantiation, but no flow of untrusted data is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code primarily defines constants and formatting functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for ANSI escape codes and provides functions and classes to generate these codes. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. The class structures and functions are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign utility module for terminal text formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal formatting. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
