{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to generate ANSI escape codes for terminal text formatting, including colors, styles, and cursor movements.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs; all data comes from predefined constants and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Generated ANSI escape sequences are used as output to terminals; no untrusted data input or external network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data or system manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; functions and classes are straightforward, with no obfuscated logic or hidden behaviors. The code strictly generates terminal escape sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and classes for creating ANSI escape sequences for text coloring, styling, and cursor control in terminal environments. The functions use straightforward string concatenation to produce escape sequences. The classes initialize instance attributes with escape sequences based on class attribute values. There are no external data inputs, no network connections, or code execution beyond string formatting. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The implementation appears to be a standard utility module for terminal formatting, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility for generating ANSI escape sequences for terminal text formatting. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. It is safe to use and has no signs of malware or security threats.",
