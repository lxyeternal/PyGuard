{
  "purpose": "Provides Windows console manipulation functions such as setting colors, styles, cursor position, clearing screen/lines, and enabling VT processing.",
  "sources": "Reads system console buffer info, console handle, and input/output handles via win32 API calls.",
  "sinks": "Uses console handles to set attributes, cursor position, and title; no untrusted data processing or external data flow.",
  "flows": "Function calls to win32 API functions manipulate console attributes and cursor positions; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Windows console utility library, wrapping win32 API calls for styling, cursor, and screen control. The enable_vt_processing function safely attempts to enable ANSI sequences. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions handle parameters appropriately, and no untrusted input is processed. The code is clear, well-structured, and purpose-specific.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Windows console utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
