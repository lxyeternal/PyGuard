{
  "purpose": "This module provides classes for handling ANSI escape sequences in terminal output, including converting them to Windows API calls or stripping them from output streams.",
  "sources": "Reading input or data from stream objects such as sys.stdout, sys.stderr, or other wrapped streams; extracting ANSI sequences using regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "Writing processed text to output streams; calling Windows API functions for terminal manipulation; changing terminal title via winterm.set_title.",
  "flows": "Input streams are wrapped, and when write() is called, the data passes through convert_osc() and regex matches (ANSI_CSI_RE, ANSI_OSC_RE), which may invoke win32 calls or modify text before writing to the output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution; no hidden network activity, file system access, or credential theft observed; use of regex for ANSI sequences is standard. The code manages terminal styling and title setting, which are typical functions.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly focuses on processing terminal output streams, converting ANSI escape sequences into Windows API calls or stripping them as needed. It uses regex patterns to detect ANSI sequences and then calls Windows functions for styling, cursor movement, and terminal clearing. The logic appears standard for terminal handling libraries. No suspicious data flow, external network access, or backdoors are present. No hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are detected. The functionality aligns with legitimate terminal output management, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard terminal styling and conversion utility, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any malicious network activity or system modifications outside terminal styling. Therefore, it poses minimal security concern.",
