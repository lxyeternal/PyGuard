  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a unit test suite verifying ANSI escape code constants for colors and styles.\n- It imports standard modules and local modules for ANSI codes.\n- It checks that the constants match expected ANSI sequences.\n- It ensures that `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are not wrapped with `AnsiToWin32` before tests.\n- The tests are purely static assertions with no dynamic data, network activity, or execution of untrusted code.\n- The code restores system streams after tests, avoiding side effects.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No, the code only performs constant verification and system stream checks.\n- **Malicious or suspicious code:** No, no malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Data leaks or external effects:** No, the code does not handle external data or perform I/O beyond testing constants.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None apparent; the code is a straightforward test suite.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk detected.\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is static, with no dynamic or external inputs.\n- It only verifies predefined constants.\n- No execution of untrusted code or data.\n- No network or file system interactions.\n- The only system modification is temporary stream wrapping, which is properly restored.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports consistently describe the code as a benign, standard unit test verifying ANSI escape sequences.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the detailed review, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, standard unit test suite with no security concerns.",
