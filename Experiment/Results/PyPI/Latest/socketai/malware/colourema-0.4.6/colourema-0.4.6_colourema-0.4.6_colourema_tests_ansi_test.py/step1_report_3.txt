  "purpose": "Unit testing the ANSI color code definitions and related attributes for a terminal styling library.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, unittest, and local modules; usage of sys.stdout and sys.stderr; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform output effects based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely performs attribute verification and restores stdout/stderr.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code; the code performs straightforward assertions on predefined constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test case class that checks the correctness of ANSI escape sequences for various foreground, background, and style attributes. It uses standard unittest framework features without involving external data or executing untrusted code. There are no input streams, network connections, or dynamic code execution; the code is purely static tests of constants. The code also restores stdout and stderr after tests, avoiding side effects. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests verifying static constants for terminal styling. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious activities, or security risks detected. The code is safe and solely for testing purposes.",
