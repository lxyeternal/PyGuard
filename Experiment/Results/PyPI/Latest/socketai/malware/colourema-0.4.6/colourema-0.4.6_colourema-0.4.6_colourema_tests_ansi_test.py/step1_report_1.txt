  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for ANSI escape code constants and their correctness, specifically for terminal color and style attributes.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, unittest, and local modules for ANSI codes and terminal handling.",
  "sinks": "None that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks that could cause security issues. The code primarily performs assertions on predefined constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists solely of tests and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local modules to verify ANSI escape code constants. It performs assertions to confirm correct mapping of color and style constants. The setUp and tearDown methods temporarily modify sys.stdout and sys.stderr, but only for test purposes, restoring the original objects afterward. There are no input sources that could lead to malicious behavior, no data being transmitted, and no execution of untrusted data or commands. The code is straightforward and intended for unit testing, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test suite validating ANSI code constants. It contains no malicious or security-compromising code, no data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code serves solely for testing purposes and does not interact with untrusted data sources or external systems.",
