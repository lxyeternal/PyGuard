{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite verifying ANSI escape code constants for foreground, background, and style attributes, ensuring they match expected ANSI sequences.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported modules for ANSI codes and system streams (sys.stdout, sys.stderr) during setup and teardown.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code only performs assertions and temporarily modifies system streams for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing constants, asserting their values, and managing system stream states; no external data or untrusted input flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is static, straightforward, and only verifies predefined constants with proper setup and cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static test suite verifying ANSI escape code constants for text styling. It imports standard modules and local modules, performs assertions to confirm constants match expected ANSI sequences, and manages system streams during tests. There are no dynamic inputs, external network activity, or code execution from untrusted sources. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The test assertions are simple and safe, and the setup/teardown procedures ensure no side effects remain after tests. Overall, the code is benign, static, and serves a validation purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static unit test suite verifying ANSI styling constants. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
