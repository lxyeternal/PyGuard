{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test suite for verifying ANSI escape code constants related to text styling, foreground, and background colors.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and the sys module (sys.stdout and sys.stderr) during setup and teardown.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; the code only asserts constant values and restores system streams.",
  "flows": "The code verifies that constant values match expected ANSI escape sequences without passing untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code strictly performs static assertions of constants.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and internal modules related to ANSI styling. It checks the types of system streams to ensure they are not wrapped with AnsiToWin32, then runs assertions to confirm that ANSI color/style constants are correctly defined. The setup and teardown methods manage the state of sys.stdout and sys.stderr. There are no dynamic inputs, external data, or network operations. The code's structure is typical for a unit test suite, and it contains no suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite verifying static constants and system stream states, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
