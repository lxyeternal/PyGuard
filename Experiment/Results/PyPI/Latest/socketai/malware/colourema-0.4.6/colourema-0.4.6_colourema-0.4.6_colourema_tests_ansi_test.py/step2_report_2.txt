  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are present, if the reasoning is sound, and if the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a unit test suite verifying ANSI escape code constants and ensuring the correct behavior of terminal styling modules.\n- The code only performs static assertions on predefined constants.\n- No dynamic data, no external inputs, no network activity, no code execution from untrusted sources.\n- The code restores system streams after tests, avoiding side effects.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code detected.\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code is a straightforward test suite with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** Malware and security risk scores are correctly set to 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Is there any reason to increase the risk scores?**  \n  **No.** The code is purely for testing constants, with no external data or execution.\n\n- **Are the reasoning and conclusions valid?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is solely to verify constants and system stream states.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\nGiven all the evidence, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign, standard unit test suite verifying static constants.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious code or behavior.  \n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- No external data handling or execution.  \n- Purpose is solely to verify predefined constants.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
