{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for verifying ANSI escape code constants and their correctness, as well as ensuring the proper functioning of the AnsiToWin32 wrapper in a terminal environment.",
  "sources": "Reads from imported modules, including 'sys', 'unittest', and relative imports from the parent package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs static assertions and setup/teardown routines.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of test assertions and import statements; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local packages to perform unit testing of ANSI escape sequences. It verifies that constants are correctly defined and that stdout/stderr are not wrapped before tests. The structure is typical for a test suite, with setup, teardown, and test methods that validate constant values. There are no dynamic inputs, external data handling, or code execution from untrusted sources. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign test module designed to verify ANSI color code constants and terminal behavior. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The code appears safe and purely for validation purposes.",
