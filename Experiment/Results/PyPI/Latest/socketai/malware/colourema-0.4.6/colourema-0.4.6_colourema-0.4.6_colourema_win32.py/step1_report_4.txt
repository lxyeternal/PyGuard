{
  "purpose": "This code provides Windows console manipulation functions, such as setting text attributes, cursor positioning, and window titles, primarily for customizing console output appearance.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'ctypes' and 'ctypes.wintypes' to access Windows API functions; uses 'windll.kernel32' functions for console operations.",
  "sinks": "Calls to Windows API functions that modify console output, such as SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, and others. These functions affect console appearance but do not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "No external input sources or untrusted data flows are present. The code retrieves handles and modifies console state based on internal parameters and API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard Windows API calls for console control; no obfuscated code or unusual logic is present. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system damage behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is designed solely for Windows console customization via standard API functions. It conditionally imports ctypes and attempts to define functions for console info retrieval and modification. All functions perform expected operations with no signs of malicious intent. No data leaks, external communications, or backdoors are present. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The code aligns with legitimate console handling tasks on Windows systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console utility module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It purely manipulates console display properties using official Windows API functions, without any hidden or malicious actions.",
