{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Windows console API wrapper for manipulating console appearance, cursor position, and title using ctypes to call system DLL functions.",
  "sources": "System DLL functions such as GetStdHandle, GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo, SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, GetConsoleMode, SetConsoleMode.",
  "sinks": "Console API functions that modify console state; no untrusted data or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "Calls to console functions with controlled parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; functions are standard API wrappers with straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Windows console API wrapper, utilizing ctypes to interface with system DLLs for console control. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The functions are designed for console appearance management and are called with explicit parameters. No suspicious patterns or security issues are present. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0-0.2) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console utility module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The low malware and risk scores are justified. Overall, it poses no security concern.",
