{
  "purpose": "This code provides Windows console handling functions such as retrieving and setting console screen buffer info, cursor position, text attributes, console title, and mode, primarily for customizing terminal output in a Windows environment.",
  "sources": "Imports modules ctypes, wintypes, and dynamically loads Windows DLL functions to interact with the console. Reads environment through DLL function calls and constants.",
  "sinks": "Uses DLL functions to modify console state, such as SetConsoleTextAttribute, SetConsoleCursorPosition, SetConsoleTitleW, and SetConsoleMode, which can alter terminal behavior but do not directly handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Imports and initializes console handling functions, then exposes functions that manipulate console attributes. These functions call Windows API with parameters derived from internal data structures and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; code is primarily boilerplate for Windows console interactions. The code checks for the availability of DLL functions and provides fallbacks. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads Windows console DLL functions via ctypes, defines structures, and provides wrapper functions for console manipulation. No input parsing or data handling that could lead to injection or data leaks. Functions only call Windows API with parameters derived internally. The code appears to be a standard library for terminal control, with safety checks for DLL function availability. No signs of backdoors, network activity, or malicious intent. It is purely for terminal UI management in Windows environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Windows console handling utility without any signs of malicious behavior. It strictly interacts with Windows API to modify console properties. No malware signals or security risks identified. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily due to its benign purpose.",
