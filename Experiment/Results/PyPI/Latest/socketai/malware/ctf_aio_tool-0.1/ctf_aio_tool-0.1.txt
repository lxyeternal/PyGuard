      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, dynamic execution, and temporary file manipulation, strongly indicating malicious activity. All reports' assessments and scores are consistent and justified. The package should be flagged as malicious, and further static analysis of the decoded code is recommended to confirm payload specifics."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign but contains a syntax error due to incorrect use of '=' in the main guard. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores should reflect a low security risk (0), with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The syntax error does not introduce security concerns but prevents execution. Therefore, the overall security risk is minimal."
