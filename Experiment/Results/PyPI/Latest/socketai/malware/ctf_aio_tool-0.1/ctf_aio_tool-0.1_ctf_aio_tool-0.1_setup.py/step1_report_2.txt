{
  "purpose": "The code modifies the standard installation process to generate and execute obfuscated Python code, potentially for malicious purposes such as establishing a reverse shell.",
  "sources": "The encoded 'code' array which is decoded into Python code; the environment where the script is run; the file '/tmp/11293.py' which is written and executed.",
  "sinks": "The execution of 'os.system' with the decoded code piped through base64 decoding and executed via bash, which could run arbitrary malicious commands.",
  "flows": "The encoded array is decoded into Python code, written to a file, then executed in a subshell via 'os.system' after base64 decoding, enabling remote code execution or reverse shell.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a large array of obfuscated numerical values decoded into Python code; dynamic code execution via 'os.system' with decoded content; writing to a temporary file; use of base64 encoding and decoding; obfuscated and intentionally concealed behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script overrides the install command in setuptools to run additional code during installation. It decodes an obfuscated array of integers into Python code, writes this code to '/tmp/11293.py', then executes a reverse shell command by decoding and executing the generated code. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to establish a reverse shell or run arbitrary malicious code. The use of base64 encoding, writing files to '/tmp', and executing code via 'os.system' are common tactics in malware to conceal malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It appears designed to execute obfuscated code that could establish a reverse shell or perform unauthorized actions during package installation. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and use of temporary files are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
