{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform a custom installation process that involves generating, saving, and executing obfuscated code, which may potentially be malicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads obfuscated bytecode from a list of integers, which it then decodes into a string of code. It also executes a system command that decodes and runs a base64-encoded script.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is written to '/tmp/11293.py' and then executed via a system call that decodes and runs the script, potentially executing malicious code. The base64-encoded string is executed directly using os.system, which executes arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "Bytecode list -> decoding into code -> writing to '/tmp/11293.py' -> execution via 'python3 /tmp/11293.py' -> execution of base64-decoded command via os.system.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated bytecode that is decoded at runtime, and it executes system commands with decoded content, which is a common obfuscation technique for malicious code. The code writes to a temporary file and runs it, which can be suspicious. The use of base64 encoding and system calls to execute decoded scripts indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing necessary modules and defines a custom installation class. Within the run method, it creates a list of integers representing obfuscated code, which it decodes into a string. This code is then written to a temporary file (/tmp/11293.py). Next, it constructs a string to execute that runs the temporary script using Python. It also base64 encodes this command and decodes it at runtime before executing via os.system. The overall process of decoding, writing, and executing code dynamically at installation time is suspicious, especially considering the obfuscation and indirect execution methods used.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates typical obfuscation and dynamic code execution techniques often associated with malicious payloads. It writes a potentially malicious script to a temporary file and executes it. The use of obfuscation, base64 encoding, and runtime decoding strongly indicates malicious intent. The package appears to be intentionally designed to execute hidden or malicious code during installation, representing a high security threat.",
