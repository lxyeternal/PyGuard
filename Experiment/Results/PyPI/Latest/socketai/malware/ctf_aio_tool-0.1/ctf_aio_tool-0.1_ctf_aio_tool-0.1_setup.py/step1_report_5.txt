{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to run a custom installation process that generates a Python script from obfuscated data and executes it in a reverse shell manner.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the obfuscated 'code' array of integers, which is decoded into a script and written to a file in '/tmp/11293.py'.",
  "sinks": "The generated script is executed via a base64-decoded command piped to bash through os.system, which allows arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "The code decodes obfuscated data -> writes to '/tmp/11293.py' -> constructs a base64-encoded string -> decodes and executes it in the shell, enabling remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated bytecode array decoded into a script, then executed immediately via base64 decoding and bash. Usage of 'os.system' with dynamic content, potential reverse shell activity. The code writes to a temp file and executes it, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a large obfuscated bytecode array that is decoded into a script. It then creates a reverse shell command ('python3 /tmp/11293.py'), encodes it in base64, and executes it via 'os.system' with base64 decoding and piping to bash. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code generation, and execution in a temp file strongly indicates malicious intent, likely establishing a reverse shell or executing arbitrary malicious code. The setup function and package metadata appear benign but are overshadowed by this malicious payload execution. Overall, the script is highly suspicious, designed to execute arbitrary code fetched or generated at runtime, indicating malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is malicious, intended to decode and execute an obfuscated script from memory, and run it as a reverse shell, representing a severe security threat. It should be considered malware with high confidence and security risk scores.",
