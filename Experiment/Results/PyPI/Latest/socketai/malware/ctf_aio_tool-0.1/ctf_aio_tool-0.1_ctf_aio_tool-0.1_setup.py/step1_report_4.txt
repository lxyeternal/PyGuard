  "purpose": "Customize the installation process to generate and execute a script dynamically during package installation.",
  "sources": "The encoded bytecode array, the code decoding and deobfuscation process, and the command executing the decoded code via os.system.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is written to '/tmp/11293.py' and then executed via 'os.system' with a base64-decoded string piped into bash.",
  "flows": "Encoded array -> decode and deobfuscate -> write to file -> base64 decode -> execute with os.system",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated bytecode, dynamic code generation, execution of decoded code via os.system, and base64 decoding pipeline. Use of hardcoded temporary file '/tmp/11293.py' for executing potentially malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom installation class that, when run, reconstructs code from an obfuscated byte array by subtracting 30 from each integer, converting it to characters, and forming a string. This string is written to a temporary Python script ('/tmp/11293.py'). Subsequently, it constructs a string for execution by base64-encoding the string 'python3 /tmp/11293.py', then decodes and executes this string via a shell command. The obfuscated bytecode likely contains malicious code, and executing it dynamically poses significant security risks. The code appears designed to conceal its true intent through multiple layers of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation, dynamic code generation, and execution techniques to hide malicious payloads. It is highly suspicious and could lead to system compromise, data theft, or remote code execution. The package demonstrates likely malicious behavior, and its use should be avoided.",
