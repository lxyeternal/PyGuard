{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom installation process that generates, writes, and executes obfuscated Python code during package installation, potentially to perform malicious actions such as reverse shell access.",
  "sources": "Input data is obfuscated code stored in the 'code' list, which is decoded into a script; data is also read from the environment and file system indirectly through the execution process.",
  "sinks": "The decoded code is written to '/tmp/11293.py' and then executed via a base64-decoded command piped into bash, enabling remote or arbitrary code execution.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated code is decoded into a script, saved to a temporary file, then executed in a subprocess via a base64-encoded command pipeline, leading to remote code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated code, hardcoded byte array decoded into executable script, writing to temporary file, and executing code via system call with base64 decoding. The code performs no visible legitimate function other than installation, indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script starts by decoding a list of integers into a Python script, which is then written to '/tmp/11293.py'. It constructs a reverse shell command string ('python3 /tmp/11293.py'), encodes it in base64, and executes it by decoding and piping into bash. The obfuscation and execution method strongly suggest malicious behavior, as this pattern is commonly used for executing hidden or malicious scripts during package installation. No legitimate setup tasks or functionality are evident, only suspicious code obfuscation and remote command execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains clear malicious behavior: it dynamically generates, decodes, and executes a script during installation, likely for malicious remote control or backdoor access. This code is highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
