{
  "purpose": "The code decodes an obfuscated byte array into a script, writes it to a temporary file, and executes it via a base64-decoded command, indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Byte array decoding, writing to '/tmp/11293.py', constructing and executing a base64-encoded command with os.system",
  "sinks": "Execution of decoded code via os.system, writing to /tmp/11293.py, running potentially malicious script",
  "flows": "Byte array -> decode -> write to /tmp/11293.py -> encode command in base64 -> decode and execute via os.system",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated byte array decoded at runtime, writing to a temporary file, executing code via os.system with base64 decoding, pattern consistent with malware techniques",
  "analysis": "The code performs obfuscated decoding of a byte array into a script, writes it to a temporary file, and executes it via a base64-encoded command piped into bash. This pattern is characteristic of malicious payloads, such as reverse shells or backdoors. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and use of temporary files are suspicious and typical of malware. All reports correctly identify these behaviors and assign high malware (1), obfuscation (1), and security risk (1) scores, which are justified given the behavior. The code's pattern indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, with potential for remote code execution or system compromise. No false positives are evident; the analysis aligns with standard malware detection heuristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, dynamic execution, and temporary file manipulation, strongly indicating malicious activity. All reports' assessments and scores are consistent and justified. The package should be flagged as malicious, and further static analysis of the decoded code is recommended to confirm payload specifics.",
