  "conclusion": "The code is benign but contains a syntax error due to incorrect use of '=' in the main guard. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores should reflect a low security risk (0), with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The syntax error does not introduce security concerns but prevents execution. Therefore, the overall security risk is minimal."
