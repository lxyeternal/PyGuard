{
  "purpose": "Defines a simple function that prints 'hello world' and executes it if the script is run directly.",
  "sources": "User running the script; no external input sources used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no external data is sent or received.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only executes a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "Typo in the conditional statement: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\"' instead of 'if __name__ == \"__main__\"'. This syntax error prevents proper script execution and is not malicious but indicates a coding mistake.",
  "analysis": "The code is very simple, containing a function that prints 'hello world'. The conditional check intended to execute the function when run as a script has a typo ('=' instead of '=='), which makes the script not run as intended. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling. The only notable issue is a syntax error that would prevent execution, not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, simple script with a syntax error. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
