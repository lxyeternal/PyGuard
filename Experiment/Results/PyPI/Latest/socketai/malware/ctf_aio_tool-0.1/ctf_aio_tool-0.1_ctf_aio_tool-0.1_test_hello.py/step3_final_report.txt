  "purpose": "A simple Python script defining a function that prints 'hello world' and executing it when run directly.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static code with no data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code executes a print statement with static content.",
  "anomalies": "The main conditional uses '=' instead of '==', causing a syntax error; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function and attempts to run it under the main guard. The main guard contains a syntax error ('=' instead of '=='), which prevents execution. The code is trivial, with no external data handling, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation. The syntax error is a simple coding mistake, not a security vulnerability. All reports correctly identify this issue. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score should be 0 or very close to 0, since the syntax error does not pose a security threat. The overall assessment indicates benign code with a minor syntax mistake that can be easily fixed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but contains a syntax error due to incorrect use of '=' in the main guard. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores should reflect a low security risk (0), with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. The syntax error does not introduce security concerns but prevents execution. Therefore, the overall security risk is minimal.",
