{
  "purpose": "Simple script to print 'hello world'",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in the code",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard output; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data leakage",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only executes a function that prints a static string",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the main check ('=' instead of '==') which prevents proper execution when run as main; no malicious code or suspicious constructs present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function that prints 'hello world' and attempts to call it if the script is executed directly. However, there is a syntax error in the main guard ('if __name__ = '__main__':'), which should be '==' for comparison. This syntax error prevents the main block from executing correctly but does not introduce malicious behavior. No external data, no security issues, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign 'hello world' script with a minor syntax error. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
