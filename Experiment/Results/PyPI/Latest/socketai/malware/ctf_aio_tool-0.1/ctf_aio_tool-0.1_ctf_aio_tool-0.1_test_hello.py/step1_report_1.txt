  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'hello world' when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "Input sources: None explicitly, as the code does not read external input.",
  "sinks": "Output sinks: print() function outputs to standard output.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; the code only outputs a static message.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the conditional statement: 'if __name__ = \"__main__\"' should use '==' for comparison.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'hello' that prints a message. The conditional statement intended to check if the script is run directly contains an assignment ('=') instead of a comparison ('=='), which is a syntax error in Python. This error prevents the script from executing correctly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no external dependencies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, simple script intended to print a message. The only issue is a syntax error due to the incorrect use of '=' instead of '=='. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
