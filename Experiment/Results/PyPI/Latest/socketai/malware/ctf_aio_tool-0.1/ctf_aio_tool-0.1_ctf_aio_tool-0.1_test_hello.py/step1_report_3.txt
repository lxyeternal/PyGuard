{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prints 'hello world' when executed",
  "sources": "No input sources; no data reading occurs",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs to standard output",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in the if statement ('=' instead of '==') which prevents the script from executing as intended; no signs of malicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'hello' that prints a greeting. The conditional check intended to execute 'hello()' when the script is run directly is incorrectly written as 'if __name__ = \"__main__\":', which will cause a syntax error and prevent execution. There are no external data inputs, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign script with a syntactical error that prevents execution. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
