  "purpose": "Initialize system monitoring based on the platform, including input and platform-specific monitoring modules.",
  "sources": "platform.system() for platform detection, InputMonitor().start_monitoring() for input monitoring, MacMonitor().run or WindowsMonitor().run for system-specific monitoring",
  "sinks": "Threads executing monitoring functions, potential data collection points",
  "flows": "platform.system() → threading.Thread for input monitoring → platform-specific monitor run methods",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; standard use of threading and platform detection.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and starts input and system monitoring in separate threads. It imports monitoring classes that are invoked to run. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. The imported modules could perform system monitoring tasks, but their usage here is straightforward and not inherently malicious. There are no suspicious data leaks, network activity, or backdoors evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to set up system and input monitoring in a platform-dependent manner without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It is a typical monitoring initialization script, assuming the imported modules are legitimate. No malicious behavior is evident from this fragment.",
