  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical platform-aware monitoring setup with no direct malicious activity. The main concern lies in the external modules' behavior, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their safety."
