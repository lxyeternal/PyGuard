  "purpose": "Initialize and start platform-specific system monitoring threads for Mac and Windows platforms.",
  "sources": "platform.system() call, threading.Thread target functions (InputMonitor().start_monitoring, MacMonitor().run, WindowsMonitor().run)",
  "sinks": "The thread start functions, which execute monitoring routines possibly capturing system data",
  "flows": "platform.system() output determines which monitoring thread to run; input_monitor thread starts monitoring, followed by platform-specific system monitor threads",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Use of platform detection and threading for monitoring is standard for such tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and starts input monitoring and system monitoring threads accordingly. It imports monitoring classes from system-specific modules, which may collect system data. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert actions. The code appears to implement a typical monitoring initialization routine without suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to start monitoring processes on Mac and Windows systems. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate monitoring setup. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
