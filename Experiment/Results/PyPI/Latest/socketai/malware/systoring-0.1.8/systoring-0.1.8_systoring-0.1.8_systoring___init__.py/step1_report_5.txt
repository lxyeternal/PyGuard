  "purpose": "Import platform-specific monitoring modules and initialize system monitoring components based on the operating system.",
  "sources": "platform.system() function call to determine OS; import statements for modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "platform.system() result determines whether WindowsMonitoring is imported; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; standard conditional import pattern. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. No obfuscation or malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple OS check using platform.system().lower() to conditionally import a Windows-specific module. Other modules are imported unconditionally. The code does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modification. The import statements are standard and safe. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is visible. The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscation or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign platform-dependent module loader with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
