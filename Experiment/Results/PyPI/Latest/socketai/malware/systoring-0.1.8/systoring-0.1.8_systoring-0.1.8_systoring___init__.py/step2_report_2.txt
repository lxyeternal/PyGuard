  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs straightforward platform detection and conditional imports.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code is standard for cross-platform modules, importing OS-specific classes only when appropriate.\n- There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, or code execution beyond imports.\n- The `__all__` list is used appropriately to define exported symbols.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippets do not contain any signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and typical for such use cases.\n- The risk scores assigned are very low (mostly 0.1 or 0), which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- Malware score: consistently 0 across all reports, which is justified.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- Security risk: very low, as the code is simple and safe.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are uniform and consistent, and their assessments seem reasonable.\n- No changes are necessary in the scoring or conclusions.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence level is high (1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero to acknowledge minimal platform-specific logic, but still negligible)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a standard, benign platform-dependent import setup for a cross-platform monitoring framework. No malicious or security concerns are evident.",
