  "sources": "platform.system() call for OS detection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only conditional imports based on OS detection.",
  "flows": "platform.system() -> conditional import of WindowsMonitoring.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import pattern, no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward OS check using platform.system().lower() and conditionally imports WindowsMonitoring if the OS is Windows. It unconditionally imports MacMonitoring, initialize_system_monitoring, and InputMonitor. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard for cross-platform modules, with no dynamic execution or network activity. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are consistent with its benign and simple nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cross-platform import setup with no security concerns or malicious intent. It correctly detects the OS and imports relevant modules without any suspicious behavior.",
