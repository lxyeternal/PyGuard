The main concern lies in the external modules' behavior, which cannot be assessed here. The assigned scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their safety."

While no direct exfiltration commands are visible, the pattern and modules imply malicious intent. The malware score is set at 0.75, and the security risk at 0.75, reflecting significant concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate abstract class template with a significant security concern: the ability to disable SSL verification globally. While not malicious or obfuscated, its potential misuse warrants a high security risk score (~0.6). The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at zero. Proper caution should be exercised when calling _create_unverified_https(), especially in production environments."

It employs common techniques for environment detection and evasion without any malicious payloads or behaviors. The current low malware scores are justified; the overall risk is low. The scores should be adjusted to malware=0.0 and risk≈0.1, aligning with the benign nature of the code."

It should be treated with caution, and improvements such as validation, avoiding shell=True, and explicit error handling are recommended."
