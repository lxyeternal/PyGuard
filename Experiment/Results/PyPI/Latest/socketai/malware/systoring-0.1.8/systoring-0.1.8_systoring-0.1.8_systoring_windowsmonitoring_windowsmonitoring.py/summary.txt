  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high potential for malicious behavior as a spyware or data stealer, primarily due to its extensive data collection, SSL bypass, and covert operation techniques. While no direct exfiltration commands are visible, the pattern and modules imply malicious intent. The malware score is set at 0.75, and the security risk at 0.75, reflecting significant concern."
