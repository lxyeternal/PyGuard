{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a system and browser data stealer, collecting passwords, cookies, history, bookmarks, extensions, wallets, and system information, then packaging and transmitting this data via network senders.",
  "sources": "Modules for system info, browser data paths, configuration files, and input arguments for data collection functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent through sender objects over network connections, potentially to external malicious endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data collection modules gather information → data is packaged into zip files and previews → sender objects transmit data over network.",
  "anomalies": "Uses ssl._create_unverified_context to bypass SSL verification, modules named with 'Stealer' and 'MemoryStorage' suggest malicious intent, no obfuscation or hardcoded credentials visible.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes multiple data collection modules for browsers and system info, runs them concurrently using multiprocessing, packages the collected data, and transmits it via provided sender objects. The SSL bypass indicates an attempt to evade secure communication verification, which is common in malicious data exfiltration tools. The module names and broad data harvesting scope suggest spyware or stealer functionalities. No explicit malicious commands, payloads, or obfuscation are present, but the design aligns with covert data theft tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high potential for malicious behavior as a spyware or data stealer, primarily due to its extensive data collection, SSL bypass, and covert operation techniques. While no direct exfiltration commands are visible, the pattern and modules imply malicious intent. The malware score is set at 0.75, and the security risk at 0.75, reflecting significant concern.",
