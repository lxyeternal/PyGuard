  "purpose": "Setuptools-based setup script for packaging the 'systoring' Python library, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; defines install_requires and extras_require dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and defines package configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Uses standard packaging practices with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools', reads a local README file for the long description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. Dependencies include 'pynput' and platform-specific packages for Windows and MacOS. No suspicious code, obfuscated patterns, or malicious behaviors are present. It performs typical package setup tasks without any data handling or execution that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies. No anomalies, malware, or security issues are detected.",
